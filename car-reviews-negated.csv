Neg,In less than a month we had a dead battery and a flat tire It drives nice and has good pick up But you can not not_see not_the not_hood not_at not_all not_from not_the not_driver not_seat not_and not_judging not_and not_parking is difficult Thee dash is much to deep and takes up a lot of room I do not not_find not_the not_seats not_as not_comfortable and the way the sides stick out further than the strip that should protect your card from denting In 1992 we bought a new Taurus and we really loved it So in 1999 we decided to try a new Taurus I did not not_care not_for not_the not_style not_of not_the not_newer not_version but bought it anyway I do not not_like not_the not_new not_car not_half not_as not_much not_as not_i not_liked not_our not_other not_one It has a very small gas tank I would not not_buy not_a not_Taurus not_if not_I not_had not_it not_to not_do not_over not_I not_would not_rather not_have not_my not_1992 not_back not_I not_dont not_think not_the not_style not_is not_as not_nice not_as not_the not_the not_1992 not_and not_it not_was not_a not_mistake not_to not_change not_the not_style
Neg,You may find the same thing happening to your comfort Now seating comfort may not not_be not_important not_to not_you but it is to me The fuel usage was fine the car did get us there with no problems but it was such an uncomfortable ride for both of us The last business trip I drove to San Francisco I went to Hertz Rentals and got a 1999 Ford Taurus thinking it looked comfortable and professional I found the seating to be uncomfortable for myself as well as for my passenger It offers comforts that the Taurus simply does not not_have not_If not_you not_are not_planning not_a not_long not_trip not_or not_to not_buy not_a not_car not_that not_you not_intend not_to not_be not_comfortably not_seated not_in not_check not_out not_the not_Taurus not_on not_a not_longer not_trial not_basis not_than not_you not_might not_another not_car How important is comfort to you On a long trip being an uncomfortable driver is distracting to me and it made the trip seem unnecessarily longer than it should have felt I make this trip a lot The Saturn would have been a better choice for me as I have rented this model quite often It is not not_as not_though not_I not_am not_hard not_to not_fit not_into not_a not_car not_I not_am not_5 not_5 not_weigh not_115 not_pounds not_and not_I not_am not_usually not_quite not_comfortable not_in not_most not_any not_car not_But not_the not_Taurus not_seemed not_especially not_uncomfortable not_For not_anyone not_who not_is not_thinking not_of not_renting not_a not_car not_for not_a not_long not_trip not_I not_would not_suggest not_that not_the not_Ford not_Taurus not_1999 not_not not_be not_on not_the not_list not_of not_be not_sure not_to not_get not_this not_There not_was not_a not_large not_trunk not_that not_allowed not_us not_to not_pack not_a not_lot not_of not_materials not_needed not_for not_the not_business not_end not_of not_the not_trip not_Driving not_it not_was not_a not_breeze not_and not_everything not_worked not_right not_I not_have not_no not_complaints not_about not_the not_standard not_making not_of not_the not_car not_except not_in not_the not_comfort not_area
Neg,This took about four days to fix Next the clean air pump broke again within a week The first problem was the valve covers were leaking This problem took three days in the shop This also took nearly a week to fix Cause of this problem was unknown This is not not_even not_close not_to not_being not_all not_of not_the not_problems but I think ive said enough The gas mileage at this point is about 10mpg never increasing the belt replacement continued till the present date at a belt every month This did not not_help not_the not_situation not_Within not_two not_weeks not_the not_serpentine not_belt not_was not_replaced not_for not_the not_second not_time not_since not_I not_bought not_the not_vehicle The truck went into the shop again for transmission leaks to a ford dealership where the problems found mounted Once again unavailable and discontinued parts This repair took about 5 days Truck vibrates at about 70 miles an hour so we spent 1700 on a new front end tires balancing etc When I picked up the truck after the air pump I didnt not_realize not_at not_the not_time not_that not_the not_mechanic not_had not_not not_hooked not_back not_up not_a not_hose not_to not_the not_transmission So after driving it for three days my transmission needed to be rebuilt Due to unavailable parts a new transmission replaced the old Which was mated to a junk yard transfer case When we went to pick it up we found that the mechanic at the dealership did not not_replace not_parts not_that not_he not_had not_to not_take not_off My husband and I purchased a 1990 Ford F250 and had nothing but problems we have owned the vehicle approximately two years and it has spent at least half of that time in the shop This took an additional week Because of the poor design fixing this vehicle was not not_found not_to not_be not_cheap nor could just any mechanic do the work Next within one week the serpentine belt came off the pulleys and sheared off the air conditioning power plug The truck had 98 000 miles when I took over so I expected some problems dont not_get not_me not_wrong but newer vehicles are said too have 200 000 mile motors I noticed a large loss of power after said repairs then began the costly fixes and diagnostics to find cause of power loss
Neg,The ignition is hidden and difficult to find My friends refuse to be a passenger in the back Never taken off road Never towed anything of significant weight and Never used inappropriately The rear bench seating is hard very uncomfortable General Motors seems to have very comfortable and roomy seating in their comparable models This is information regarding my vehicle and the excessive amount of problems found during an inspection 15 Sept 2003 The metal cant not_hold not_up and appears thin for the bed I do like the exterior look of the F150 I feel I have a thorough opinion of this truck compared to most who post evaluations of their vehicles If I did not not_have not_the not_extended not_warranty not_I not_could not_only not_guess not_the not_bill not_to not_pay not_for not_this not_The not_extended not_cab not_seating not_is not_extremely not_cramped They make their money on repairs and maintenance very expensive im not not_complaining not_about not_this but you buy and expensive truck expect to pay for the maintenance My truck has been owned by me since new and currently have 75 k miles ive been meticulous with maintenance and treating my truck with normal duty activities never exceeding the manufacturers recommendations The stereo is second class for sound and tuning stations especially AM Factory installed tires have no significant grip traction after 10 000 miles I recommend getting a spray in liner to help prevent the large dents and scratches that have happened in my truck but not not_trucks not_that not_have not_been not_sprayed Its reference for anyone else who has had the same problems or looking for information regarding warranties and extended warranties You are welcome to give some feedback VEHICLE 2000 FORD F150 5 4L 4x4 XLT w Off Road Tow Package 17 Rims Everything factory install all the top options included EXTENDED WARRANTY Purchased FORDs version 75 K mile Bumper to Bumper coverage when new 50 deductible per drive in occurrence DRIVING CONDITIONS All items above were replaced under the purchased extended warranty bumber to bumber plan EXCEPT a kit for the module assembly on the ABS I will dispute that today but had to pay for it to get it done I am shocked that this much damage was found for a vehicle at only 75 k miles proclaimed to be Built Ford Tough yet only offering a 36 K mile manufacturer warranty Toward the last 400 miles of my 75 K mile Ford purchased extended warranty bumper to bumper plan the passenger side power door lock failed and the ABS light turned on I brought it in to the dealer for an inspection along with some squeeking of the front end thought it was a tire rim leak PROBLEMS FOUND 1 All 4 tie rods inners and outers bad 2 Lower ball joints bad 3 ABS Codes C1095 and C1096 ECU and HCU Controller and Module Assembly bad 4 Passenger side door lock actuator bad 5 Power Steering Pump bad air conditioning warranty replaced back at 30 k miles The height is fantastic I can see all around while driving it certainly upsets small vehicle drivers behind me tailgating me and assuming im a slow road hog in the left lane but when trying to pass they see the road jammed full of cars in front of me bumper to bumper Accelerations and towing torque are very good Although now I sense a loss or hesitation on a occasions when I have to suddenly put the petal to the medal to avoid accidents Expect to pay the value of your truck in maintenance costs from the dealer
Neg,In addition The engine lights continues to go on to this day Anyone who enjoys sports cars fast vehicles should avoid this car It does so in a roomy way as well I like the way the Windstar handles As the minivan is only one of a handful of vehicles that have the room my family requires The suspension on the Windstar leaves something to be desired I have the privledge of feeling every bump It is easy to steer and control much like driving a car Some vans have steering that is difficult This makes it difficult if not not_impossible not_for not_me not_to not_feel not_safe not_in not_the not_Windstar not_Thankfully not_my not_husband not_is not_quite not_mechanical not_The not_Windstar not_handles not_well AS a mother of 3 all of whom are still in carseats the only logical thing to do was to trade in my 200sx for a minivan The brakes are sound I have yet to have them fail or squeak severly People who should buy this vehicle are those with alot of children or who need to transport alot of things We bought a new one so the mechanical difficulties would be minimum I love the fact that the van seats so many people I never have to worry about bringing 2 cars Even if I have me kids with me the van seats added passengers It has great acceleration I like the fact that you are able to see way infront of you while driving But these features are almost always indicative of all vans or at least most of them I hate the fact that this vehicle has broken down 4 times leaving myself and my children STRANDED on the side of the road Each time we brought it back to the dealer where they said they fixed it Each diagnosis was different
Neg,The side passenger window creates a blind spot which I think is dangerous It actually feels like the car is going to tip over in some turns The Ford Winstar is a car that I would not not_recommend not_purchasing not_I not_have not_driven not_this not_van not_several not_times and I cant not_get not_used not_to not_it not_The not_handling not_is not_horrible not_do not_to not_its not_swaying not_feeling Where the side window meets the windshield is where I think the problem is When braking it also feels like the driver doesnt have control do to the car having a difficult time stopping quick This car doesnt stop efficiently it doesnt handle well and it also doesnt provide the driver with a very good frame of vision on the passenger side I feel that this is a safety hazard not not_only to the driver and their passengers but also to everyone else on the road Not recommended by me
Neg,The interior lights stayed on all the time as well We never did have any problems with the air or heat It was the GL model and had rear heat air and stereo controls The air conditioning would literally run you out it got so cold We had heard nothing but good about this van its safety ratings ease of driving etc There was plenty of room for 7 and rode extremely nice even in the very back We replaced the tranny and a few weeks later the interior of the sliding door fell off The front seats were bucket while the two in back were bench Everything about it was wonderful UNTIL The door ajar light was always on no matter what was done to ensure that all the doors were closed It had constant problems with the ignition switch and was always dinging whether or not not_the not_keys were in it the lights were on whatever We had around 70 000 miles on it and the transmission went out of it Things seemed to roll downhill from there No lie a few times this van even started itself when the keys werent even in it The gas mileage was only about 17 18 mpg We bought this van in 1999 after having been a rental since its birth Initially we loved it It was everything we had dreamed about and more It rode very nice and drove very nice but all in all Id say it definately wasnt not_worth not_the not_money not_paid and was more of a headache than it was worth
Neg,The windshield wiper is still the best on the market The ride is smooth and quiet and it handles quite well If the leak cannot not_be not_fixed I ll look for another car The sun visors are almost useless as they do not not_go not_all not_the not_way not_forward I bought the Focus wagon for its cargo space Its great for camping and the hardware store It has a solid feel compared to our Lancer I wish the gas mileage were a little better This is a bummer if you are expecting cool air in the spring or fall to come through The other issue I have is that the vent allows too much engine heat through in the summertime It does have nice features like an adjustable seat belt height in the front seat big door pockets seat warmers They sag too low and block too much of the road I went from a Ford Escort wagon to this car The Focus feels like a luxury car compared to the Escort I will give this car a chance The biggest problem I have is that it leaks terribly in the back I plan to take it in to get that fixed I have had to clean the trunk carpet twice with a bleach solution to kill the mold mildew that has set in
Neg,They probably will be the owners of tiny vehicles frightened by the Excursion There will be some who complain Excursion is too big In my test drive the Excursion never grabbed another vehicle and slung it from my path It should already be here but it will be offered on Excursion hopefully soon It took a 310 horsepower V 10 to maneuver the 19 foot Excursion over winding roads with minimal strain However once in the third row you are directly over the rear axle putting you in touch with all the road harshness But dont not_expect not_to not_take not_a not_tight not_corner not_with not_ease not_as not_you not_would not_in not_say not_an not_Explorer The steering offers low effort movement to balance out the size and weight without being so loose you dont not_feel not_in not_control The suspension has a tendency to be firm but has been adjusted to prevent bone jarring movement on uneven pavement Handling is surprisingly pleasant Other features include a full size spare inside along the side wall that still allows a decent amount of room and folding second and third seats increase cargo capacity Once the boat was unhooked the V 10 managed twisty hilly roads without coming up for air But even without a boat Excursion isnt not_going not_to not_run not_from not_the not_light With boat attached the V 10 performed admirably which after all is why Excursion exists to provide those who need to tow big heavy things a big heavy vehicle The Excursion isnt not_a not_utility not_vehicle not_meant not_to not_haul not_large not_families not_and not_large not_things not_that not_smaller not_vehicles not_cant not_Only not_about not_50 not_000 not_will not_be not_built not_the not_first not_year not_Excursions not_strong not_point not_its not_huge not_size not_is not_also not_drawing not_criticism Not sure if the base 5 4 liter 255 h p would have fared as well Ford estimates that the 5 4 liter will deliver 10 to 11 mpg city highway the 6 8 liter 15 to 16 mpg and the 7 3 liter turbo diesel 17 to 18 mpg And the turning radius is well lets just say you ll need three to four lanes for a U turn Excursion comes with four wheel anti lock disk brakes Even with normal braking be sure to apply the pedal earlier to account for its size If you have kids you might want to wait for it Dual air bags are standard with Belt Minder which sounds a chime every 30 seconds as a reminder to buckle up The Excursion is offered at a starting price of 33 460 for 2WD and 36 775 for 4WD It stands so tall I lost sight of a BMW Z 3 that pulled up behind me at the light which means objects such as pets or kids that are even smaller wont be seen when you back out of the driveway Ford offers a sonar reverse sensing system on the Windstar mini van that beeps to warn of objects when backing up You ve probably heard about the giant 2000 Ford Excursion sport utility vehicle which carries a significant price tag which relates to its size According to safety experts when you spot the Excursion on the road pull off the asphalt after having wet your pants in fear and hide in the gutter to avoid any chance of making contact with a machine so big it feasts on coupes for snacks and sedans for entrees The third seat is on rollers so it can be removed or folded against the back of the second seat for more cargo room and it contains tons of room behind the third seat for luggage or golf clubs without removing it Other goodies include 10 cup holders 5 power plugs 4 coat hooks second and third row reading lamps rear cabin audio controls with dual headphone jacks overhead console for garage door opener and eyeglass holders Despite excellent glass hatch visibility theres one glaring problem in back on Excursion In back the standard trailer hitch and associated hardware was designed to sit low to keep vehicles from submarining under Excursion in a rear end impact Excursion is garageable if the garage is at least 20 feet deep and the door at least 7 feet high Inside Excursion has three rows of seats to handle eight passengers nine if you decide to go for a front bench seat rather than a massive center section with a writing top 4 cup holders for front and rear passengers and enough room inside for tape CD coin holders plus the optional six CD changer Entry to the third seat is easy Press the handle and the second seat back lowers and the bottom slides forward for wide open entry exit in back
Neg,This vehicle dwarfs even the biggest of all SUVs But the handling the handling is TERRIBLE It is comfortable and there enough space even in the way back There is plenty of chrome to make it glitzy enough Its big The tailgate is gigantic with two doors that swing wide out to the sides If you thought that the GMC Chevrolet Suburban was big wait till you see the 2000 Ford Excursion The vehicle is powerful enough for passing effectively on the highways and is comparable to the Suburban in accleration Its a truck its a truck disguised as a SUV Its hard to maneuver and the turning radius is horrible The step in height is high even for a tall individual and it takes quite some effort to get in The Limited version has a leather and wood interior and seating for up to nine although most cars are outfitted for seven on eight people And in the race for the biggest and the baddest SUVs Ford takes the cake Outside the vehicle closely resembles the Ford F350 with its front and grill Once inside you will be lucky if you can get inside you will notice an abundance of space but its not not_much not_more than the smaller Suburban Its comfortable but again a Dodge Caravan is just as nice in the inside as my opinion If you are in the market for a vehicle with a lot of room and with all wheel drive that can handle in the snow a much better choice than the Excursion is the Dodge Caravan with all wheel drive Its better on your wallet too with a better price and its much better gas mileage
Neg,The truck rides nicely for its size The exterior styling is very nice rough and rugged The feel is very firm considering how large it is In the hands of the right buyer this truck is great If you re paying over 36 K for this thing you deserve a little more exclusivisity The taillings are a little too similar to the econoline vans but thats okay I suppose This vehicle also inspires a sense of false security and superiority in the event of a collision People just simply think The interior was done very nicely in leather trim but I didnt not_at not_all not_like not_how not_its not_simply not_kind not_of not_a not_dressed not_up not_Ford not_super not_duty not_truck not_interior Id imagine parking this thing is a nightmare in tight urban spaces a parallel park might require one of those guys at the airport that guide the planes in with lighted torches The thing thats most frightening about this truck is that people who buy it in the city tend to be the type that chat away on cell phones all of the time that habit combined with the desructive potential of this thing can and will lead to many tragedies If I crash the other guy will die haha that might be true but you ll pay later aside from the legal consequences depending on if it was your fault you will have to live with the fact that because of the vehicle choice you made you may have cripple injured or possibly even killed someone out there You d think that the problem of teh wrong type of buyer getting this thing would be solved by the high gasoline prices but that doesnt seem to be the case perhaps if we see prices over 2 50 per gallon Bottom line Ford made a good truck here but it cant not_play not_big not_brother not_to not_control not_who not_buys not_people not_really not_need not_to not_become not_aware not_of not_the not_fact not_that not_SUVs not_do not_have not_dangers not_associted not_with not_them not_i not_e not_rollovers not_are not_more not_common not_and not_make not_better not_choices My friend lives in a rural area and is involved in shipping large equipment on trailers so its the right kind of truck for him However I think people that simply buy this thing to use as a status symbol are pretty shallow and basically stupid I dont not_see not_the not_logic not_is not_sayign not_you not_ve not_got not_the not_biggest not_and not_baddest not_truck not_out not_there not_when not_you not_have not_to not_pay not_over not_60 not_to not_fill not_er not_up not_and not_use not_it not_to not_do not_things not_like not_go not_to not_the not_mall not_and not_take not_drive not_to not_work not_in not_alone not_while not_burning not_gasoline not_galore not_in not_gridlock I went for a test drive in a 2000 Excursion with the Eddie Bauer trim package with a friend who is looking to buy an SUV pretty soon ive always owned coupes and just one sedan in my lifetime so this was very different for me when i got behind the wheel so he cound ride in the back and check it out I has a mix of feelings I did feel like I was in tank or something because I was ridding high and felt the sheer magnitude of the truck as being something that was confidence inspiring However I didnt not_feel not_like not_I not_ws not_in not_control not_of not_the not_vehicle not_Stoppng not_disances not_were not_super not_long not_and not_if not_something not_or not_someone not_happen not_to not_dart not_out not_in not_front not_of not_the not_truck not_there not_was not_no not_way not_to not_safely not_swerve not_and not_aviod not_a not_most not_likely not_fatal not_collion not_with not_the not_victim
Neg,This segment added later They want a sense of security and safety They dont not_have not_to not_even not_conform not_with not_EPA not_regulations It appears as though Ford is FINALLY coming to terms on its SUV line The automakers just last month publicly recognized this fact and are making steps to prevent deaths And by stating that is it a LEV low emission vehicle must be a comparison to a coal burning power plant They have an Excursion full of arguing kids they have an added distraction of a cell phone and other stuff All I know is there is one more company to add to my DO NOT BUY STOCK list It only got 7 miles per gallon I not not_once not_complained not_about not_it not_What not_irritates not_me not_is not_the not_people not_whining not_about not_fuel not_prices not_who not_do not_drive not_these not_vehicles This is the first step in dropping the line all together Any guesses on the value of the Excursion you just bought when that happens Maybe William Ford Jr read my Epinion and decided to take action When ever there is something on the news about gas prices there is ALWAYS someone griping but has a big ole truck My BIG issue is the safety issue Clearly these trucks are dangerous to other cars There is no way you can burn so much fuel and produce as much pollution as a Honda come on The Excursions gas mileage doesnt even bother me that much Heck not not_too not_long ago I owned a 1974 Cadillac HEARSE yes it had dead people in it at one time Why couldnt they have done this earlier I could care less if a stupid person kills them self in any vehicle but when they kill someone else that really bothers me Especially so when they purchase a vehicle that they are not not_capable not_of not_driving not_unfortunately not_this is many times soccer moms

their SUVs were not not_as not_safe and environmentally friendly as they should be and will take steps to make them safer for the occupants other drivers and the environment Another interesting twist Ford JUST THIS WEEK decided to reduce production of Excursion by 25 That is not not_a not_small not_percentage not_I not_saw not_this not_happening not_long not_ago We ve been spoiled by cheap gas that the automakers dont not_market not_fuel not_efficient not_vehicles not_here but yet you can buy several cars that get 50 mpg in Europe Even the Suburban which is still not not_great not_claims

Neg,The excursion is intimidating and maybe thats whats appealing to some people If you have to cart around ten people and a boat and luggage and some furniture all at once by all means get this truck One day I was in a parkinglot behind one and I sat mezermerized as big truck tried to fit into a rather wide space These cars are apt to roll over cant not_stop quickly and the blind spots are tremendous I have seen the most amazing sights concerning the Excursion Hey everybody I dont not_own not_this not_car not_I not_havent not_ever not_driven not_this not_car But I do have opinions about it and I might as well share them The power is appealing the size is apalling buying this truck makes you responsible for driving in a whole new way If you need an Excursion surely go buy one But please keep in mind that not not_everyone on the road is in a Big Truck and that we have rights as well Just dont not_buy not_this not_truck not_without not_a not_lot not_of not_heavy not_thought And I love trucks I wanted a truck before I got my car and maybe someday I ll get one anyway im not not_in not_any not_way not_implying not_that not_theres not_any not_reason not_not not_to not_make not_trucks Id like to start a discussion about these mammoth SUVs so that they dont not_just not_keep not_getting not_bigger not_and not_bigger not_so not_that not_eventually not_cars not_and not_trucks not_can not_be not_of not_compatible not_sizes not_and not_not not_create not_major not_problems not_for not_each not_other not_just not_by not_sharing not_a not_road My car is a Saturn SL1 go read my review a car that is constantly subjected to being blinded at night by SUVs and trucks coming up behind us This is an annoying problem maybe one that Saturn should address but still something of a concern It took more than seven adjustments back out pull in back out for Big Truck to park crookedly and there was absolutely no room for me to squeeze by Then another day in another parking lot I saw a ten year old kid try to hop up into the passengers side of the truck If one is near me on the highway I want to get away from it I do not not_believe not_they not_can not_see not_me not_in not_my not_smaller not_car not_and not_I not_dont not_want not_to not_get not_crushed not_I not_ll not_do not_whatever not_I not_can not_to not_avoid not_an not_Excursion not_and not_im not_no not_meek not_flower not_of not_a not_driver But the Excursion named Big Truck by some of my friends is simply too big If you live where I live you just dont not_need not_this not_vehicle not_most not_likely and you re endangering all of us by just driving it Id like to know why half of the parents in my town bought their Excursions whether it was for safety or trendiness or because minivans just arent cool anymore He missed the seat and fell right onto the ground I dont not_doubt not_that not_this not_happens not_all not_the not_time not_I not_had not_a not_hard not_time not_not not_thinking not_about not_my not_tiny not_grandmother not_trying not_to not_get not_into not_this not_tremendous not_truck not_A not_simple not_footstool not_like not_the not_one not_she not_uses not_to not_get not_into not_our not_Plymouth not_Voyager not_wouldnt not_be not_enough not_to not_even not_reach not_the not_Excursions not_step not_Big not_Truck not_is not_much not_too not_big not_Please not_Excursion not_lovers not_dont not_hunt not_me not_down not_to not_run not_me not_over not_with not_your not_truck im not not_trying not_to not_take not_away not_anyones not_fun not_or not_anyones not_vehicle not_I not_just not_wish not_that not_people not_would not_think not_a not_lot not_harder not_before not_buying not_into not_the not_Excursion not_club
Neg,They recommend lowering the tire pressure to below recommended levels I bought this vehicle to have a safe vehicle to transport my three young children on the California freeways We have had and been extremely satisfied with the Ford Lynx Sable Explorer Bronco and Expedition I would not not_AT not_ALL not_recommend not_the not_excursion not_to not_anyone This information is in the autos Technical Service Bulletin available at the dealer of purchase Ford is aware of this problem and has no answer for it The dealer has informed us that this car really maintains control only when it is filled to capacity with adults and is towing a heavy load My excursion is a 2 wheel drive V10 I have had two major problems with this vehicle 1 The back end of the vehicle bounces from side to side whenever driving over a drain or small pothole in the road I nearly lost control of the car driving on the 15 freeway at 55 MPH Ford has test driven the vehicle acknowledged the problem and has refused to take the vehicle back I think it is because they are nervous about receiving all of their vehicles back Any 2 wheel drivers experiencing the same problem A test driver from the Dispute Settlement Board has driven the vehicle and another like vehicle and found the same problem I am hoping that the board rules that Ford take the excursion back 2 All California excursions have a flutter noise that sounds like five holes in the exhaust
Neg,It is a monster but is it really worth the extra room So it is the new fad for mothers to drive Expeditions Suburbans Land Cruisers and now Excursions ok maybe it isnt not_a not_NEW not_fad not_The not_Ford not_Death not_Trap not_Excursion not_is not_exactly not_how not_it not_sounds When driving the Excursion you will not not_be not_worried not_about not_your not_own not_safety but those around you instead Make sure you can handle the ridiculous size before you join in on the large SUV fad Oh yeah and good luck finding a parking spot The extra insecurities are simply not not_worth not_its not_size not_Whatever not_happened not_to not_the not_mini not_van not_Its not_roomier not_more not_comfortable not_and not_more not_efficient but it just doesnt seem to be in style anymore Until then I believe every soccer mom feels its necessary to have a 4wd Expedition Suburban or Excursion This thing is an incredible undertaking to drive you must be constantly aware of everything around you The truck barely fits within its allotted space on the right side of the road Built off of the frame of the F 250 truck the Excursion has not not_particularly not_crash not_tested well either I test drove one of these while helping a friends family pick out a car I must say that I cannot not_recommend not_it not_No not_pickup not_not not_that not_any not_is not_needed not_and not_terrible not_turning not_radius
Neg,The vehicle is over 7 feet tall and wider than most parking spaces Now im no granola munchin hippie but this beast of a car is a hazard to the environment and everyone else on the road While it may be roomy can easily fit 9 people this means that the SUV must weigh 9 tons All of this excess means one thing if you are involved in a accident with one of these you will probably be killed Its like going up against a monster truck Dont let Ford fool you either these cars SUVs in general do not not_have not_any not_emissions not_standards not_so not_basically not_these not_things not_pollute not_as not_much not_a not_big not_rig not_With not_the not_surge not_in not_the not_popularity not_of not_these not_things not_that not_means not_that not_the not_earth not_is not_becoming not_polluted not_at not_an not_even not_more not_alarming not_rate So maybe the environment or the hazards to everyone else dont not_phase not_you not_You not_have not_your not_mind not_set not_on not_one not_of not_these not_babies not_Just not_check not_out not_the not_price and the gas mileage these things get If you live in CT like me then the price of gas alone equals the price of the car in a few years if you drive at least 40 miles a day All of these things means that this excess room is just costing everyone else including the owner If its room you want then get an RV or a van Just not not_a not_stupid not_ugly not_SUV

Neg,It is very dependable and comfortable We looked at quite a few brands The air conditioning and heating works well The front passenger door has some problems also The engine works wonderful Not a squeak or grind anywhere It even has a windshield wiper on the back window The latch to close the door started sticking also about a month ago At the time I was driving an old Volkswagon Bug and I had two children already That is something I never had on any of my previous vehicles When we saw the Aerostar on the lot my husband wanted it right then Our big search for a larger vehicle started when I found out I was expecting another child We had looked at drove and researched over a dozen before thinking about narrowing down our options In about a month after that the screws started falling out of the door and the panel was loose The only one I didnt not_feel not_comfortable not_with was Fords I had heard a lot of negative feedback on those cars My mind definitely changed within the 6 months we have owned this vehicle Within a month the door started having trouble closing It was clean and comfortable with a sporty look I wanted to look a little more I researched it online to make sure we were getting a good deal When the dealer lowered his price to what I felt was an awesome deal we decided to buy it For not not_wanting not_a not_Ford not_to not_begin not_with not_I not_would not_have not_to not_say not_that not_this not_vehicle not_has not_been not_one not_of not_the not_best not_we not_have not_owned The panel started falling out there as well Though I have a lot of children we do no more wear and tear on this vehicle than a mini van should be able to stand up to since it is made to carry children I dont not_feel not_we not_are not_overly not_hard not_on not_it Yet the van keeps falling apart at an unbelievable pace I will stick with my gut instincts next time and stay away from Ford vehicles Though it is compacted into a small place I am sure it wouldnt not_be not_that not_hard not_to not_fix not_if not_something not_did not_go not_wrong not_I not_dont not_know not_much not_about not_the not_specifics not_of not_the not_engine not_but not_it not_will not_change not_from not_car not_to not_car not_so not_the not_specifics not_arent not_as not_important not_here not_as not_the not_quality not_Recently not_we not_took not_out not_the not_back not_seat not_and not_went not_shopping not_for not_a not_very not_large not_toolbox not_for not_my not_husbands not_work not_I not_couldnt not_believe not_we not_fit not_it not_in not_there not_with not_one not_of not_the not_back not_seats not_still not_in not_I not_guess not_we not_dont not_need not_a not_truck not_after not_all not_UPDATED not_11 not_24 not_00
Neg,So to the shop it went We bought a 1994 van used in 1996 But our problems began within two weeks of purchase We received many many complements and offers of purchase over the past few years It was repaired again and lasted until the end of 1999 We fell in love with the beautiful conversion package it was very unique This van was babied the whole time we had it so we do not not_understand not_why not_all not_the not_problems In 1999 the ABS system went the rear end started going out the air bag went out and the transmission was slipping The ABS system went out so we took it to be repaired and within the next two months it was out again We knew people with older Ford vans who had 200 00 plus miles and not not_a not_bit of trouble ours finally had hit 100 000 and was going out of commission We have now traded our Ford for a Mercury Villager and absolutely love it The Ford was nice for show but that was about it I will miss it but now I dont not_have not_to not_fight not_the not_wind not_put not_up not_with not_a not_slipping not_transmission not_or not_worry not_about not_my not_airbags not_deploying not_when not_needed
Neg,We bought a 97 Ford Ranger Extended Cab 4x4 because of its low price If you can live without a four wheel drive then the low cost factor of the Ranger may outweigh this consideration But if you re into off roading or just need to plow through winter snows dont not_buy not_the not_Ranger not_4x4 The mechanic told us that Ford is notorious for these hub problems a result of poor engineering of their shift on the fly 4x4 mechanism And granted its a smooth ride an attractive vehicle and the engine has started even on the coldest of mornings But We live in the mountains and a four wheel drive vehicle is a must After just two years the hubs on our Ranger went out and cost us over 800 in repairs
Neg,The performance during the first year of use was near perfect But the most common problem that has appeared in EVERY The exterior was flawless shiny eye appealing and had lots of showoff value True enough when first purchased these trucks looked great and were great to drive The standard transmissions all are failing miserably and the truck is often in the shop being repaired But now time has passed and several years down the road and lt 100 000 miles later their tune has changed drastically The trucks can NEVER be trusted to go into first gear and leap forward with any amount of speed safely And of course the owner was very proud to show off that new truck to his fellow hunters fishermen farmers and offered everyone and their brother free rides The universal joints are going out wrecking havoc in the life of the offshore worker who must be at work on time or face loosing a weeks paycheck Ford truck that they have own is the sudden stalling out in traffic Push the gas pedal and the truck just stalls out and dies rather than go forward My advice is to talk with long time Ford truck owners and way the pros and cons heavily before buying a truck that you expect to perform for many years to come All the trucks have lost their luster the paint is peeling off numerous rust spots all over the cabs roofs and around the wheel covers and the owners are frustrated and certainly dont not_have not_the not_money not_to not_have not_a not_new not_paint not_job For generations the men in my family have insisted on purchasing Ford trucks and usually buy the F 150 series Sometimes the trucks where loaded with extras but most of the time they bought just a plain unusual pickup truck with standard transmission power brakes and power steering and what they thought to be a good solid engine and transmission
Neg,The radiator had to be replaced at 5 K miles and the transmission was leaking fluid like crazy too Also we had to call the CEO of our local dealer because their service center said that the factory warranty wouldnt not_cover not_the not_cost I thought it was odd that the front and back brakes as well as the rotors all went out before hitting 20 K miles It is a comfy truck with a lot of room looks good but the reason I wont buy another is simply because of the service the crappy way we were treated We owned a 1997 F 150 Offroad prior to this one and like this truck the window mechanism on the passenger side tends to go out early on This truck has been in the shop 3 or 4 times since we ve had it not not_quite not_1 year old just the deal with the brakes sucked The repair bill was 550 00 but the CEO saw it our way after much arguing and we didnt not_have not_to not_pay not_it not_I not_guess not_they not_didnt not_like not_us not_too not_much not_because not_when not_we not_picked not_up not_the not_truck not_there not_was not_bird not_poop not_all not_over not_the not_inside not_of not_the not_truck not_and not_it not_had not_a not_flat not_tire
Neg,The police package was the only Crown Vic in 1991 with a carburetor Not only was it a carburetor but an engineering nightmare known as a variable venturi The sticker price isnt not_even not_close not_to not_what not_it not_will not_cost not_in not_the not_end If you re looking for an inexpensive luxury car dont not_stop not_off not_at not_the not_local not_used not_police not_car not_salesman The acceleration was awesome but at less then 20 miles per gallon stepping on the gas was an expensive proposition When the car was running it was a lot of fun Good acceleration lots of luxury features that the Honda didnt not_have and interesting responses from other drivers Unfortunately the bad outweighed the good I was driving a 1987 Honda CRX that was about to die and needed something quickly so I hit a dealer specializing in used police cars figuring Id get something inexpensive and interesting I picked up a 1991 police package formerly owned by the Connecticut state police Since the car was only going to be driven a few hundred miles a week price was the main concern The one I had was going bad The local Ford dealer wouldnt not_touch not_it not_saying not_that not_the not_best not_that not_they not_could not_do not_was not_replace not_it not_at not_a not_cost not_of not_1100 not_I not_did not_manage not_to not_find not_a not_mechanic not_who not_specialized not_in not_them not_and not_only not_charged not_500 not_to not_rebuild not_the not_one not_I not_had not_Eventually not_all not_of not_the not_major not_systems not_on not_the not_car not_were not_replaced not_one not_at not_a not_time not_just not_to not_keep not_the not_car not_operating not_When not_it not_was not_running not_the not_handling not_wasnt not_particularly not_good not_the not_breaking not_was not_poor not_and not_the not_ride not_was not_soft not_I not_cant not_even not_imagine not_what not_a not_standard not_Crown not_Vic not_would not_drive not_like
Neg,Boy was I ever wrong Id end up paying This car seemed perfect in every sense for what I wanted and needed So I was limited to driving it around in the parking lot of the dealership To my surprise the steering seemed unusually oversensitive and the car seemed to ride very awkwardly around bends The only problem was that I wasnt not_able not_to not_test not_drive not_it not_on not_the not_road not_because not_it not_hadnt not_been not_properly not_prepped It seemed fine in the lot but the lot and a road are two different dimensions when it comes to testing a cars handling The dealer who specializes only in used police cars was highly recommended by a friend of mine who has bought three cars from him and has been very satisfied with the cars overall The dealer reassured me that that was typical of the Crown Vics and it was possible that the car just needed an alignment I figured that Id just have to get used to the different handling The day I picked up my Crown Vic it had been completely checked over and prepped by the dealer I was eager to take it for a spin on the open road to see how it handled before handing over the check One owner of the same year and version of my car responded to a message for help I posted on a used police car bulletin board and he suggested having the alignment done by a mechanic that is familiar with the special needs of a police package vehicle He said that having the alignment done properly on his Crown Vic improved the handling enough so that he decided to hang on to it I will update this review as soon as I have the alignment done on my car in the next week or so So I handed over the check and drove home with the my new used Crown Vic A few days later I took it in to my trusted local mechanic to have it looked over with special attention to the steerings oversensitivity problem and my mechanic said everything seemed to have checked out okay So after two trips up to the dealer and looking at dozens of cars on the lot I settled on a 96 Crown Vic police intercepter model with 95 000 miles on it and a rebuilt transmission Part of the catch was the price which was several thousand dollars less than I thought You may say that I should ve known better but I figured that a car with a police package was supposed to handle well Before making the final decision on the Crown Vic the dealer suggested that I test drive a 95 Caprice police car he just prepped for a sale latter that day He mentioned that the Caprices handle better than the Crown Vics I took the Caprice for a spin and the handling seemed nice and the engine was amazing But I had my heart set on the Crown Vic ive just always liked the look of it much better and figured that there would be little difference in handling between the Caprice and the Crown Vic because after all both cars had police packages I just bought a used 1996 Crown Victoria Police Interceptor and am not not_a not_very not_happy not_camper not_I not_belong not_to not_a not_volunteer not_highway not_safety not_organization and was in the market for a new used police car as my 93 Ford Taurus was on its last legs After spending several weeks searching all over trying to find a used Crown Vic police car to my liking and that did not not_break not_the not_bank not_I not_finally not_found not_one not_at not_a not_dealer not_located not_two not_hours not_away not_from not_my not_home So to end on a little bit of a positive note there still may be hope for this Crown Vic and me But I dont not_have not_a not_lot not_of not_free not_time not_in not_my not_life not_to not_devote not_to not_fine not_tuning not_a not_car not_to not_ride not_decently not_that not_should not_have not_been not_built not_that not_way not_to not_begin not_with not_I not_will not_be

not_driving not_limited not_to not_the not_parking not_lot ps My advise to anyone considering purchasing a used Crown Vic police car or for that matter any used car is to test drive it thoroughly and see if you can live with its handling I ll have to try to learn to live with the Crown Vics handling unless I choose to sell it which im not not_quite not_ready not_to not_do not_yet not_The not_reason not_being not_that not_in not_the not_last not_24 not_hours not_I not_found not_some not_useful not_forums not_and not_sites not_on not_the not_internet not_that not_discuss not_problems not_with not_the not_Crown not_Vic not_police not_packages not_and not_some not_suggestions not_on not_correcting not_them He couldnt find anything really wrong with the vehicle that might cause steering or handling problems and he came to the same conclusion as the dealer that Crown Vics were just built that way Well now I feel kind of confused and upset because I had expected the Crown Vic especially the police package to handle much more nimbly overall My 93 Ford Taurus with 140 000 miles on it shot front shocks a ball joint and tie rod about to go and power steering that gave out long ago still handled better for the most part than this Crown Vic In a way I wish I had gotten the Caprice but I didnt not_know not_better not_at not_the not_time
Neg,All ergonomics are well placed and simple The Crown Victoria is a breed thats siblings are dying fast The underpowered v 6 whines when the gas pedal is pushed But firm enough to support your grandmas Aching Hips Where it lacks in perofrmance it is justified by the comfort and roominess This car is designed for the grandma that hates All Those Gadgets Its forward bench seat is comfortable and squishy If you are still in your prime years I would stay away from this car unless you like the bulky fleet car look The only major competetors in its category is the Lincoln Town Car and the Ill fated Chevrolet Caprice Classic Its twin the Mercury Gran Marquis shares many of the same characteristics as the crown vic Acceleration is very sluggish for a car of its heft
Neg,Whats worse though was the lousy 9 mpg I got You see it didnt not_like not_warm not_weather not_for not_some not_reason It was terribly expensive to drive to insure and to keep up Too bad too it was so beautiful It was absolutely beautiful I purchased it with the intention of enjoying it while traveling to Florida from Ohio Never did make it though I purchased a used 1992 high top with all the toys t v vcr nintendo remotes queen size fold down bed built in oak cabinets built in coolers all the goodies of the tiarra package The service men at 3 shops that day told me they could find no reason whatsoever for the things not not_being not_perfectly not_normal because it showed power going to all areas as if totally normal It stalled every single time the temperature outside reached 73 or higher I would have to pull over to the side of the road and wait about 20 min then go on my way again for another hour or so before it would stall again I had it to 4 shops which all said it was fine and no Ford dealer within miles believed a word I said I replaced computer components 2x over 3000 of my own money and the problem never went away I replaced brakes on it as often as I changed the oil I wanted badly to sell the van but felt aweful at the idea of someone else getting as stuck with it as I was I finally traded it in for a new Dodge van and the day I did everything in it shorted out The t v wouldnt not_work not_the not_vcr not_wouldnt not_work not_the not_seats not_wouldnt not_move and yet all the fuses were tested and checked out to be fine
Neg,This is a factory related defect confirmed by internal service bulletin 93 8 4 Microchecking sent to dealers in April 1993 and covered under your Owner Dialog program to date nothing has been resolved I have written numerous letters to no avail All I can say is if you are looking at Ford products caveat emptor If you have a 1992 Ford Econoline van and bought the vehicle used as I did you will find that the dealer or the factory will not not_be not_of not_any not_assistance not_to not_you not_if not_you not_find not_that not_the not_paint not_on not_the not_horizontal not_surfaces not_is not_falling not_off not_I not_purchased not_the not_vehicle not_in not_1994 not_and not_within not_a not_year not_the not_paint not_started not_to not_delaminate not_from not_the not_body and even though there was a secret recall

Neg,I purchased my 1990 Ford Taurus GL Wagon in 1990 So far I have spent approximately 8 000 on repairs There have also been a few recalls on the Taurus This car is as strong as an ox but unfortunately its not not_very not_reliable If my Taurus didnt not_break not_down not_every not_once not_in not_a not_while not_I not_would not_with not_no not_doubt not_keep not_this not_car not_for not_a not_good not_twenty not_years In my opinion this automobile wasnt not_built not_right not_in not_the not_first not_place not_so not_wether not_you not_like not_it not_or not_not not_theres not_going not_to not_be not_a not_big not_repair not_bill not_about not_every not_3 not_5 not_months On the other hand this is a very strong car I used it to haul all of my belongings and furniture when I moved from my 2 bedroom apartment into my new house The main problem with this car is the automatic transmission it suddenly broke down and had to be rebuilt for the car to be drivable and that repair cost me around 1 200
Neg,It rides real smooth even though it is 26 years old It only has 94 000 miles though If you are looking for a car to play with or are looking for a drivetrain combination this full size is the way to go It looks good with a 2 inch drop flowmasters Cragars Ss and fat firehawks especially with Bright yellow paint with a black top and black pinstripes I bought this as a car to fix up and play with It is a 1974 four door I love the power the 26 year old motor 400 M 2V has Tire smoke out of your Grandmas grocery getter I hate the damn AM radio but that will be fixed shortly with a cd player two subs and 8 midbass and treble speakers stereo is another hobby I hate that it is so looooooooooong
Neg,That was the first thing that broke I bought a 1995 F 150 in late 1994 I also sold it in early 1995 It was pulling hard to the left and was very hard to steer I brought it right back to the Ford dealer and they said I needed new hubs It didnt not_get not_up not_and not_go not_like not_my not_old not_Chevys not_used not_to not_Being not_very not_disappointed not_with not_this not_truck not_I not_sold not_it not_right not_after not_winter not_and not_bought not_myself not_a not_1995 not_Chevy not_pick not_up not_I not_was not_much not_more not_satisfied not_with not_that not_then not_I not_ever not_was not_with not_my not_Ford One day as I knew inside it would it broke only 2 months after I got it I was driving through the snow about a foot or so of it and I put the truck in four wheel drive I noticed right away that something was wrong In addition to that the speedometer broke most of the levers inside including my seat levers window roll down levers and many others began to just crack like twigs I then realized this truck was made with very little craftsmanship like any other Ford I ever owned The F 150 also lacked the power I wanted in a full size pick up Here are the reasons why I drove the truck off the lot in November of 1994 I liked the way the F 150 looked I thought it looked pretty tough I also heard a few good things about them from my friends I didnt not_exactly not_baby not_this not_truck but I didnt not_drive not_it not_too not_hard not_I not_maintained not_it well I never beat it to the point where it might break
Neg,Thirty minutes later I was stranded again Where else can you get service like that but FORD The truck wouldnt not_start and it had to be towed As soon as the warranty went out on the truck I started to have more problems The truck was returned for a third time and another 200 later I drove it out of the service station She doesnt understand why her 5 year old Jeep which has 160 000 miles has never left her stranded and an almost brand new truck with less than one quarter of the mileage has left us stranded three times The truck was recalled for a hood latch cruise control problems and then the tires I was fortunate in that I did not not_have not_the not_recalled not_Firestone not_tires not_I not_wanted not_bigger not_tires not_than not_the not_ones not_that not_came not_standard not_with not_the not_truck not_and not_paid not_extra not_for not_them not_I not_consider not_myself not_lucky not_on not_that not_note This is where I am now I HAVE A TRUCK PAYMENT NO TRUCK ALMOST 1 000 IN BILLS AND I STILL DOnt KNOW WHAT IS WRONG WITH MY TRUCK OR HOW MUCH IT WILL COST TO FIX IT I have a brake light that doesnt work an alarm button that is inside the dashboard and the rear windshield wiper doesnt work as well All for the small price of 35 000 I bought this vehicle last year because I wanted a professional looking vehicle that I could drive to a construction site I am an architect I found this Explorer and thought that this vehicle would be perfect for work and recreation I definitely thought this was a good looking vehicle black with dark tinted windows power windows and locks and the smoothest most luxurious ride out of the other trucks I have owned and I have owned quite a few Things started to go wrong when I learned about the recalls The truck would shake when it was running and I took it in to have it serviced I paid roughly 600 for exhaust manifold gasket problems I got it back and as I was leaving the service station I went to turn the alarm back on from valet mode and the button fell off into the dashboard Four days later my wife gets stranded at a meeting because the truck would start and stall when she released the gas Not only was she stranded but she was angry and embarrassed as well She was going to lunch with friends and had to be rescued
Neg,Then the anti theft light started to come on for no reason along with the airbag light which made no sense In the first weeks of owing the car the odometer stopped working which is not not_a not_big not_problem but still lead her to a day without a car I must say when my cousin pulled up in her new stang convertible I was impressed at first sight and then I came to a quick realization she d been taken for a ride It also lacks in power that one would expect from a V8 When you ride in the car you can here the top rattling whenever you hit the slightest bump She bought the car wanting something that would be an attention grabber Well I must say that the most attention that the car has received has been from the mechanic at the Ford dealership The biggest problem remains the oil light if you park the car on a hill the light comes on A week or two ago the intake manifold cracked with left her with a big towing bill and another week and a half without a car The overall ride is not not_smooth not_at not_all not_With not_the not_upkeep not_expenses not_and not_the not_gas not_guzzler not_quality not_that not_these not_cars not_possess not_I not_would not_not not_recommend not_this not_to not_anyone not_unless not_you not_dont not_mind not_spending not_all not_of not_your not_time not_in not_a not_rental not_car
Neg,And my trip mileage counter and odometer are busted I bought a 961 2 red mustang convertible the car of my dreams And of course my service rep thinks I am crazy especially since I am a young woman And he tells me that to fix this problem will cost me alot since it not not_covered not_by not_my not_warrenty Of course I go for looks and not not_practicality not_I not_did not_not not_research not_the not_car not_fully not_and not_I not_wish not_I not_did not_now not_Where not_do not_I not_begin They do not not_accurately not_measure not_the not_mileage not_For not_example not_a not_80 not_mile not_round not_trip not_turned not_into not_a not_5 not_mile not_excursion not_I not_drove not_for not_3 not_hours not_total and all it measured was 5 miles To start after the first week of use I had to get the radiator fixed I got a flat tire and the power steering was messed up I have had various tune ups over the two years that I have had it Recently all of the oxygen sensors went at the same time On top of this I have leak from the engine of what I do not not_know and a leak when it rains from the top I recently drove my car in a blizzard in Upstate NY I cant not_tell not_you not_what not_a not_miserable not_experience not_I not_had not_If not_you not_want not_a not_fun not_looking not_car not_then not_the not_Mustang not_is not_the not_way not_to not_go but if you are looking for a practical car that is reliable I wouldnt not_suggest not_it
Neg,They never tested the lines or anything else They never checked the brakes further then to look at them Yet they had no answer as to why the brakes failed while I was driving it They couldnt answer why 3 different dealerships refused to do anything about my complaints I had and lemon lawed a 1996 Mustang GT Convertible Cute car extremely good looking Driving it was awful Front end shook brakes wouldnt not_stop not_Ford not_did not_not not_stand not_behind not_their not_product and instead implied it was all in my head We wont even mention the fact that the Mustang GT doesnt come anywhere close to the T A and Z28 in horsepower I could get the same horsepower in a 6 cylinder 4 door car i e the 300M that Ford is offering in their supposed sports car I consider the Mustang GT to be a sick joke Every time I was at Ford there were NUMEROUS Mustangs being brought in for repair too many to make it worthwhile They insisted my front end problems were tire related yet I had 3 different sets of tires on the car in the space of 2 years the final set had about 9 000 miles and were practically bald down from 19 000 on the first set which still is less then Goodyears 25 000 suggested mileage and I drive my cars baby like I do not not_beat not_on not_them not_or not_do not_anything not_such not_as not_that not_that not_would not_wear not_tires not_down not_prematurely not_I not_had not_2 not_Trans not_Ams not_prior not_to not_that not_Mustang not_GT not_and not_guess not_what not_I not_got not_after not_I not_won not_the not_lemon not_law not_case not_and not_Ford not_had not_to not_buy not_back not_the not_car not_You not_guessed not_it not_another not_Pontiac not_Trans not_Am
Neg,Id call it a million dollar car Driver side door failed to open from the inside Driver side Seat back went into a state of constant recline My first car for college is likely to be the last Ford I will ever own Driving the Ford Tempo is like being behind the wheel of a death wish This was repaired for free the mechanic said after 6 repairs your 7th is free Radiator Problems Dont buy this vehicle I repeat Dont buy this vehicle Dont take a free Tempo After repairs its extremely expensive By the time I had gotten rid of the vehicle I had experienced all of the following Replaced a CV Joint Lost my Gas gauge and Odometer well it was still there just dead All interior lights malfunctioned Blinker arm fell off Had scalding hot water dumped from the heating coil onto my foot ive never taken a shoe off going down the hi way 70 MPH so quickly in all my life Lost A C Lost Heater Lost Defrost in a snow storm I might add Lost the Muffler The Tie Rod snapped on a curve at 50 MPH causing the wheels to be perpendicular to one another consequently ripping the tire off of the wheel near death experience I could have reached out the window as I was flying through the air and written my name on the near by telephone pole before I landed in some farmers field Ball Joint snapped looked like the wheel had decided to take nap
Neg,And that is exactly what happens The smaller the area the faster it will wear thats just basic physics This includes both the bushing on the strut rod and the inner pivot bushing The lower ball joints are another sore spot Not greasable and prone to rapid wear It sold very well and there were Tempos everywhere Suddenly Tempos werent all that hot an item any more There are many good explanations for this and one of those I will let you in on right now The ball joints on this car are integrated into the complete control arm so when the ball joint portion wears you have to replace the complete lower control arm If the engineers designed it where the inner tie rods were more horizontally mounted there would be more surface area contacted and it would not not_wear not_as not_rapidly There are some very well engineered and built suspensions out there but all the same some very weak and suspect ones in my opinion and my purpose is to help you make a more informed decision But now its too late they are committed to mass production Even when you replace the factory unit with an after market part the names still the same rapid wear This could really be a good thing though because you will get new bushings when you replace the ball joint but if you dont not_need not_bushings you have no choice and at over 125 00 each retail it is an expensive repair to replace both sides The design of the suspension is such that there is quite an angle from where the inner tie rods screw onto the steering rack down to the steering knuckle and this angle dictates that there will be a small contact area where the ball on the rack end of the inner tie rod contacts the bearing surface And even though the parts would be covered with proof of purchase and receipt from the garage you got it done at the labor would have to be covered by you and the hassle of another trip to the garage and being without your vehicle is enough to shy you away from one I have read many reviews on automobiles from aesthetic interior power warranty options etc points of view I believe an important but always neglected area though is from an undercar point of view and let me tell you most people are missing a very important part of researching a prospective major purchase by not not_being not_well not_enough not_informed not_about not_the not_running not_gear If a decision is being made between one of a few different vehicles I hope to help you decide based on my experience which one will be better for you from the standpoint of strength of and reliability of one of the most important parts of the vehicle as a whole the steering and suspension system The Ford Tempo was for years one of the most popular cars on the market There are many problems with other portions of the suspension on the Tempo too like strut mounts and bearings but suffice it to say I am not not_at not_all not_recommending not_any not_of not_you not_to not_consider not_a not_used not_Tempo not_it not_just not_isnt not_worth not_it not_Even not_if not_you not_got not_one not_really not_cheap not_and not_got not_all not_of not_the not_front not_end not_parts not_replaced not_with not_lifetime not_warranty not_after not_market not_parts not_they not_will not_wear not_out not_due not_to not_extreme not_angles not_of not_operation The suspensions on the Tempo were exactly the same as was on the Ford Escort absolute junk Having the constitution of the United States on my side is a very good thing because there is not not_one not_redeeming not_quality not_about not_the not_suspension not_of not_the not_Tempo and if they could the Ford Motor Company and its engineers would sue me for telling you this First off nothing is greasable on the Tempo and the tie rods both inner and outer wear out at a rapid rate as do the lower ball joints
Neg,Thats right my car caught on fire in my friends driveway I have now had the displeasure of owning two of these vehicles The worst part about the Tempo was that I had the same problems with both of them And then he asked me if my Muffler had fallen off yet it hadnt at the time but did less than a month later That oil leak a week after it started smoking and on the day I had bought the part to fix it CAUGHT ON FIRE The first was my first car ever then when someone ran a stop sign and hit me totaling that one my parents bought me another one I ll say this that was all the motivation I needed to save up the money on my own and by my OWN car And my personal favorite the electronic fuel door release just stopped working But that ended up working out for the best because at the time the door itself had stopped shutting I beg you not not_to not_buy not_this not_car not_life not_is not_too not_short not_to not_make not_all not_of not_the not_mistakes not_yourself not_sometimes not_you not_need not_to not_learn not_from not_someone not_elses The oil leaks the muffler rusting out completely the shocks rotting out I even talked to a ford tech to ask him what would be causing my car to smoke and smell bad if it wasnt not_over not_heating not_As not_soon not_as not_I not_told not_him not_it not_was not_a not_tempo not_he not_diagnosed not_it not_as not_an not_oil not_leak Thankfully since we were there to work on the car we caught it before it did any damage Other various problems ive had between my two tempos include not not_starting not_without not_recharging not_the not_battery not_when not_the not_temperature not_dipped not_below not_30 not_which not_happened not_with not_two not_separate not_batteries not_so not_it not_was not_definitely not_the not_car not_busted not_alternator not_the not_seatbelt not_motor not_not not_working not_which not_cost not_500 not_to not_fix not_and not_was not_required not_by not_law not_One not_windows not_motor not_not not_working not_and not_being not_stuck not_up not_two not_windows not_getting not_stuck not_down not_SUCKED not_in not_the not_rain not_a not_radio not_that not_didnt not_shut not_off not_with not_the not_rest not_of not_the not_car not_and not_had not_to not_be not_turned not_off not_manually
Neg,Then it went again Free Then the starter went Repaired for free So the sales person steered me towards the Tempo The third time was less then 6 months after 2 and they wanted me to pay a 50 deductible The price was good and it was shiny new so I bought it I also bought the extended 50 k warranty Before the car hit 25 k the fuel pump went Repaired for free I had a Ford Taurus that was a deathtrap so I went to a Ford dealership to buy a new car thinking that they d have to take it I was planning on getting a Ford Escort GT but they only come in stick shifts This is 200 and of course ive already had this fixed The Ford guy just shrugs and says oh these things keep breaking like that means I should just keep paying for it The car just turned 86 k so im not not_happy not_about not_all not_of not_these not_repeat not_repairs not_since not_im not_the not_one not_paying not_for not_them not_now They keep it for the day and say theres nothing wrong with it the starter is 300 and do I really want it I take it home and it promptly refuses to start I take it to the local car repair shop and they diagnose a starter cellanoid and fix it for 29 00 I also asked the Ford dealership to repair the stupid clicking noise the heater fan which is constantly on makes The boyfriend type man convinced them that they did NOT want to charge me The next time my car wouldnt not_start not_similar not_situation not_to not_when not_the not_starters not_went not_a not_friend not_suggested not_I not_put not_the not_car not_in not_neutral not_and not_let not_it not_roll and it started From that point on I was constantly rolling and starting it Looks stupid when you re not not_on not_an not_incline not_Finally not_the not_rolling not_technique not_stops not_working and I tell the Ford dealership to put in another starter
Neg,The codes are of absolutely no assistance to diagnosing the problems Its the worst vehicle I have every owned and its not not_even not_fixable The gas mileage is just about the same as my old beater 1988 F150 Supercab 3 4 ton truck In fact they just cant not_find not_what not_is not_wrong not_with not_the not_car I bought this 1994 Tempo in June of 1995 for vehicle for business purposes Last summer it was in for service several times a month usually on a tow truck and it is still not not_fixed In fact the last trip from Halifax to Toronto was cheaper driving the truck than the trip 2 months before driving the 1994 Tempo It quits when it gets hot just like an old fashioned vapour lock used to sometimes will restart within ten minutes but sometimes takes a couple of hours it quits or wont start when the weather is wet not not_even not_right after a tune up it quits when you go through a puddle and splash water on the lower part of the engine it may or may not not_start if the weather is cold and the service engine light hardly ever goes off And the truck made it no problems the car broke down Christmas Eve in Montreal and then again in Toronto on Boxing Day I buy a vehicle expecting to get at least ten years out of it My husband has a lot of mechanics tickets for heavy equipment and maintains our vehicles very well As soon as I finish paying off this lemon this summer its going I still have a years warranty left on it but I just cant not_afford not_the not_gas not_the not_downtime not_and not_repairs not_that not_arent not_covered not_Nothing not_the not_Ford not_dealer not_represented not_to not_me not_on not_this not_vehicle not_is not_true To date no one has been able to diagnose what is wrong with this lemon im scared to go anywhere with it You have to carry a cell phone when you do drive it for when you break down I drive about 25 km to work and on a hot day I may not not_make not_it not_to not_work and wont make it home During the hot weather it breaks down about three times a week on my way home and usually the breakdown point is within the same 2 km area I bought extended warranty which to date has covered very few of the repairs
Neg,This is seriously the worst car I have EVER had I bought this car thinking it would be a deal because my friend owns one and he said it has been great for him well little did I know how absolutely terrible this car is it breaks down every 20 miles gets bad gas mileage and it has this odor Its awful I cant not_turn not_on not_the not_heater not_because not_the not_element not_has not_broken not_down not_the not_radio not_hardly not_works not_I not_can not_only not_listen not_to not_KOZY not_106 not_5 not_which not_is not_fine not_but not_it not_gets not_really not_annoying not_the not_steering not_wheel not_sticks not_I not_have not_had not_to not_call not_my not_friends not_and not_family not_so not_many not_times not_to not_come not_pick not_me not_up not_from not_work not_so not_many not_times not_its not_embarrassing not_And not_noone not_will not_buy not_it not_off not_of not_me not_because not_unlike not_me not_they not_are not_smart not_and not_can not_spy not_a not_lemon not_I not_have not_even not_left not_the not_keys not_in not_the not_car not_in not_plain not_view not_in not_high not_hopes not_that not_someone not_would not_steal not_it not_but not_they not_wouldnt not_even not_do not_that not_for not_me
Neg,For this lemon knowing what I know now I wouldnt not_give not_Ford not_the not_first not_MONTHs not_worth not_of not_payments not_for not_this not_money not_pit I have owned my 1994 Ford Tempo now since July of 1995 and though Ford is usually a name you can trust it is not not_in not_this not_case This car has had constant problems with the brakes which no one can seem to fix with the engine itself an oil leak that I swear was there when it left the factory floor bad locks bad door handles I could go on and on and on I thought that this would be a reliable family type car big enough for groceries yet not not_so not_big that it would be hard to handle Instead I find that this car is so unreliable and shoddily made as far as I am concerned it should never have been built in the first place Due to financial trouble I got roped into paying 52 37 a week FOR FIVE YEARS
Neg,At first it was a good car I bought a used 1987 Ford Tempo GL for my wife The car is a nice car dont not_get not_me not_wrong but I think there are mechanical problems with it that make this car a bad choice But then things went wrong I had to put several hundred dollars into the car in the past 2 years the air conditioner dont not_work not_I not_had not_to not_replace not_the not_computer and its still running bad I guess I should have got the hint when we found all the paperwork on the car and there where several receipts from mechanic work done on the car And I have seen several Tempos on the side of the road broke down I also know that Tempos have an exhaust leak problem ive seen a lot of Tempos that are very load because the muffler need to be replaced
Neg,My tailpipe and my muffler have fallen off My right window on the passenger side doesnt even open The scariest thing is that when you drive sometimes the door flies open When you are in park it feels like you are in an earthquake The first day I drove it over 10 miles it locked up and was unable to drive Two nice things are the comfy seats especially when you are waiting for someone and the roomy trunk Dependable seekers look else where No matter where you are the inter state or a rural road Even when its locked I wouldnt not_recomend not_this not_car not_Its not_too not_unsafe This was my first car unfortunately its been a huge problem for me In less than a year I have already invested at least half its worth The trunk doesnt open unless you have the car on The doors stick and you have to repeatedly press unlock to get it to unlock My mileage has constantly gone done averaging about 15 miles a gallon ive changed the brakes 3 times in less than a year and they still squeak when I stop The throttle cable hangs up and makes it so sometimes that you cant not_even not_make not_it not_go not_over not_45 not_miles not_an not_hour not_unles not_you not_re not_lucky not_enough not_to not_hit not_that not_big not_of not_a not_hill It rattles no matter what The central air is tricky you have to press off every time you turn off the car or when you turn the air back on it will be on defrost
Neg,That wasnt not_a not_surprise No one wants to ride in my death trap I bought a 1994 Tempo after my Hyundai XL completely died Shops will tell them that there is nothing wrong with them until the brakes have been damaged so much that the whole system needs to be replaced My brakes make constant noise most of the time but that day they chose to remain quiet after I took it in Anyway I told the repair shop to fix the brake It worked fine right up until the point that my extended warranty ran out Of course I wasted 3000 and I still have nearly 3000 to pay on the loan on a car that isnt not_worth not_1500 It cost me over 200 and I couldnt tell that there was a difference when I took it back Since then I still have bad brakes and while I no longer smell gas or witness gas leaking I get about 10 miles to the gallon My car has begun to make a rattling noise and the trunk catch is broken I have to tie my trunk down im a student and I cant not_afford not_a not_car not_that not_causes not_me not_constant not_problems not_ive not_heard not_about not_other not_Tempo not_owners not_who not_were not_constantly not_paying not_to not_repair not_brakes There have also been numerous reports about gas tank problems and cars catching on fire because of leaks im not not_repairing not_anything not_on not_this not_car not_im not_getting not_rid not_of not_it The only other good thing about it is that it has a lot of trunk room and plenty of back seat space Not that I get to use that space My brakes had been causing me constant squeaking and grinding problems for over a year I thought that my brake problems were solved Yeah right Previously I had paid over 400 at Midas to get them fixed and they ended up worse than when I took them in I took them back and they reported that there was absolutely nothing wrong with them The driver side window has to be manually forced down and the driver side rear window squeaks when being rolled down Another con is that the back windows only roll down half way A couple of months ago the gas tank started leaking At first I could smell the gas and once my friend witnessed a couple of gallons just pouring out into the gutter I took it to a repair shop and they told me that nothing was wrong with the gas tank but they did find out that my rear right brake needed work It was one of two Tempos on the Ford lot and the only two cars in my budget range I was in college and working two part time jobs I purchased the extended warranty for almost 3000 and never used it which was stupid because the seatbelt motors went bad after I had the car for a week so my automatic seatbelts wouldnt not_work and made loud noises trying to work I just didnt not_have not_the not_time not_to not_go not_into not_the not_dealership not_because not_I not_was not_in not_classes not_and not_working not_constantly not_Needless not_to not_say not_they not_are not_still not_broken not_and not_it not_probably not_wouldnt not_have not_been not_covered not_anyway not_My not_extended not_warranty not_only not_covered not_major not_body not_work
Neg,Our family has big tall people He had used it 5 months This car is not not_designed not_for not_Big not_Tall not_people Since that time a muffler has come out the transmission has gone out the door quit working the windows quit and other technicalities It is for Little people 4 8 5 5 We are getting rid of it DO NOT GET THIS CAR WE HAVE SPENT LOTS OF MONEY ON REPAIRS AND YOU WILL TOO My Family purchased this car after our 1988 Ford Taurus Station Wagon went out We thought well since that was a good car why dont not_we not_try not_this not_one not_Our not_mechanic not_sold not_it not_to not_us
Neg,Ok back to the car buy a Taurus instead It was a great car for the first day and I still think the interior is rather comfortable not not_roomy by any means but comfortable This is a very minimalist car no special features pretty basic interior pretty sluggish etc etc etc Its only great feature is that its a cheap car to fix And fix you will do a lot This car makes more noises than a synthesizer unfortunately they dont not_sound not_as not_good not_Watch not_out not_for not_the not_harmonic not_balancer This car would make a great pic nic table or maybe a great fountain in the front yard if you gutted it out This car would be absolutely great just as long as you werent driving it I absolutely hate my Ford Tempo In fact if you can dont not_buy not_a not_Ford not_So not_to not_reflect not_on not_what not_ive not_just not_written not_this is a bad car a very very bad car Dont buy one you wont be happy unless you are a really twisted person This happened to me after the first month Basically it makes a sound like a jackhammer in the distance especially when making a turn Apparently this problem is so common that when I took it to the shop the mechanic ran upto my car before I left it and told me I needed to replace my harmonic balancer Apparently Ford stuck a very cheap one in the tempo that cracks on a regular basis
Neg,This solved the problem It wasnt not_terribly not_old not_though It was a four wheel drive regular cab short bed You could floor the gas pedal without ANY acceleration It had about 114 000 miles on it and ran great About a year ago I sold my 1990 Ford Ranger STX 4x4 I had good reason to sell it It was so incredibly unreliable It had a 5 speed manual transmission 2 9L V 6 engine AM FM cassette My Ranger was a nice looking off white with tan cloth interior and bucket seats with console When I took it in for the third time to get the stupid four wheel drive fixed I was told that it needed a new 4x4 engage disengage motor My father had the truck since new and pampered it Two weeks after he gave it to me the engine started smoking really bad I took it in to the local Ford dealer Within a month of that happening the clutch started slipping but didnt not_bother not_fixing not_it not_because not_I not_had not_already not_put not_so not_much not_money not_in not_to not_it not_and not_couldnt not_afford not_the not_clutch At about the same time the speedometer stopped working occasionally I dont not_know not_if not_poor not_reliability not_like not_this not_is not_normal not_for not_a not_truck not_or not_not not_but not_I not_will not_never not_buy not_a not_truck not_again not_Not not_to not_mention not_that not_it not_was not_rediculously not_slow not_on not_the not_highway It was a very attractive truck but constantly needed some kind of repair Literally every month something went wrong with it My father had given it to me because he knew I needed a vehicle and he wanted something newer It got terrible gas mileage too I only had it about six months during all of this before I traded it in for a car Dont consider a truck unless you ABSOLUTELY need one Trucks tend to be slow accelerating gas guzzling and unsafe vehicles compared to cheaper cars They said it needed pretty much all new seals and gaskets A 600 repair A couple of weeks after that the A C stopped working a 400 repair A month after that I accidentally pressed the four wheel drive button and it got stuck on I took it back to the Ford dealer I was told that there was too much grease on the front hubs and it was causing the four wheel drive to stick wrong
Neg,We bought this truck back in 1991 from a woman in our community With all of its problems its never cost over 275 at one time to repair Mostly its just replacing of belts and filters or adjusting the corborater Since this truck has lasted so long with its problems I would consider buying another Ford truck in the future I cant not_really not_recommend not_the not_new not_Rangers since I know nothing about Fords quality now We got it with less than 80 000 miles on it at the time Now it has nearly 170 000 Sure it drinks and drips loads of oil and isnt not_very not_good not_on not_gas not_milage not_anymore but that truck is made like a Timex Presently it smokes from the wore out muffler and some other place on the engine I have to ride the breaks when im at a red light and it never ever wants to start when its the least bit cold outside but my little truck is paid for and its never let me down
Neg,This car spends more time getting fixed then it does on the road But the biggest problem is that the car has less than 117 000 km and now the transmission has blown What the say about FORD found on road dead or fix or repair daily definitely applies to this model When I bought the car it had 28 000 km on it I thought the price was a good deal but let me tell you it was no deal I made a big mistake and bought a 1997 Ford Taurus SE I used to work at a large Ford dealership and thought I still had lots of friends at the dealership so I went there to buy my car This vehicle gets good gas mileage and does not not_burn not_a not_lot not_of not_oil However the bad out weighs the good For a domestic car the repair bills are quite costly and the parts are not not_as not_easy not_to not_get not_as not_you not_would not_think Unless you like to spend a lot of money and love to read the magazines and check out the guys at the shop I dont not_recommend not_this not_car not_to not_anyone not_I not_know not_that not_I not_will not_be not_unloading not_mine not_as not_fast not_as not_possible The dome light stays on whenever it feels like the heater motor went 6 months after we bought it the cable that runs form the steering column to the transmission snapped right after the 60 000 km warranty ran out There are power surges when you slow down for lights or stop signs The car has shown well in safety tests probably because its always in the shop and not not_on not_the not_road and is quite comfortable and roomy in the front and trunk is large and can hold just about anything Ford rates it as dependable and reliable Well the people who rate the dependability and reliability of this model must not not_own not_one Even though I know a mechanic that charges me less than the going rate for labor this repair is going to set me back approx 3 000 with the cost of car rental for 10 days I can say however that the car rides nice and smooth and the steering so far has been good it corners well and does not not_shake not_and not_shimmy not_at not_speeds not_of not_100 not_km not_or not_more With the time is spends in the shop and the cost to repair it just is not not_worth not_it not_When not_I not_spoke not_with not_the not_dealership not_one not_of not_the not_sales not_guys not_laughed not_at not_me and said that the Taurus is just not not_a not_good not_car not_thanks not_for not_selling not_it not_to not_me not_Not not_only not_that not_but not_the not_place not_that not_my not_mechanic not_sent not_the not_transmission not_said not_that not_he not_already not_has not_4 not_Tauruss not_97 not_and not_newer not_that not_have not_the not_same not_problem
Neg,UPDATE So we use the portable CD player in the car The power lumbar in an upper model may fix this Secondly But if it were my money i think that i could find a better suited car for the money that it is worth The exterior of the car is like the title said a Fish car Altho for 2000 Ford realized their blunder and tried to remedy the situation When you sit in either of the front seats your upper torso namely your shoulders are pushed forward in an awkward position not not_comfortable at all After this epinion was posted the car having about 55 000 miles on it had the transmission go out of it The trans would refuse to go into gear The control pod with the radio and climate controls is not not_well not_designed not_First not_the not_buttons not_are not_all not_similar not_and not_close not_together not_somewhat not_so not_making not_it not_hard not_to not_distinguish not_radio not_controls not_from not_climate not_controls The 3rd thing is that there is no good place for a portable CD player to sit My first choice would be an aftermarket stereo but its a company car and the control pod limits the modifications that can be done to the stereo While thankfully i did not not_buy not_the not_taurus i still must drive it My fiancee has this car as her company car it being a 97 model while the 3 0 L V6 has some pep the rest of the car is all down hill from there The round rear window and the low trunk looks very strange to me the tauruss sister the sable looks a bit better from the front using some chrome accents Inside there are a host of things that annoy both of us First off is Fords attempt at stationary lumbar support In order to have a place to put the CD player the armrest must be in the folded out position which requires the use of a corded Y adaptor for ciggaret lighter power because the armest when open will not not_allow not_the not_ashtray not_to not_be not_open not_Aside not_from not_these not_things the taurus is a rather safe car The cost of the repairs were estimated at 2500 I do also know for a fact that a close friend of mine who was a ford fan had also had a 97 taurus and his transmission went out at about 65 000 miles Apparently according to the dealership ford knows that this is a problem but will not not_really not_do not_anything not_to not_help not_their not_customers not_I not_definetally not_cannot not_reccomend not_anyone not_buying not_this not_kind not_of not_car not_original not_epinion
Neg,This car was both We had 8 000 miles on the car He said they only repair the portions that failed The dealer found that the transmission had a problem and only fixed the portion that was causing the problem We felt we were OK because it was new and came with the manufacturers warranty 3 year 36 000 bumper to bumper Some seals were bad as well as some valves I asked why they wouldnt not_replace not_the not_entire not_transmission not_considering not_it not_failed not_after not_only not_8 not_000 not_miles We used the car primarily for cross country trips and it did quite well But on our third trip we noticed the transmission was very tough to shift into gear When we bought this car we did not not_want not_to not_spend not_a not_lot not_of not_money not_Ours not_was not_the not_last not_of not_its not_kind not_on not_the not_lot not_its not_a not_97 not_G but we bought it new in 98 Its stripped down it has an AM FM stereo and power windows but no power locks or trunk release from inside the vehicle a definite negative Still these issues were minor because we wanted a car with a good safety rating and we needed a car that was relatively inexpensive In my opinion I have a defective transmission which is begging to fail and strand me or my wife and kids in the middle of nowhere Ford was not not_willing not_to not_replace not_the not_transmission not_Despite not_this not_major not_flaw not_the not_transmission not_is not_still not_not not_working not_perfectly and the warranty has expired the car has been fairly reliable During the three years we ve owned it we ve barely put 35 000 miles on it All of the repairs done were covered by the warranty see below I wont say it was free however because each time I took the car in for repairs they kept the car all day and I had to make other arrangements to get to work 1 transmission pseudo repaired it works but not not_perfectly not_2 power steering pump noisy and replaced 3 emissions switch a light came on in the dash informing us to check the engine had to go to a dealer we were on vacation and spent the morning there while the switch was replaced 4 weather stripping on passenger front door seal was broken between the door and the car body replaced
Neg,My point is save yourself trouble and hassle and RUN dont walk away from that Ford Dealership This car not not_only has given me a ton of trouble but its always strange odd trouble Car troubles that no one has ever heard about Last year I had to replace the engine because I drove through a puddle Since 1997 when I bought my 97 Ford Taurus I have gotten to know my auto repair man very well I have spent more time waiting in his shop in the past few years than I have going out with my husband Thats right the engine Sometimes when I step on the brakes the rear defrost goes on Of course this is just the mild trouble other problems ive had include the interior lights never going out causing the battery to die Sometimes the alarm goes off while im driving I truly believe I could make a horror movie comparable to the Amityville Horror house move about this car
Neg,There are also 2 safety issues i have with this car first one is the engine mounts fell off yes my engine flew to the ground just about they did recallit butnot until after ipaid that expense The second and more serious flaw is that on a 90 degree turn into oncoming traffic the turn signal switch that is inside the steering column broke off inside causing me to loose control of all steering They still have not not_recalled not_this not_even not_though not_i not_know not_many not_people not_this not_happened not_to not_and not_they not_called not_it not_in not_also not_I not_would not_never not_purchase not_a not_ford not_taurus not_again not_heck not_i not_wouldnt not_even not_take not_one not_for not_free not_unless not_i not_owned not_a not_money not_tree Ford taurus have to be the worse car on the road today mechanically sure it looked good but not not_worth not_all not_the not_money not_you not_need not_to not_sink not_in not_to not_it not_to not_keep not_it not_running not_I not_put not_a not_total not_of not_4 not_transmissions not_in not_mine not_and not_even not_that not_one not_was not_on not_it not_way not_out not_when not_i not_traded not_it not_in
Neg,Then theres the TRANSMISSION They adjusted the computer So we tried another Ford dealer Then it needed still more adjustment We bought it the car and the story This dealer couldnt fit us in for 4 weeks First it was a hard shift on my automatic transmission They said the second dealer had to take us They refused and said we werent damaging the car The brakes had to be totally redone after just two months They told us that the car was just off of a lease When they did finally see our car they said we needed a whole new transmission The Ford reason for the rust and corrosion was the car had stood too long Yeah on their LOT I will NEVER buy a Ford vehicle again I bought my 2 year old Taurus from a reputable Ford dealer They wouldnt not_touch not_a not_car not_that not_another not_Ford not_dealer not_had not_already not_touched not_We not_called not_FORDs not_800 not_number It had never been in an accident the brakes were new and we still would have one year left on the original warranty The dealer then said they were too busy to get us in We called the original dealer and asked for a loaner as we didnt not_want not_to not_damage not_the not_transmission They then said that the warranty had run out and besides it must have been something we did We ve since learned that Ford Taurus has a history of transmission problems and obviously dont not_back not_their not_product not_NEVER not_EVER not_AGAIN
Neg,Hey its practically new The sunroof then refused to close We drove maybe fifteen minutes from the hotel to a cafe In early 1998 I purchased a 1997 Ford Taurus SHO program car from my local dealer Tilt button while looking for the map light in the dark of course We checked into our hotel and decided to grab a bite to eat before the concert The car had been purchased and used by Ford as a Junior Executive automobile whatever that means The car was back into the shop within the first two weeks to have the Football replaced In the mean time while visiting family in Iowa at Christmas time I accidentally pressed the sunroof This problem took about 7 visits 3 different CD units and the course of six months to finally get straighten The vehicle itself was in great shape with only 15 K miles on it so my wife and I figured It seemed a bit early to have this motor replaced but it was under warranty so I didnt not_complain not_too not_much Things seemed to go fine for about three weeks when the CD changer wouldnt not_register not_that not_there not_were not_any not_CDs not_and not_wouldnt not_release not_the not_CD not_cartridge We spent about another 15 20 minutes eating When I got back out to the car after eating it was dead Nothing Nada When I turned the ignition key abosolutely nothing happened The tape deck unit was not not_functioning not_properly not_so not_the not_entire

not_had not_to not_take not_it not_back not_to not_the not_dealer not_to not_have not_the not_drivers not_side not_rear not_window not_motor not_replaced It took long enough for Ford to show any signs of customer service I was very diasappointed in the way that Ford handled the situation I expect that cars have some problems but it seemd to me that 12 times for warranty repair in 12 months on a car with less that 30 K miles was a bit unacceptable So far knock on wood the car hasnt been in for anything other than routine maitenance oil brakes etc in about 10 months or so Maybe the problems have worked themselves out I cannot not_recommend not_the not_SHO not_version not_of not_this not_car not_to not_anyone not_who not_doesnt not_have not_the not_time not_or not_patience not_to not_deal not_with not_a not_car not_that not_is not_constantly not_in not_the not_shop It took about 25 minutes of me standing in 4 inches of snow and my wife trying from the inside to get the sunroof closed to this day the sunroof still doesnt close everytime you press the close button Upon our return we once again took the car to the dealer for warranty repairs A few months passed with no further problems from the car everything seemed to work properly It was at this point that I starting telephoning Ford Customer Service who most of the time were rude and told me they had no further interest in me or my vehicle problems After 9 phone calls and 6 months of complaining a call to a lawyer and hassling with the local dealer who all they wanted to do was trade in this car and sell me another one Ford finally gave me a 75 K mile warranty on my car One afternoon while leaving on another trip to Charlotte about 3 hours I took the car through one of these gas station car washes when the sunroof leaked water on my wife Upon further inspection we found that while being closed flush on the drivers side the passenger side of the sunroof failed to close the entire way leaving about an 1 8

Neg,And to think this all happened before I could make my first loan payment Then I had problems with the tranny slipping and when you put it in reverse none of the electrical worked Then as I drove home from a long vacation at night made a right hand turn and the headlights shorted out We ended up sleeping at a rest stop until the sun came up and comfort is not not_included not_with not_the not_oval not_theme Could things get any worse I loved how it looked after that it was all down hill Besides the neat oval theme there is nothing about this car I liked First problem was a short in the steering column ever time you turn right the radio would shut off
Neg,In the beginning The dashboard is arranged in an orderly fashion As a whole the interior is very roomy As a whole the car performs well We bought our 1997 Ford Taurus used in 1998 The seats are very comfortable although the drives seat could have more lumbar support This isnt not_the not_best not_car not_to not_be not_taking not_on not_long not_highway not_trips Other than that the car will perform well Next there is the interior All the radio A C and heating controls are in one area which makes it very easy to memorize It had 10 000 miles on it and was the GL edition Unfortunately we were looking forward to getting another Crown Victoria but none were in our price range It seemed hard to get the car to cruising speed Once at cruising speed things cool down a bit but try to accelerate from cruising speed and the car will give out quite a shudder It started everytime you wanted it to and did great in the snow While driving around in suburban areas the car is a dream its a smooth ride quite quiet and the car itself has no trouble However once you hit try to go on the highway things get a bit shakey There is enough room for me being 6 feet to sit in the front and my friend of the same height to sit in the back without us having our knees at our ears Unfortunately much of the interiors moving parts were made of plastic which broke of when over used As a whole this car was ok I never got used to how many miles to the gallon you could get in the Taurus and the stuff you could fit in it Although towards 70 k miles this car started needing expensive repairs it lived through a trip to Washington DC and my Mother who runs child day care in our house and used it many times to transport them For this cars performance i wish we had gotten another Crown Victoria we still our 1988 one which has 147 000 miles and still out performs the Taurus
Neg,The static is still there I bought my 1997 Taurus LX from Tom Wood Ford in Indianapolis in April of 1998 The service department will not not_replace not_the not_stereo not_because not_they not_are not_afraid not_Ford not_will not_charge not_them not_for not_the not_item not_if not_it not_tests not_OK not_at not_Ford not_In not_the not_meantime not_both not_Ford not_and not_Capital not_City not_have not_ensured not_that not_my not_wifes not_next not_car not_will not_be not_a not_Daimler not_Chrysler In fairness I have a Ford Ranger that is flawless but my Taurus is a piece of junk I called Ford to have them tell the dealership to fix the problem and they gave me the runaround Goodbye Ford hello Chrysler 300M It was a demo and had 6 000 miles on it Listing for 28 700 I paid 21 000 for it I asked the dealer twice to provide an owners manual none was ever provided so I switched dealers to Capital City Ford I have had the Taurus in the shop MANY times for non routine items including The cigarette plug broke the overdrive switch broke a component in the steering linkage failed and the stereo is garbage Let me tell you about the 700 mach 460 radio Ford is so proud of It has intermittent static in the front speakers and I have taken it to Capital City Ford FIVE times to be repaired
Neg,I honestly cant not_complain not_about not_the not_engine not_or not_transmission not_or not_any not_other not_major not_component not_of not_my not_1997 not_Taurus not_GL The drivers side went soon after that And now none of my windows roll down The parts from what we have discovered are only available through Ford which means big money It has always gotten me where I need to go and has always started up in the morning etc However about 2 000 miles after my 36 000 mile warranty expired all sorts of things started to go awry First the passenger side window automatic of course stopped rolling down When you get into the car the little light showing that a door is ajar remains on along with the dome light and all other interior lights Its quite embarrassing driving down the highway at night with your car lit up like Times Square So my husband messed with it until he got a couple of the windows working im still waiting for the dome light to go out or the battery to run down first im anxious to trade this baby in before anything else happens
Neg,The next engine is the Essex 3 8 engine The exterior looks much like the 1st generations The interior does boast tons of room trunk room included The price for a 1992 LX Taurus will cost you around 3 000 dollars The 1992 also weighs more than its predecessor tipping the scales for the first time over 3 100lbs This engine cranks out an impressive 220 horsepower and will burn rubber if you dont not_watch not_your not_right not_foot not_at not_a not_stop not_light The 6 speaker Ford sound system probably would have been good but it didnt not_work not_so not_I not_cant not_comment not_Exterior not_Innovation not_i This engine unfortunately is only available in the top of the line SHO models and they only come with a 5 speed manual for this year There were tears in the headliner and vanity mirrors the carpet was worn the back seat had tears in the cheap leather This car not not_only was slow in the lightweight models of the mid 1980s but for 1992 its even slower with the added weight and no increase in engine power When I say wash off in a number of cases this actually happened with first generation Ford Taurus i Price i There is 6 way power seats with lumbar support

looked plush the headliner fitted like a nice pair of leather pants and the transmission as silky smooth as my skin thats me trying to be funny Anyway enough about probablys this car is now 10 years old and it is pretty darn close to what many would consider junk The 1992 Ford Taurus was now in its 2nd generation many car companies for 1992 had revised their sedans to look more aerodynamic so Ford had to do something to stay on top in the style department Unfortunately this attempt resulted in a more blase look The 1992 Ford Taurus while improved in some areas never made it past 1st base

Neg,Also the cupholder is incredibly poorly made The 1992 Ford Taurus has sluggish pep and corners like a rhinoceros The car is either built poorly or has gremlins The radiator has been replaced twice as have the cooling fan and hoses There is also an annoying momentary hesitation when the gas pedal is pushed down My 1992 Ford Taurus has 85 000 miles on it and is ready for the junk heap Whoever thought this up must not not_ever not_crack not_their not_windows not_which not_is not_the not_preferred not_degree not_I not_want not_them not_open The brakes have been replaced twice in there entirety because Ford brakes do not not_have not_the not_tell not_tale not_squeal not_feature not_to not_inform not_one not_that not_the not_pads not_are not_becoming not_thin It has a thin hinged bar underneath that looks something like a U When you hit a bump that U sways forward There are no advantages to having this car that I can discern I would say all in all stay far far away from this automobile The brakes work fine between fixings and the car does have relatively ample trunk space but the Fords cupholder is located directly below the radio so it is very hard to drink anything and change stations Another thing I find annoying this is really a tangent as most cars have this feature is that when you touch the electric window button the windows rolls down all the way automatically If you hit a few bumps it sways enough that it comes out from beneath the cup bottle and you have drink all over your legs floor seat and in my case my passport which is now partially stained purple and redolent of grape soda It is just not not_a not_well not_built not_car not_I not_purchased not_it not_in not_1995 not_for not_5 not_500 and at the time it had only 15 000 miles on it no the odometer had not not_been not_turned not_back not_Since not_then not_I not_have not_put not_untold not_amounts not_of not_money not_into not_this not_lemon not_and not_it not_is not_nevertheless not_on not_its not_last not_legs So what are the advantages of owning this car Well as im sure you are all aware the Ford Taurus is one of the sleekest cars on the road with its sexy boxiness and sultry lack of curves I find women often turn there head as I drive by whistle and say nice Taurus lt Yeah right It also is a process that requires many hours of time which I frankly do not not_have not_Now not_you not_may not_be not_thinking not_that not_with not_all not_this not_repair not_I not_must not_have not_been not_very not_hard not_on not_the not_car not_Actually not_no not_I not_garage not_the not_car not_usually not_have not_relatively not_frequent not_oil not_changes not_and not_tune not_ups not_and not_I not_dont not_drive not_like not_a not_maniac Thus you find out they are bad when you start to hear metal grinding at which time you realize you are about to owe an extra 200 Just this year I blew both heads on the engine needed a new battery new engine mount new sway bars new struts for the second time new battery cables new calipers another new coolant fan had to have my electric window fixed on drivers side when it froze and my transmission is shot but I havent taken care of that yet The only thing on this car that has been reliable is the body which has not not_rusted not_at not_all and I live in NY with harsh winters and salt on the road Why do I still own this car Well I am lazy I dont not_know not_about not_you but shopping for a new car is something I look forward to with the same zeal as root canal
Neg,They re just not not_built not_to not_survive not_more not_than not_a not_few not_years The water pump was shot Over the next seven months I got to know my mechanic very well The car is very comfortable and a dream to ride in but you can never assume that you reach your destination I purchased my 92 Ford Taurus in 1999 based on my loan officers opinion of what size loan I could handle Obviously he didnt not_figure not_the not_maintenance not_costs not_into not_that not_estimate In less than twenty four hours literally I found myself stranded on the side of a major highway screeching into a pay phone that yes they most certainly would send a tow truck The transmission nearly fell out from under the car and did manage to crack the planetary planetary what I havent a clue but it cost 1500 to replace Soon after I also replaced the heater coil window motor and the air conditioner twice in southern Mississippi you have to have the AC I hitched a ride to the mechanic so many times that I honestly cant not_remember not_every not_thing not_that not_had not_to not_be not_fixed not_or not_replaced not_During not_the not_last not_month not_of not_my not_ownership not_the not_transmission not_began not_slipping not_again not_and not_the not_wiring not_went not_completely not_nuts not_I not_honestly not_dont not_know not_a not_single not_person not_who not_has not_purchased not_a not_used not_Taurus not_of not_any not_year not_that not_didnt not_have not_major not_problems not_with not_the not_car
Neg,The window sticker stated that my vehicle should get 16 City and 21 Highway Id like to hear from other Expedition owners to see if their Expeditions had similar gas mileage claims This is my main beef with this vehicle Either I purchased a lemon or Ford is inappropriately labeling these vehicles This couldnt be any further from the truth With numbers like 16 21 I should average about 18 19 MPG overall right I average 13 1 MPG Thinking at first that the problem may be my driving for a period I drove speed limits only and attempted to monitor my take offs and such and my mileage only improved by 1 MPG It will get virtually the same mileage as the underpowered 4 6 and will make driving much more pleasurable Ps If you do purchase an Expedition or if you already own one think about replacing your factory shocks with a pair of Bilstein Shocks I did and they made it handle 100 better reducing its rear end bounce and body lean I purchased my Eddie Bauer Expedition three months ago I compared the Tahoe and Expedition head to head before making my decision I hate to be a stick in the mud as everyone at Epinions that has rated their Expedition seems to really love them but I personally think I may have blundered in not not_buying not_a not_Tahoe One of my close friends purchased a Chevy Tahoe with a 5 3 V 8 He claims that he is averaging about 18 MPG I drove a Tahoe with this engine and it is a powerhouse Even GMs smaller 4 8 seemed to have a lot more power than Fords 4 8 If you absolutely love the Expedition and dont not_care not_about not_gas not_mileage not_buy not_the not_5 not_4 not_engine What initially sold me on the Expedition was the overall cost My Expedition was about 2000 less than a comparable equipped Tahoe LT and I purchased it at a time when Ford was offering a great APR on all Expeditions I secured a loan for 2 9 over 60 months compared to GMs 7 9 The Ford had more gadgets and my kids went nuts over the entertainment system with the flip down TV that came as a free option from Ford on my particular model My Expedition has the 4 6 V 8 I chose the 4 6 over the 5 4 for better fuel economy or so I thought
Neg,The interior materials have been upgraded The front fenders and hood are new though The front seat is roomy enough with good comfort The Toyota Sienna is the new ugly queen in this segment For the Freestar most of the sheetmetal remains unchanged The low gloss materials do not not_look not_luxurious but do look durable The third row is perhaps the most cramped of any extended length minivan The culprits are very thick inner pedestrals under the second row captain 146s chairs The Freestar at 201 inches is within an inch of most competitors The various buttons feel a bit higher in quality than those of past Fords Well the basic engine is still here but hopefully the 3 8 146s weaknesses have been eliminated At any rate the new front end seems to have done much to lend the van better proportions The styling of the Windstar always looked awkward to me Something just was not not_right not_with not_the not_proportions The basic forms are square most notably the nearly square center stack Few curves are to be found This despite the fact that the Freestar is an inch longer than the Toyota in both overall length and wheelbase Three clearly labelled steps are involved one more than in the Odyssey But might the Freestar somehow surprise me I took one for a test drive to find out Styling The instruments with their chrome rings are probably the nicest looking bit Most off putting is the fake wood in the SEL trim line The Freestars third row seat does stow into the deep well provided for it fairly easily Thankfully the long side of the trapezoid is on top With some Windstars it has been on the bottom suggesting a frown With the top of the line Limited both pieces are faux wood With the SEL however only the strip is faux wood But some people might prefer the more closed in feeling of the Ford as it might make them feel safer The driver 146s seat itself is memorable for neither discomfort nor exceptional comfort Still the front row is easily the best in the van On the upper trim lines a center console is a 150 option They aren 146t quite up to the Passat 146 s but they were clearly an attempt in that direction compared to past Fords The third row now folds Honda style into the floor A full battery of safety features is now available including stability control and curtain airbags The new front end is more massive than the old ones and is cleanly styled much like Ford 146s current range of SUVs with a large trapezoidal grille The Mustang and T Bird get grandfathered but all other Ford car names that begin with a letter other than 147F 148 will soon be history When the third row is in place the deep well can be used for cargo The leather has a thick durable feel to it The top of the dash is soft touch material the lower part is hard plastic typical of this class of vehicle But apparently not not_so not_much to get rid of the 147star 148 bit The downside of this new strategy is that it seems to be resulting in some awful names The center consoles available in the Chrysler and Toyota vans are significantly larger Why do this Well beginning all SUV names with the letter 147E 148 seems to have worked well Also 147Windstar 148 had a lot of baggage The second row seats tumble forward to provide access to the third row I found it nearly as easy to simply walk between the captain 146s chairs The Japanese vans and especially the Honda feel considerably quicker Why the new name Well someone high up at Ford decided it would be neat to begin all Ford car model names with the letter 147F 148 But I had not not_yet not_driven not_the not_new

not_Especially not_in not_a not_Chrysler not_the not_view not_forward not_is not_much not_more not_expansive It is a good size to hold grocery bags upright preventing their contents from rolling about the entire floor The maximum cargo volume 134 cubic feet is about ten cubic feet shy of the extended minivan norm Probably those thick rear sidewalls again I always thought 147Windstar 148 was a dumb name Well it 146s not not_looking not_so not_bad not_now not_that not_they not_146ve not_updated not_the not_Windstar not_and not_renamed not_it not_147 not_Freestar not_148 The payoff for this below average handling is excellent ride quality This model year has seen new minivans from Toyota and Nissan as well Reviewing the Honda recently I concluded that none of the existing vans was perfect Each had significant weaknesses It is not not_very not_wide not_because not_the not_parking not_brake not_like not_the not_Windstar not_146s not_is not_between not_the not_front not_seats Yet the interior is tighter than all other extended vans with the possible exception of GM 146s it has been a while since I sat in the back of a GM minivan The downside is that they and those in the second row are not not_high not_enough not_in not_their not_lowest not_position not_to not_protect not_adults The steering is not not_overly not_light not_unlike not_many not_past not_Ford not_products not_Lean not_is not_moderate The interior possesses little in the way of style good or bad Unless you find the Passat 146s interior stylish because the Freestar 146s interior is a blatant knock off of the VW sedan 146 s However although the seat moves the pedestals do not not_So not_moving not_the not_seat not_doesn not_146t not_help not_unless not_you not_move not_it not_so not_far not_up not_that not_third not_row not_passengers not_can not_put not_their not_feet not_on not_top not_of not_the not_pedestals This ride quality was obtained through intelligent design not not_simply through ultra soft suspension settings Between these pedestals there is only room for one foot to squeeze in Where should the second foot go The second row seats adjust fore and aft a few inches to juggle legroom It isn 146t very tall not not_even coming up to the level of the seat cushions and contains only a sedan sized storage compartment The three lower trim lines s SE SES have matte black on the center stack and a strip of faux aluminum dividing the darker upper part of the instrument panel from the lighter lower part the rest of the interior is in the lighter shade There is plenty of storage aside from the optional console but some people will still want it because of its handy location Yet only two people sit in the Ford 146s second row even with the bench while three sit in the third row I don 146t get it Legroom or more specifically footroom is also limited in the third row The van understeers heavily in turns and generally communicates that it does not not_wish not_to not_be not_hurried Their weakest area may be cheap looking interiors Cars generally ride poorly on this road but in the Freestar imperfections were heard only a little and felt even less As I suggest in my Odyssey review The typical discount and a 1 000 rebate reduce this to about 28 000 Other storage compartments are located in the Freestar 146s center stack roof console doors and atop the center of the instrument panel A fairly large glove compartment is also provided It so happens that both will be revised for 2005 The Honda and Chrysler seem the best products when price is considered The Honda is easily worth the extra money because of its superior powertrain roomier interior more comfortable rear seats and less rapid depreciation As a result the van remain composed over rough surfaces and did not not_bobble not_about not_Safety not_Like not_the not_Windstar not_the not_Freestar not_should not_ace not_crash not_tests The Kia Sedona is cheaper still but is considerably smaller than the others and at any rate only marginally competitive Those uninterested in the Limited 146s two tone paint turn signal indicators in the mirrors message center and so forth will be better off getting aftermarket seat heaters installed As in the Windstar the interior front door panels actually rise a few inches above the beltline effectively reducing the side glass area I suspect some market research lay behind this decision Ford continues to offer a second wide angle rearview mirror to keep tabs on the rear seats A useful feature that Toyota has copied On the Road The 4 2 liter 146s 201 peak horsepower trails all the GM vans 146 3 4 liter among extended length minivans but it leads them all in midrange power with 263 pounds feet of torque at a moderate 3650 RPM The extra latch permits the seat to be rotated rearward 90 degrees to serve as a bench for tailgating while the van is parked Unlike in the Nissan the tether used to pull the third row into the well is long enough to extend outside the well This ride quality I suspect that Ford 146s engineers derived their priorities from those of van buyers I drove the Freestar along a road full of chuckholes and very uneven expansion joints The GM vans are less roomy and powerful than the others but despite the oldest chassis here they handle fairly well especially in their short wheelbase variants And the 200 horsepower 3 8 liter V6 has been replaced by two engines a 193 horsepower 3 9 and a 201 horsepower 4 2 both based on the 3 8 Why bother upgrading the 3 8 to a 3 9 One reason might be to suggest that the problematic head gasket blowing 3 8 is history That said how quick does a minivan need to feel From behind the wheel the Freestar feels larger and heavier than the competition partly due to the relatively high instrument panel but also due to the chassis dynamics The pedals in the minivan I drove were adjustable With the pedals all the way back I had to position the seat all the way back even though I 146 m only 5 9 reducing rear passenger room I like an arms outstretched driving position but would likely compromise this when carrying adults in the back The Freestar rides well and has a fairly nice interior but its handling room and seat comfort are at best marginally competitive I cannot not_recommend not_this not_vehicle It doesn 146t look so good Maybe the Limited with more of the stuff will look better Sadly if you want leather you need one of the top trim lines so you 146ll be getting some faux wood with it Aside from this bit of trim the quality of the interior is superior to the Windstar 146 s The list price is 33 230 and the price after discount and rebate to about 28 900 Heated seats and automatic temperature control are only available on the Limited which even after adjusting for major content runs about 850 more The fender flares from the Windstar remain but they look better on the Frestar 146s larger front fender Overall the exterior styling of the Freestar is not not_strikingly not_attractive not_on not_interesting but it appears thoroughly tasteful even somewhat handsome now Later in the model year optional 17 inch alloys will further improve the look of the van judging from the photos in the brochure The split bench in the Toyota is the easiest to stow but the Ford edges out the Honda and the Nissan is by far the most difficult and finger threatening In the Ford unlike in the Honda and Nissan the headrests do not not_have not_to not_be not_removed not_before not_stowing not_the not_seat The controls are conventionally arranged unlike the Nissan there is nothing crazy here Overall the appearance of the Freestar 146s interior is at least mid pack better than the Nissan and GM perhaps a bit nicer than the Honda and trailing only the Toyota and maybe the Chrysler the latter comes across as classy overall but does have some cheap bits Accommodations The Chrysler feels a bit more agile and is roomier the Ford has the trick third row GM offers the least expensive extended minivans once discounts and rebates are taken into account The second row captain 146s chairs feel a little on the small side for adults and are a little too close to the floor to provide good thigh support Luckily these include build in armrests for there is none on the door Get the bench standard on thes SE and SES and I 146 m not not_sure not_what not_passengers not_will not_do not_with not_their not_arms To make the Freestar more comparable to other minivans especially the Honda Odyssey with its very limited feature flexibility I will compare a Windstar SEL with leather power sliding doors side and side curtain airbags traction control stability control and rear obstacle detection The Chrysler has a power passenger seat and power liftgate and its third row does not not_fold not_flat but is otherwise equipped like the Honda Adjusted for equipment it is about 350 less expensive For another 230 you can get a sport suspension complete with automatic leveling a rarity in this class I have not not_tested not_a not_GM not_van not_so not_equipped not_so not_I not_cannot not_evaluate not_this not_option It has curtain airbags fold flat second row captain 146s chairs rear obstacle detection power passenger 146s seat power liftgate adjustable pedals and fixed skylights in back rows but it has no driver 146s side power slider and its automatic has only four speeds It sits low to the floor providing no thigh support and because of very thick sidewalls the left one contains the rear A C the shoulder room in this row is only 51 inches more than a foot less than the second row and about a half foot less than you 146ll find in the rear seat of the typical midsize sedan Notably the Honda Odyssey provides over ten inches more third row shoulder room The Freestar was the only extended minivan I had not not_driven not_I not_expected not_little not_based not_on not_my not_evaluation not_of not_the not_Windstar but was prepared to be surprised I was not not_surprised The upcoming Mazda6 based 147 Futura 148 isn 146t bad But the upcoming large sedan the 147Five Hundred 148 makes no sense to me because there are no other cars whose names are numbers And 147 Freestar 148 what 146s that At least if they name a car 147 Freebird 148 they 146ll have a jingle ready to go Aside from the new name Ford has made a number of changes to its minivan At that point the second row will have no legroom Overall the Freestar 146s rear seating and roominess is very disappointing Compared to the Toyota Sienna it offers 2 2 inches less legroom in the front seats 1 6 inches less in the second row and a huge 6 8 inches less in the third row As moving seats back and forth shifts legroom from row to row these numbers are cumulative for a total legroom disadvantage of over ten inches Those who love every last knick knack should of course get the Limited Note Currently in many regions the 975 package that includes stability control traction control and rear obstacle detection is free on Limiteds and 750 on SELs I have included these discounts in my comparisons The hot van is now the Toyota Sienna The Sienna 146s options are bundled much like the Ford 146s Toyota 146s new system which puts everything into a huge number of packages is very confusing but I waded through the descriptions to find the best one 12 of 21 XLE packages If you

others Unlike the Honda Toyota and top line Nissan however Ford continues to use a four speed automatic Perhaps because its gearing is thus taller than the others or because the revised engine still falls well short of Honda 146s and Toyota 146s in refinement noise quality at full throttle and willingness to rev acceleration with the 4 2 feels just adequate The seats 146 appearance is especially disappointing but leather helps a great deal A fold flat third row is available but only with cloth A Pontiac Montana equipped as closely as possible to the above Ford lists for 31 250 but the typical discount and a 2 500 rebate reduces this to about 26 200 Adjusted for content the GM van is 1 700 less The Odyssey EX L lists for 28 980 Likely because of the increased competition Honda increased prices only 90 from 2003 and its dealers are now discounting these vans but still not not_by not_much not_Edmunds suggests that the typical discount reduces the price to about 28 200 After adjusting for content differences the Honda lacks stability control curtain airbags adjustable pedals and rear obstacle detection but has heated seats and automatic temperature control the Honda is about 200

seats 17 inch wheels power liftgate center console JBL sound system would narrow the gap by about 1 450 Even with a 2 500 price disadvantage 1 650 with the Limited the Toyota still seems the better buy but the Honda is better still The Nissan Quest SL is equipped between the Toyota and the Honda It offers traction control stability control front seat airbags and curtain airbags in all three rows as much safety equipment as can be found on any minivan Topping the others the last as in the Explorer is linked to a rollover sensor and functions as a canopy keeping people from hitting the ceiling in the event of such an accident I doubt many minivans roll over but if one did this would be good to have Pricing The 147 price paid 148 listed below is the sticker price of the van I drove It lists for 30 030 Dealer discounts reduce this to around 29 400 Adjusted for content the Nissan is about 100 more than the Ford The Nissan is a less refined vehicle with inferior interior materials but it has a larger interior many innovative features and striking styling so those who care about such things should check it out In reaction to the Odyssey 146s relatively low prices Chrysler introduced value models of its minivans three years ago A Town Country eX with leather and side airbags lists for 30 500 An old design but still worthy of consideration by those seeking the lowest price and good handling in an extended length van Except for the Toyota Sienna on the high end and the GM vans on the low end all of the extended length minivans are priced within a few hundred dollars of each other

Neg,The gauges are nicely laid out again nothing fancy There is a compass and temperature display with the digital odometer If gas mileage is important to you then dont not_buy not_an not_SUV The quality of the leather is great and the leather wrapped steering wheel feels solid It doesnt have that pick up truck feel that most SUVs have These cosmetic touches are minor but really do make the vehicle look a lot nicer This SUV rides so nicely that I have to remind myself its not not_a not_car When you hit a bump you dont not_bounce not_up not_and not_down not_for not_another not_100 not_yards The CD player is mounted high on the dash which I like above the A C controls The pockets in the doors are spacious and formed so a large water bottle can fit Pretty cool Of course it doesnt ride as nice as a car but it rides MUCH nicer than any SUV ive ever been in before There are 3 cup holders an outlet to plug in a cellphone and a very deep floor console that stores a lot of stuff The audio system sounds awesome and there are a lot of cool settings to change the output to suit different tastes and styles of music The 17 tires really grip and the month long snow storm that just fell where I live put the 4WD to the test and this baby passed with flying colors To me its like a biker complaining about the safety of their motorcycle Anyway before I get off on a rant quality appears to be Job 1 at Ford again The Sport package on the XLT upgrades the tires from 16 to 17 with different aluminum wheels and includes side step boards door handles that match the color of the vehicle and platinum painted cladding and fender moldings Not too big not not_too not_small Some friends have told me that they think the SUV is huge but I remind them that its about a foot shorter in length than a Ford Taurus and the same width and they are always surprised In fact these features are also part of the much higher priced Eddie Bauer package I like the exterior styling of the Explorer Its simple yet tasteful and not not_overly not_done not_with not_cheap not_looking not_plastic not_cladding not_or not_gimmicky not_stuff not_like not_that not_Its not_not not_a not_Hummer and doesnt pretend to be one At first I was a bit skeptical about the 210HP V6 having enough power for an SUV of this size but that thing puts out enough torque to move it nicely and has a surprisingly nice growl to it The size of the vehicle is nice also In general I am very pleased with my Explorer and think it was well worth every penny I cant not_think not_of not_any not_one not_thing not_that not_I not_can not_complain not_about not_As not_I not_mentioned not_the not_gas not_mileage not_isnt not_great not_but not_its not_better not_than not_I not_anticipated not_it not_to not_be not_I not_always not_find not_it not_ridiculous not_when not_SUV not_owners not_complain not_about not_gas not_mileage One exterior feature worth mentioning is the rear hatch Most SUVs have a rear window that flips up in addition to the whole hatch opening Well the Explore has this feature as well but the window plus a portion of the door flips up which makes it easier to put stuff in the back since you dont not_have not_to not_raise not_a not_bag not_of not_groceries not_for not_example not_above not_your not_shoulders not_to not_load not_through not_the not_opening not_I not_am not_extremely not_pleased not_with not_the not_layout not_and not_quality not_of not_the not_materials not_of not_the not_interior About a month ago I purchased a new 2003 Ford Explorer XLT Sport 4 door not not_to not_be not_confused not_with not_the not_2 not_door not_Sport not_Major not_options not_I not_chose not_were not_leather not_moonroof not_and not_a not_6 not_disc not_in not_dash not_CD not_player not_with not_7 not_speakers not_A not_few not_other not_nice not_touches not_that not_came not_with not_it not_are not_the not_auto not_headlamps not_and not_auto not_dimming not_rearview not_mirror not_I not_didnt not_want not_the not_3rd not_row not_seating not_and not_it not_was not_difficult not_to not_locate not_one not_that not_didnt not_have not_it not_but not_my not_dealer not_came not_through not_and not_located not_one not_for not_me not_Id not_rather not_spend not_the not_extra not_cash not_on not_leather not_instead not_of not_a not_3rd not_row not_seat not_thats not_hardly not_ever not_going not_to not_be not_used
Neg,You ll be very happy you did Although ford made several minor improvements I still think this auto is an overpriced piece of garbage I recently wrote a review of the 98 Ford explorer xlt V8 AWD I hate this car which thank god my lease is up this summer I recently rode in a friends 99 explorer XLT V6 AWD It is overpriced underpowered and is generally just a low quality high maintenance SUV I have had many many problems with my explorer and my friend said the same thing Also on top of all the problems their service is terrible I think if you are considering buying this auto look elsewhere I recommend looking at the jeep line or go with an import
Neg,The 1990 model had several flaws We have owned a couple Ford Aerostars From the alternator not not_failing not_to not_a not_leaking not_gas not_tank They are both have rusted out the bottom side panel between the front and rear tires The 1988 van has ran fairly well however the 1990 model has had numerous mechanical problems Many flaws have resulted from the mini vans They also have shakey starters in them as well and a fuel injected engine that will not not_start not_without not_pressing not_the not_gas not_pedal The drivers seat was broken through normal wear and tear The Anti Lock Break notification light has never worked properly yet there was never a recall or anything And the worst aspect of both is that these two and most of these models I have seen are more apt to rust then other vehicles
Neg,The 99 F 150 series appealed to us with a solid build reasonable cost and great looks The good news we only have to keep the truck for three years and the problems are under warranty We were fed up with the cost of repairing our old camper van so we set out to lease a truck We got our new truck off the lot and within the first 14 days the transmission blew Apparently someone hadnt installed a part properly The bad news this truck spends as much time in the shop as our 20 year old camper van its hard to go camping when it breaks down VERY DISAPPOINTING The warning lights came on first but the handbook did not not_direct not_us not_to not_stop not_driving not_just not_recommended not_to not_get not_it not_in not_for not_servicing not_We not_ve not_had not_more not_trouble not_since not_with not_those not_warning not_lights not_coming not_on not_without not_any not_other not_symptoms not_attached

Neg,In 17000 miles I have lost both exhaust manifolds due to leakage I have a 96 F 350 4x4 with 351 eng and C6 Trans The service writer at ford told me that ford has had a problem for years with exhaust manifolds especially on 351 eng her own mid 90s ford developed the same rust problems On yah I was told by the dealer that ford has now fixed the premature problems with exhaust manifolds they do not not_use not_that not_eng not_anymore not_Good not_fix The transmission went out a spark plug rusted into the head and broke off the calipars have stuck causing poor braking the paint white vehicle developes small rust spots on it and mileage is 10 mph at best When I bought the truck I told salesman I was going to use it as a tow vehicle I tow a 3500 lb trailer and this eng trans combination with 4 10 gears has all it can handle Ford must be doing better with the newer super duties
Neg,The car itself has a very bland boring design Thats probably about the only good thing about this car And it cruises with no problem at high speeds I dont not_even not_know not_where not_to not_begin It seemed like everyday there was another problem This car while I had it had so many problems Ok this is pretty much my message STAY AWAY FROM THIS CAR Its not not_worth not_it not_for not_1000 not_treat not_yourself not_to not_a not_vacation not_or not_something not_You not_ll not_definitely not_need not_one not_after not_dealing not_with not_this not_car It actually looks pretty ugly Dont ask me why I got it The interior is very cramped and there are no back seats Problems 1 Leaking winshield and sunroof 2 Car is so loud you cant not_hear not_yourself not_think not_3 First of all to be fair I ll list the good parts about this car its 1 6 liter H O engine does produce a lot of power for a small engine I have actually beaten V8 Chevys and Fords off the line When you turn the vent on all you get is a smell of gasoline 4 Interior smells horrible 5 Handling stinks and power steering squeaks when you turn 6 Shocks and suspension are horrible can feel every bump on the road 7 Horrible gas mileage 15 19 mpg and I thought this was supposed to be an economy car 8 Frequent problem with the engine Overheating burning and leaking oil 9 Car spent more time in the mechanics garage than mine 10 Half the options on the car failed cruise control AC etc
Neg,The car 146s features The radio sounds terrific It makes a huge difference This is a powerful huge truck How the car handles The other 1 3rd seat does the same There are also rear heating ducts The warranty for rust is 5 years That seemed to diminish in time This truck has a seating capacity of 6 people Note though that there is a bump It has a 4 6 liter engine with 8 cylinders It is divided as in 1 3 and 2 3rd The back has cup holders as well and a split bench The second thing I noticed was the outside noise This truck has quite a bit of storage except for the glove compartment This truck is the 2003 4 door SuperCrew XLT 4 Wheel Drive Styleside with an automatic transmission There are no side airbags you may want to note 1F30 22AB0899 39F2CE02 prod3 2001 Hyundai Accent a a href

warranties I have seen 150 at least comparing it to cars There is cloth upholstery and in the car I am driving it is a soft material and in gray The fourth thing I noticed was the steering Considering how big this truck is it handles well It looks nice in white Other colors are black beige red burgundy green dark green gray dark gray silver and a couple of shades of blue The front has a 40 60 split bench front seats which mean that the driver 146s seat is separate from the other two seats which are attached One reason I don 146t like the Chevy is because it is so uncomfortable I found the Ford F150 to be quite comfortable What looks huge is actually tiny once you open it There is storage on the doors and on the roof for glasses and kleenex The front driver 146s seat is also a little longer than the rest of the bench A fantastic feature is lumbar supports for both the driver and the passenger via a round lever It stops just like our Chevy a bit too slowly for me Stepping hard on the brake will stop the truck immediately but just pushing on it will have it come to a slow stop The third thing I noticed was that it didn 146t stop like my BMW OK I know I said I wouldn 146t compare but this is a truck Of course it really didn 146 t I just noticed it less I could for example use my cell phone 146s voice command without being told it was too noisy There are two head rests 2 3rds of the back bench fold down but not not_all the way but enough to get to a place where there is a small holding compartment where the jack is kept It has so many features that are standard there aren

capability which is what we need but other than that I know I 146ll look elsewhere It corners much better than I expected though I did move with the truck For something this size I didn 146t expect

36 8 in from www edmunds com I am driving a white truck In summary I have said many times that if I looked at the crash tests on vehicles I probably wouldn 146t get into one but these letters P poor are glaring Can I not not_recommend not_a not_truck not_based not_on not_that not_alone not_Perhaps but there are other reasons I can 146t recommend it I love the lumbar support though why it is manual I don 146t know when everything is power The first thing I noticed when driving this truck which did not not_go not_away not_with not_time were the bumps I felt I think the truck found every bump on the road or made up some on the way That is a real negative for me because we drive for long periods of time and if we are spending this much money will spend a bit more for a vehicle that will tow and that won 146t get me car sick Then again in my BMW my seat lever is manual in spite of other things being power Among the things mentioned 150 the bumps the noise the fact that the middle person in the front has a bump under their legs does that make it a 5 seater then really the fact that the acceleration isn 146t what I would like nor is the ability to stop and the climb up it will get 3 stars since I like it better than my Chevy which I don 146t recommend either The fifth thing I noticed was the acceleration OK it is a truck but with 8 cylinders I expect more power I had to

Neg,The 3rd row seats are a weak point however So drive within the vehicles limits Engine driveline Three accross seating is acceptable at least for short trips The Expedition is one in a long list of truck based SUVs If you re hauling a lot of gear and people spring for the bigger engine They come in handy when hauling large groups but are best suited for children But who are we kidding You re hauling around babyseats in the back The 2000 models have been improved somewhat with adjustable pedals and improved seat materials but they are still not not_the not_greatest If you are looking for a minivan alternative and need seating for more than 5 the Expedition is a good choice But few other trucks and SUVs are when it comes to smoothness Reliability Safety Ford Expeditions have been fairly reliable When I get the seat set where my legs are happy I cant not_reach not_the not_wheel not_easily But only the most high end cars had them when the Expedition was introduced Expect to see them in the next re design If you re choosing between a less opulently outfitted Expedition and a loaded Explorer choose the Expedition and the cheaper engine Its a much better value The transmission is smooth with none of the lurching ive found on Chyrsler products Its not not_in not_the not_class not_of not_a not_Toyota not_Tundra however This causes major back pain from overreaching And when I get the seat set so my hands feel right my knees feel crowded under the dash The one ive spent time in has zero breakdowns or warranty problems in 38 000 miles I would rank them above Chrysler and GM products though behind Japanese and German makes So is the Expedition really a beached whale Well if you do not not_have not_a not_family or do not not_really not_need not_the not_extra not_space not_there not_are not_some not_newer not_smaller not_better not_driving not_SUVs not_on not_the not_market The new Tahoes have a slight advantage in the on the road experience but I would be wary of their spotty reliablity With the Optional 3rd row seat you can carry 7 on a long trip The 4 6L V 8 is a tad underpowered by modern standards for a vehicle this size but it certainly isnt not_a not_pig not_The not_5 not_4L not_gets not_up not_and not_going not_faster not_but not_adds not_to not_the not_cost not_and not_reduces not_fuel not_mileage not_slightly But if you re like me and others I know and cant not_get not_comfortable not_in not_the not_front not_seats this vehicle is NOT the one for you Its unfortunate because this SUV is a good value for the money Be sure to test drive the Expedition well before buying You may regret it if you cant not_get not_comfortable not_Rear not_seat not_room not_is not_cavernous not_with not_plenty not_of not_room not_to not_put not_in not_car not_seats not_and not_full not_sized not_passengers The problem as with most 3rd row seats is that though they re best suited for small kids its hard to get the very small kids back there and buckled in So again its best for occasional use Buy a minivan if you are always hauling a team around This is a subjective thing but you tend to wallow in turns and it limits your ability to maneuver in emergency situations Braking is adequate though its no sports sedan Part of the safety factor of big SUVs is negated by their inability to maneuver as quickly to actually avoid an accident They will be more nimble and cost less to operate I am very impressed with the new Acura SUV Its slightly more than a loaded Expedition but gives you a better faster ride more refinement Acura warranty and quality and more maneuverability in parking lots Its somewhat smaller but the newer design means more safety features side airbags that somewhat cancel out the Expeditions size advantage If you need the size but want more refinement wait and check out the new Toyota Sequoia Not cheap but resale value will probably be great Some other decent alternatives for those who do and do not not_require

not_Nissan not_Pathfinder The A C and stereo systems are acceptable though nothing special I would suggest aftermarket upgrading if you are an audiophile and skipping the included upgraded CD system Ride handling braking This is never the strong point of an SUV but the Expedition has a smooth ride due to its soft springs and suspension setting Wind noise is acceptable but handling suffers at least on 2wd models due to the excessive body roll My main problem with the interior and this vehicle in general is Fords incredibly uncomfortable seats and seating position I am 6 0 and cannot not_seem not_to not_find not_a not_position not_which not_does not_not not_induce not_severe not_discomfort not_after not_a not_minute not_or not_two not_The not_seat not_back not_is not_too not_hard and there is a lack of proper side bolstering to hold you in when the body rolls in turns and roll it does The dealer network ranks from great to pathetic so ask around to find a good dealer I have two excellent ones in my area Safety is a great reason to pay the extra money to get a full sized SUV rather than a more practical compact 5 000 lbs of bulk and increased ride height goes a long way in protecting your family in a crash Expeditions have not not_been not_tested but the similar F 150 has outstanding crash test results Some of the best around in fact Missing are side and head protection airbags You wont be crusing the boulevard in this SUV Interior Much like the F 150 its functional though it retains some of its truck based look and feel Buttons are large and well placed the guages are easy to read and the center console is huge and very useful Cupholders are fine which is one of my must haves Interior materials are tasteful better than the Chevy Tahoe but there is still a somewhat plasticy look you have to pay 40 000 for an SUV to avoid Its basically a short wheelbase Ford F 150 with a steel roof in back instead of a bed and a rear seat or two So despite their bulk and popular misconception they re actually not not_as not_unwieldy as your typical extended cab pickup is because of the shorter wheelbase Ford also tosses in a few minor luxury features and softens the suspension to differentiate it from the pickup and also to somehow justify the whopping 9 000 price differential Expensive rear seats and roof arent they Here are my impressions on the Expedition Exterior Styling While not not_glamourous not_or not_sexy the styling works Its a bit top heavy due to the cargo maximizing design and the wheels are a bit narrowly offset with more body overhang than Id like
Neg,It looked classy sporty and aggressive at the same time The standard 4 6L has a hard time moving this truck in and out of traffic The 5 4L is powerful and is enough However it is noisy The Ford Expedition I love big Trucks and this one had just come out the year before It is very very roomy expct for people seating in the third row seat but lets not not_be not_too not_demanding The truck bounces you all over the places when turing braking a little hard or drivig on older bumpy roads What I thought was luxury was just a facade Plastic elements are of poor quality and are poorly assembled The expedition is more like an Escargot Third and major disappointment is the ride mainly over bumps holes and the handling in curves Two years ago I had been dreaming about owning one of those monsters I had been seeing on the roads Make sure you ride the Chevy trucks before giving up to the good looks of the Expedition and to the image of driving one Good car hunting It seemed luxurious and safe and so big i loved it we had taken the 5 4 liter V8 whihc I Highly recommend considering the size and weight of this truck This truck just has everyhting on it Awesome 7 speaker stereo power everything 6CD changer turning signal integrated in the mirrors for aded safety lit running board third row seat automatic lights leater seats power driver seat etc You might not not_realize not_it not_as not_a not_driver not_but not_seat not_on not_the not_right not_side not_a not_few not_times and it ll become obvious I was wondering why my wife kept comlaining about my driving So I went SUV shopping I drove the Durango the Isuzu and many others Many but the Tahoe I cannot not_tell not_you not_why not_Maybe not_it not_was not_just not_the not_shape not_of not_it not_it not_looked not_old When you pus the pedal down the cabin fills with noise and it is quite disppointing for 36 k luxuary car After driving this truck for a year and driving other cars and SUVS I quikcly became more and more disappointed They had remaind he same for years a big rectangular box on wheels Well I ended up leasing a brand new 98 Eddie Bauer Ford Expedition I live in the South East where it never snows and I dont not_have not_time not_to not_go not_off not_road so I decided to save money but getting the 2WD There are too many large gaps betwee dashboard elements and doors etc Second disappointment after the excitment of buying the Expedition was gone was the lack of torque and power Drive an expdition then a Tahoe and you ll understand what i am talking about The Chevy powerplant is a lot more powerful and efficient it ll let you spin the wheels at a red light It also tends to lie on its side when turning A 36 0000 dollar luxury SUV should not not_bounce not_you not_so not_bad not_and not_force not_you not_to not_hold not_on not_tight not_ot not_the not_door not_handle not_and not_the not_dash not_board not_unless not_you not_wnat not_a not_work not_out not_i not_do not_not not_feel not_as not_safe not_driving not_it not_now not_I not_have not_since not_driven not_a not_TAHOE not_and not_ridden not_in not_a not_SUBURBAN not_the not_engine not_is not_a not_lot not_more not_powerful not_and not_adequate not_for not_such not_a not_car not_and not_the not_ride not_is not_a not_lot not_more not_comfortable not_Finally not_I not_will not_end not_saying not_that not_in not_a not_year not_I not_had not_to not_take not_my not_Brand not_New not_36 not_k not_Expediiton not_to not_the not_shop not_twice not_thre not_parts not_broke not_in not_the not_sunroof not_10 not_days not_without not_a not_car not_and not_the not_Auto not_Air not_Valve not_broke
Neg,It shifts very smoothly The Expedition does drive nicely But I have also driven it many times We need the large car to travel to our soccer games and tournaments The back windows dont not_go not_down not_all not_the not_way not_They not_go not_too not_low not_to not_be not_for not_child not_safety My family got the car because we have 6 people all of whom are involved in soccer The seats are rather hard and uncomfortable I have a Jeep Grand Cherokee which has extremely comfortable seats and the transition to the Expedition is not not_a not_good not_one There is never room to put all of our bags Another problem is that when the seats are put down they dont not_align not_properly It has average gas mileage and is relatively smooth riding Except once when it hydroplaned on the interstate not not_good at all All together I would not not_recommend not_the not_Expedition If you have a car that is made to hold 8 people there needs to be room to put all of their things The Ford Expedition is supposed to be a top of the notch vehicle however there are many little things that just bring down the whole vehicle First of all there is no trunk space You cant not_put not_your not_arms not_out not_of not_the not_window and they get an annoying dirt line on them that is hard to get rid of If you havent noticed im speaking from the passengers point of view On long trips it is so nice to be able to put down the seats and make it into a bed But since the seats are uneven the bed is very uncomfortable Another problem that just irks me is the windows If you are buying as a car that you would like to be comfortable for your passengers as I assume you are since you are buying a car made for eight I would recommend something more like a Suburban
Neg,MY family has leased a 1998 Ford Expedition Eddie Bauer Version for 3 years now There are several pluses to this car though 1 No one will ever cut you off or get in your way and i mean never 2 Very safe in crashes 3 Good in wintry conditions such as snow but bad in ice since there is such a high center of gravity 4 Seats 8 5 Lots of storage space 6 Fairly nice sound system 7 We have been fairly happy with it considering there are 3 kids and 2 adults WE have had more than our fair share of problems with this truck which i will explain later on This car is best used on the highway considering it gets horrible gas mileage in the city and its still not not_that not_great on the highway I would suggest leasing this car instead of just plain buying it becuase you dont not_want not_to not_buy not_this not_car not_and not_turn not_around not_and not_hate not_it not_like not_lots not_of not_people not_i not_know They are very inexpensive at the dealerships right now 8 Removeable back seat Now for the not not_so not_good things 1 Insurance is sky high 2 Horrible gas mileage 3 Tons of mechanical problems 4 Loud 5 Drinks fall out of cup holders 6 Antena gets scratched if you go in your garage so in about a year you have to spend money to get a new antena 7 Vary hard to park 8 Bad turning radius 9 Possibility to flip over 10 cd player is in center counsol so you cant not_change not_cds not_or not_anything not_while not_driving not_11 not_Hard not_to not_wash not_12 not_Very not_expensive not_to not_get not_repainted not_or not_get not_fixed not_Now not_for not_the not_problems not_we not_had not_1 not_Windows not_got not_stuck and would not not_come not_up not_all not_the not_time not_during not_the not_summer not_2 not_Oil not_leaks not_constantly not_3 not_Winshield not_wipers not_wear not_out not_in not_about not_4 not_months not_4 not_Paint not_peeled not_5 not_Tons not_of not_problems not_with not_our not_fule not_pump not_6 not_Leather not_on not_seats not_tor not_for not_no not_reason not_7 not_Winshield not_wiper not_on not_back not_window not_never not_worked and never will I suggest getting a smaller suv such as a cherokee or explorer

Neg,The big SUVs are supposedly pimpin cars They are hogs of the road It is very roomy and you can fit like 7 people in it comfortably Well when you look at them yeah they are very nice in a monsterous way When my friends started to find out I was driving an expedition they all called me big pimpin Shawn Cause The worst part of the car is its amazing ineffeciency with gas I end up never useing the air conditioner because the amount of money im spending on gas is just so ludicrous And it is taking its toll on me I live in southern California where the temperatures are soaring into unbearable levels I cant not_complain not_about not_the not_amount not_of not_space not_the not_car not_has They need one of those signs on it that says oversized load I dont not_like not_driving not_it not_cause not_its not_just not_too not_big not_I always park it as far away from the other cars at parking lots cause im afraid I might not not_be not_able not_to not_get not_out not_of not_the not_car not_or not_worse not_yet not_not not_able not_to not_back not_it not_out not_of not_the not_parking not_spot This is defenitly a plus when your the designated driver at a pary or something of importance like that If you have no need for the very large amount of space this car has DO NOT PURCHASE IT however if you have to move around a bunch of kids every day or you need a very large carpool THIS IS THE CAR FOR YOU
Neg,But we didnt It got worse That was a deal That could effect the transmission etc There was also a vibration with it too They didnt not_have not_any not_convertibles not_on not_display not_only not_hard not_tops We felt it was a fluke that we had problems with the first Mustang They did give me 1200 back for the extended warentee but they let us keep the warentee We had the car for 15 months and a humming in the middle to rear of the car started So we had it towed to the dealership and they were closed but when they looked at the car they told us we did something to make this happen The second Mustang we did eventually have problems with the torque converter but the dealer said there was nothing wrong with it Thats another story See my write up about it and my 2000 GT Penny we paid for the car I was thankful for that I felt FORD made it good so I used all that money and ordered a new 1998 Mustang convertible laserred 6 cylinder They had the car for almost a month and a factory rep came down to look at it and there was a factory defect in the engine which caused the engine to blow I wanted my money back and they said NO A new 21 000 car and a blown engine We took it in many times anf finally I found out there was a defect in the torque converters and Ford was keeping it hush hush because they didnt not_have not_enough not_torque not_converters not_to not_replace not_it not_on not_all not_the not_cars not_I not_didnt not_want not_the not_car not_Luckily not_we not_live not_in not_Florida not_with not_the not_Lemon not_Law and we got back EVERY We used to drive down the road and be jealous of all the people who were driving the NEW style Mustang so when we could afford one we bought it It was sitting in the back lot it was white and all the dirt had settled on it from sitting With the shortage of mustangs around we were thrilled to find one but we couldnt figure out why it wasnt not_on not_the not_showroom not_floor It seems that South Florida is the place for convertibles year round and thats what we wanted 21 000 later we had BRAND NEW Mustang convertible 6 cylinder white top and white paint grey interior and 350 miles on it when we drove it off the lot We were thrilled it was our Christmas present Eight days after we purchased our NEW car it was a rainy New Years eve and I saw the car parked by the school 4 miles from home and nobody was in it I thought someone had stolen it A policeman drove by asking why the car was there he thought it was stolen Walking in the rain was my son and he said the car let out with a bunch of steam and the engine quit
Neg,My roomate recently bought a 2000 Ford Explorer Sport The back hatch or 3rd door is nice but really heavy They usually have you in the system by then They hurt pretty bad when you sit on them It starts to get very hard and annoying to close the doors At least the child is small enough to where they dont not_sit not_on not_them The SUV is really nice but it is too bumpy and can flip very easily The front seats arent very comfortable and the back seat is awful I feel like im sitting on a big pile of wood The body of the SUV is really nice but not not_nice not_enough not_for not_me not_to not_own not_one not_I not_ll not_have not_to not_stick not_with not_the not_Chevy not_Tahoe not_in not_this not_category If you are going to have 3 people in the back make sure one of them is a kid so they can sit in between the seatbelts in the middle of the seat If you own and know about the free oil changes that you can purchase for 2 or 3 years have all your paperwork with you the first and second time you go to the dealership to have it done If you are a woman you will probably have to use two hands to pull it down to close it Now for the side doors after a few months of opening and closing the doors they get to where you have to slam them shut If you dont and Ford doesnt have you in the system or says that they have never heard of that before you will end up paying for it and fighting with Ford to get your money back for that oil change After 1 or 2 times it gets better
Neg,They are taking lessons Their loved ones are long gone The public the consumers are watching The battle of the cream of the creams The victims have filed lawsuits in the meantime What has been known in this conflict a He admits that this company is prone to rollovers They have already paid with the blood of their loved ones In what ways will this public battle benefit regular poor and suffering consumers This may explain why he is asking for an inquiry We need more people like him around Dont you agree This news is nothing but positive for the consumers and the plaintiffs of various lawsuits How about consumers safety in all of this i Ford Motor Co CEO fires back They are suffering while they recover from last years flurry of peeling tires accidents He has taken steps making sure the proceedings get under way i All of this has come after numerous fatal accidents and recalls of tires by both companies As far as the tires are concerned lets hope that more whistle blowers come out like Erin Brokovich Who would not not_jump not_on not_them not_c not_Important not_features not_despite not_all not_the not_rumors not_Ford not_Explorer not_has not_been not_a not_best not_seller You may even want to call the breakup of relationship a divorce of Ford Motor Co from Bridgestone Firestone No camp appears to take the blame for the lack of safety and the shredding and peeling of tires in last years series of accidents The 2001 Ford Explorer comes with air bag driver air bad passenger side impact door beams theft deterrent system window driver side Express door etc and all the standard features It is said that Alan Hogan has been the Erin Brokovich in this case May he continue to serve society and the regular Joes with his moral values For sure the battle has intensified Still the questions that most consumers are asking are How safe is the Explorer How safe are the tires May the truth come out This way if any defect is found in the vehicle it may be corrected to save lives on the roads We have come to the conclusion that we can no longer supply tires to Ford since the basic foundation of our relationship has been seriously eroded Which side to believe At that point Mr Lampe met with transportation secretary Norman Mineta and submitted to him a pretty long report about Ford Explorers steering problem that may have contributed to rollovers Ford is blaming on defective tires It has already made plans to replace the Firestone Wilderness AT tires by signing a contract with Goodyear All of this news leaves John Lampe with no other alternatives other than to ask for an inquiry of the Ford Explorer So much for the 95 year relationship that saw the marriage of blood and flesh over the years Plaintiffs of lawsuits filed against both companies are paying close attention to the tidbits of info that fall on their laps Disclaimer i Attempts at a detailed analysis based on the intensifiction of the fight between the two giants Call this bitter battle between these two giant companies whatever you want Call it the battle of the sturdy CEOs Lampe and Nasser John and Jacques We are deeply disappointed that Firestone decided not not_work not_together not_for not_the not_safety not_of not_our not_shared not_customers not_which not_is not_the not_only not_issue not_that not_matters not_Despite not_all not_the not_shots not_fired not_back not_and not_forth not_consumers not_become not_spectators not_of not_this not_major not_disagreement We all know how last Summer Bridgestone Firestone agreed to recall 6 5 million tires that the government linked to the previous deaths Ford has a lot of ammunition against Firestone And Firestone has a lot against Ford too The federal government has files linking Bridgestone Firestone to 174 deaths and more than 700 injuries Based on these data it appears that Firestone had no other games to play other than to be forthcoming and cooperative to save its skin It is one of the Fords lines of vehicles that has had some great returns over the years Most consumers continue to buy them despite the existence of its competitors as found in GMC Jimmy Chevrolet Blazer Jeep Cherokee 2WD and Jeep Cherokee 4WD One of the protaganists seems to say something that includes the consumers whose heart money and business both camps are looking for There may be some grain of truth to this statement by Bridgestone Firestone president John Lampe Business relationships like personal ones are built upon trust and mutual respect They want to know which side is truly interested in protecting them giving them the assurance of safety on the roads After all they are the ones who buy the various Ford Explorers on which the Firestone tires were mounted Jacques Nasser decides to recall close to 13 million more Firestone tires on its SUVs If anything wrong is found in the Ford Explorer design they will be able to use this new information against Ford On the other hand Ford CEO Jacques Nasser wants to continue believing that all the problems lie with the tire manufacturer John Lampe does not not_understand not_why not_his not_companys not_tires not_fair not_well not_in not_other not_vehicles not_but not_not not_on not_Ford not_Explorer While this breakup may be a catalyst to many plaintiffs lawyers grin what remains to establish to end all doubt is whether Ford Explorer is all that its cranked out to be It will be up to the inquiry team to answer this question John Lampe cant not_answer not_it not_himself Lets hope that the truth the whole truth will come out without any problems
Neg,Not only was it always broken down but it also was terrible on the gas mileage My 1995 Ford Explorer Sport was my favorite vehicle that ive owned when it was running The things that I liked about this SUV is that it is very roomy and handles very well These are about the only things that I liked Every month I had a problem with it everywhere from that cooling system to the transmition Nothing but problems The two other cars that I have had for an extended period of time were a Toyota pickup and the car I have now is an Altima I havent had a problem with either of these vehicles notice that they are both foriegn cars I would not not_encourage not_anyone not_to not_purchase not_the not_1995 not_Ford not_Explorer not_Sport not_unless not_given not_to not_you not_or not_you have too much money and you want to use it on repairs
Neg,My doors dropped because the hinges were made so poorly The vehicle is very attractive looking roomy quite comfortable and not not_that not_bad on gas BUT the construction is extremely poor When I take the vehicle out of 4 wheel drive I am instructed to back up a bit to totally disengage the hubs The inside door panel and handle construction is so poor that my handles actually broke off just from regular use which in turn caused my inside door panels to crack split and then break altogether I have a Ford Explorer Sport and I know I am going to get some flack for writing this epinion but I feel I must voice my epinion anyway I have read many other epinions about the Ford Explorer and many people seem to love this SUV I however would never ever buy another one I have 4 years left to pay on the piece of junk and wish I had never bought it If I could get out from underneath it I would in a heartbeat I would not not_recommend not_the not_purchase not_of not_and not_Explorer not_to not_anyone and would never consider buying one again I have dubbed mine the Ford Exploder I consider it one of the worst vehicles I have ever owned What is that I dont not_see not_other not_people not_backing not_up not_all not_over not_the not_place not_to not_do not_that not_This not_cant not_be not_right but if I dont not_back not_up not_I not_hear not_crunching not_and not_grinding and I dont not_dare not_drive not_it not_What not_a not_poor not_system not_I not_was not_told not_by not_the not_service not_department not_that not_this not_was not_normal not_for not_the not_Ford not_Explorer not_though not_and not_that not_I not_need not_to not_backup not_My not_ABS not_system doesnt work properly either and I have had times when I wasnt not_sure not_I not_was not_going not_to not_be not_able not_to not_stop not_for not_school not_buses not_and not_such not_I not_found not_this not_to not_be not_a not_very not_scary not_experience not_Now not_I not_get not_a not_recall not_card not_in not_the not_mail not_saying not_the not_rear not_door not_hatch not_hinges not_are not_poorly not_constructed and could be dangerous NO KIDDING
Neg,He told me that the problem could not not_be not_fixed not_as not_it not_is not_under not_investigation not_by not_Ford In March 1999 I decided to buy a Ford Explorer Sport after thoroughly researching information on suvs in my price range When the dealer fixed it they in turn screwed up the back wiper so I had to take it back in im glad I wasnt not_driving not_at not_the not_time They dont not_know not_whats not_causing not_the not_problem and until they do they dont not_know not_how not_to not_repair not_it not_Once not_they not_figure not_it not_out not_they not_will not_be not_sending not_out not_another not_recall It sputters then very quickly accelerates when taking off from a stop or backing up and the transmission feels like its slipping When I picked up the vehicle I had to go to the service person and ask them to explain the receipt Then I got the recall for the secondary hood latch then a recall for the cruise control then a recall for the windshield wiper blades because they would swish back and forth when you used the turn signal and sometimes even when you didnt not_use not_the not_turn not_signal not_Last not_week not_I not_had not_to not_take not_the not_vehicle not_in not_because not_its not_running not_rough That means I have to drive this vehicle with it running the way it is until then Its embarrassing to be in this V6 SOHC vehicle and have it sputter so bad you can hardly back out of a parking space then have it catch and fly out of that space I dont not_think not_anyone not_should not_buy not_this not_vehicle For the first month I truly enjoyed my new car I like the power it has but not not_the not_gas not_it not_uses but I knew it wouldnt not_get not_good not_gas not_mileage and I was okay with that But what I hate about this vehicle is how many recalls it has had already among the other problems ive had with it One month after I bought the vehicle the back window shattered out while it was sitting in the carport

Neg,The dealership did not not_want not_to not_fix not_this not_saying not_that not_it not_was not_my not_fault In August of 1997 I Russell turned the age of 16 My parents told me I could have any car that was available to my choices on the lot no special oredering my dad said So as a 16 year old getting his first car a new one at that I was very estatic to look at my options I knew that I either wanted a mustang or an explorer Well my decision was made The explorer was mine After about 3 months of having my SUV my check engine light decided to come on As soon as that happend no more than 2 hours later i took it to the dealership and it took them 2 weeks to fix it It needed a tune up already Well in mid March my Mach 460 radio system factory blew And needless to say my sunroof stopped working my leather seats started to tear and keep in mind I kept very good care of this car VERY GOOD she was my baby I do not not_think not_i not_liked not_anything not_about not_this not_car not_after not_having not_it not_for not_a not_year and a half Driving this car was an unbelievalbe experience Everybody where I live wanted to drive it It was easy on the handling very aggresive and super fast If you think that this was just a lemon then buy one on my opinion i have 3 other friends that just have gotten new ones in the past year and they have done the same I would not not_recomend not_this not_vehicle not_to not_my not_worst not_enemy not_Now however Ford has come out with the Ford Explorer Sport Trac this car is better by far I have had mine for about 3 months now and she has gave me NO problems at all I recommend the Ford Explorer Sport Trac NOT the Ford Explorer Sport
Neg,The stereo sucks 5 The fold down rear seats are a very smart design And they have not not_cooperated not_or not_tried not_to not_undo not_the not_situation not_since My dealer was fast and gave us what we wanted quickly 2 My experience thus far with Ford and my Ford Explorer Sport has been subpar Reviewing an automobile We got a surprise delivery of two very nice folding directors chairs with the Ford Outfitters logo that we use regularly Id like to take the more Consumer Reports approach and just list the good things and the bad things ive experienced since January 2000 Good 1 It was a nice touch especially with them not not_even telling us about the gift 3 Its a comfortable car with effective air conditioning and practical seating So we are in effect paying interest on an 1800 dollar warranty we asked not not_to not_have not_That not_was not_a not_major not_downer not_4 Ok the bad 1 It was a bit overpriced for what I got ive driven a Jeep Cherokee before this with the old body style and it was much cheaper and practical 2 We specifically asked not not_to not_receive not_their not_special not_warranty but the creditors charged us anyway and when we asked for a refund they simply applied the 1800 dollars toward the END of our loan The suspension sucks 6 Its value has already depreciated significantly from the time of purchase and we are already after 5 months well into negative equity Its my first Ford And probably my last for a long time The gas mileage is totally horrendous I have yet to obtain the average mileage advertised on the window summary at the dealer Very bad times to be driving gas guzzlers Again something the Cherokee was much more efficient in 3 Ford Credit has been very crooked
Neg,It was the transmission I had to have it towed to a local transmission garage They didnt not_care not_that not_I not_had not_proof not_that not_I not_properly not_maintained not_my not_vehicle not_because not_a not_Ford not_mechanic not_didnt not_do not_the not_maintenance No one at Ford cared or would listen to me I told the transmission mechanic to fix it quick to get it going I bought my first new car in 1994 After many test drives of other SUVs I chose a brand new Ford Explorer Sport I had it custom made and bought an extended warranty 75 000 miles or 4 years They told me it would cost at least 1 000 to just get it going not not_including not_anything not_else not_to not_do not_it not_right not_I not_called not_Ford and they wouldnt not_even not_listen not_to not_me After a year I started to have problems I cant not_remember not_all not_the not_problems not_mostly not_brakes not_Every not_time not_I not_brought not_it not_in not_I not_had not_to not_pay not_a not_50 not_dollar not_deductible not_even not_though not_I not_had not_a not_warranty They said my Warranty expired 3 000 miles ago nothing we can do I had just paid off the vehicle 3 months before and I was stuck with a piece of junk I also have to say my tires lasted longer than the transmission I just replaced the tires for the first time a few weeks before It cost me 1 000 to get rid of it I traded it in for a Honda Civic and havent had one problem with it in two years and my warranty has no deductible I am currently looking for another SUV My employer is currently advertising any Ford vehicle for purchase over 4 dealer invoice Even with this incentive I will never purchase another Ford again I can only recommend this vehicle if you have the money for all of the repairs or you buy an extended warranty without a deductible and trade it in before your warranty expires It was always something I brought my vehicle to a reputable garage in town every 3 000 miles to have the oil changed and I went by the book with all the maintenance that was needed Ford gave me a book with maintenance checklists I never failed to miss a 3 000 mile maintenance I even had the tires rotated when I brought the vehicle in for a oil change I had the book checked and signed by the mechanic before I left I never beat on the vehicle or drove it recklessly I was at 78 000 in August 1997 I was in town and the vehicle died
Neg,This left the car at the dealership for almost two weeks New grill body cladding and white gauges cant not_hide not_a not_rigid not_rear not_suspension not_poor not_gas not_mileage not_and not_some not_old not_demons not_such not_as not_poor not_build not_quality not_Engine The dealer experience was so bad that this will be my last Ford since ive been driving Fords in 1985 The transmission problem lead to major arguments with the dealer Ford Customer Relations and the service manager Dealer support Um non existent As mentioned above the transmission failed right in the middle of traffic and it took almost 2 weeks to have it replaced The problem areas had to be escalated to Ford Customer Relations to resolve Because the Explorer Sport ended up being serviced for over 30 days I qualified for the California Lemon Law and I eventually moved to a Ford Escape The dealer told me that the 4 0 V6 in the Explorer was the German built powerplant designed to lower emission levels Very smooth but very thirsty Transmission Mated to this German powerplant was this new French transmission After 2 months this transmission failed and had to be replaced Most car manufacturers have a line of cars that are highly profitable because they have not not_had not_to not_change not_them not_in not_years not_A not_few not_cosmetic not_upgrades not_here not_and not_there and the vehicle is launched as a new model year The Explorer has been around for over a decade and the 2001 Explorer Sport is the most modern interpretation of this old platform The flip side of this was that I had a nice little Focus to drive Interior Wonderful seats and a nice update to the standard Explorer interior including white gauges and faux brushed metal door handles Every piece seemed to be made from quality materials However in the 2 door Sport model the front passenger seat was difficult to slide back to allow access to the rear seats Very strange given the wonderful 2 door mechanism there was in a Ford Probe I used to have the front passenger seat would slide out of the way This would have been a nice feature in the Explorer Sport Nice touches include the puddle lamps off the mirrors Problem areas Rear fixed window leaked and had to be rebeaded and replaced Rear windshield wiper motor failed Matte finish of the front door arm rests wore off in just 3 months Ancient rear suspension meant very bad handling in parking lots over bumps
Neg,The ride is very bumpy it feels like sitting on wood It has very rough bumpy ride Does it really worth 30 000 please think again You may think that a new design will improve the previous design not not_necessary not_with not_2001 not_Explorer The engine sounds like a tractor trailer and cornering is a disaster I felt very unsafe driving without the seat belt because I was sliding all over the place Front seats are so so but rear seats are very uncomfortable The only change is the head and tail light I went to the dealer with a very positive attitude to test drive the new Explorer Was I impressed when I left not not_at not_all not_the not_same not_opinion not_as not_last not_model You ll think that after all the complaints that people made about seat comfort that Ford will make some improvement but unfortunatlly they did not not_and not_2001 not_model is the same as previous except for little minor changes Ford Explorer does not not_have not_the not_car not_like not_ride not_as not_Nissan not_Pathfinder not_Toyota not_4 not_Runner not_or not_Grand not_cherokee
Neg,This times its a wee bit worse than before one of the heads has cracked and will need to be replaced And for the next few years it kept it up never could get fixed until the truck was traded in for a Toyota Camry I always wanted a truck especially after owning a little ol station wagon for many years I wanted to go big but could only afford small and ended up with a 90 Ford Ranger 4x4 XLT So the next day I drive from Southern Oregon to Seattle a good 600 mile trip Truck drives fine though the whole way im scared out of my gord its gonna die again and alas 10 miles from my final destination it does It was really one bad problem that made driving the truck a chore and kept me from being happy to own it and with the other problems ive seen Ford drivers have I dont not_think not_you not_ll not_see not_me not_behind not_a not_Ford not_wheel not_ever not_again This is done and after a few hundred bucks down the drain I come to find out not not_only one head is cracked but BOTH heads were cracked and the other would need to be replaced More money both heads fixed phew Except now my engine is loud with a constant ticking noise that just wont stop At the time of purchase and for the next few years it was the greatest truck in the world Got me where I needed to go and took everything else with it The extended cab was perfect to toss bags or anything else in and also housed a little bazooka tube for some extra thump when I wanted to turn the music up The V6 Engine gave me a nice ride though it was a bit underpowered compared to what I drive now And it turned out to be this engine that would cause me all the pain and suffering in the world a truck can cause you It started innocently enough when my car suddenly overheated and stopped in the middle of the freeway one day Pushing my car into the Temsco I was told it was simply a leak in the radiator fluid line which it was and I was told they d fixed it which they hadnt
Neg,It has independent front and rear suspension There are two V8 engine options for the 2003 Expedition This engine can tow up to 8 900 lbs Wednesday night who goes out on a Wednesday night In short I got to drive a 2003 Expedition The steering wheel is beige but the background is black creating a strange mismatched feeling The gauges are standard black background with back light Again this is bland old styling An optional feature that proves the Expeditions minivan likeness is DVD rear seat entertainment center Theres a large gap between the climate control panel and the stereo of just black plastic Theres this reggae party that happens at one of the beach front hotels in my area This is an improvement but the gas mileage is between 13 18 to 13 17 depending on 4WD It offers 7 screen that folds down from the ceiling and a control panel with headphone jacks When it was first mentioned in 2000 I think the targeted release date was in 2003 The first is the standard SOHC 2 Valve 4 6 liter V8 with 232 hp and 291 lbs of torque at 3 450 rpm The leather is comfortable but gets very hot in the sun may want to consider a seat cover for the summer The 2nd engine is the optional SOHC 2 Valve 5 4 liter V8 with 260 hp and 350 lbs of torque at 2 500 rpm The Expedition is 205 8 inches or 17 15 feet long 78 7 inches or 6 5 feet wide 77 6 or 6 46 feet tall But it was almost too quiet I found myself getting sleepy maybe boredom played a role in this as well One thing mentioned in the ads is a Safe Canopy System with roll over sensor The overall handling was a little mushy because it felt like the body was reluctant to turn with the wheel making tight turns a challenge This system does not not_cover not_the not_3rd not_row not_of not_seats not_kind not_of not_cheesy It would be nice if they used a white background instead like the Escape or even get a little crazy with the new metallic tones such as the Matrix Vibe duo But some of the people are interesting to look at like that little hippie looking guy with a camel toe and a belt buckle bigger than his head So much so that Ford had to cut manufacturing in half about a year and a half ago Like GM Ford has a large selection in SUVs and SUV like trucks The Expedition introduced as a 1997 model is the 2nd flagship to Fords high profit SUV line that lead Ford to introduce the Excursion which is still struggling But I would still like to see some metallic orange tones and maybe a dark plum purple CON Overall the looks are bland lacking the ability to turn heads but clean The 2002 model did very well in the government crash test ratings however the close relative the F 150 did horribly in the IIHS tests But in a market flooded with costly SUVs constantly being shoved down consumers throats consumers are now starting to choke on the high gas prices and cost of ownership What the heck is that Well its an optional safety feature thats basically a wall of side airbags lining the 1st and 2nd row of seats The power controls are located on the door armrest area and were easy to reach but did not not_get not_in not_the not_way not_The not_captains not_chair not_for not_the not_drivers not_seat not_is not_nice not_offering not_an not_armrest not_on not_either not_side If you re going to advertise such a complex safety system for a so called large family vehicle make sure it protects all passengers The success of the 2003 Expedition is very important for Ford and their recovery after last years 5 45 billion dollar profit loss proving that not not_all consumers need 5500 lb gas guzzlers that is unless you re a soccer mom It has a ground clearance of 8 9 inches and weighs in somewhere around 5 600 lbs depending on the engine and if its 2WD or 4WD Color options for the Eddie Bauer Edition include white dark green black light green red and dark blue The climate control vents are large and round and the AC seems to cool down the cabin fairly quick considering the size Both the 2nd and 3rd row of seats fold down creating 110 cubic feet of storage CON But the seats only fold down they cant not_come not_out not_so not_they not_re not_still not_there not_taking not_up not_space not_Most not_minivans not_have not_an not_advantage not_in not_that not_aspect not_because not_both not_rows not_of not_seats not_can not_be not_removed not_creating not_more not_storage not_space Because this is so new its too soon to get crash test ratings on it I would assume Ford would only improve from the 2002 model Warranty The looks are nothing to get excited about power is mediocre while gas mileage is poor and space seating capacity are average The gas tank capacity is 28 gallons giving you 394 miles to 532 miles to a tank depending on engine type and city of highway driving and can cost between 45 to 60 or more to fill up the tank depending on gas prices in your area CON The Reason Selling a utility vehicle is cheaper for a manufacturer is because there is 33 mileage and emission standards required The storage space isnt not_bad not_but not_not not_good not_compared not_to not_many not_minivans not_The not_Toyota not_Sienna not_has not_133 not_4 not_cubic not_feet not_the not_Honda not_Odyssey not_has not_146 not_1 not_cubic not_feet and finally the Kia Sedona has 127 5 cubic feet of storage with the seats removed all more than the large Expedition But that seems to have faded possibly due to profit loss But if Ford can produce a mainstream SUV with a hybrid engine I think it would give them the market edge they need to recover the lost profit and change the standards for SUVs However consumers are the ones reamed with the extra fuel costs but the manufacturers are saving money and thats whats important right Or how about that screaming lady who forgot a bra that the bouncers are escorting out Hmm have another beer im glad I didnt not_drink because my fianc friends did Whats scary is one of them owns a 2003 Expedition and felt he could drive it home One safety concern about SUVs minivans and any vehicle with open storage area in the cabin is in the event of a bad accident any large items in the cabin such as a cooler groceries supplies for a beach trip or a sheet of wood can hit passengers and cause injuries or worse Wow almost 7 years and it hasnt changed much Because its a beach party that involves cheap alcohol it can be pretty amusing But something about sitting outside when its like 800 degrees and the food selection is limited to picked though chicken wings ripe cheese squares and crackers doesnt really make me want to drink As an answer to the now outdated SUV craze we are starting to see a lot of these over powered utility vehicles that are being shoved down consumers throats with high price tags through extreme advertising The problem The comment section is open 6 25 02 I came across this article thats rather disturbing today http www thecarconnection com index asp article 5020 Other vehicles to consider Honda Odyssey In that aspect someone needs to tell Ford we re moving forward not not_backwards in technology I Handling Handling is one of the major improvements in the next generation Expedition and I will say its quite an improvement Road noise and wind shear seem to be non existent Its a quiet ride unless you have the stereo cranked The power steering was very easy and somewhat responsive and the brakes seem to work well But dont not_take not_that not_for not_granted not_something not_of not_this not_size not_and not_weight has a lot longer stopping distance than a car I dont not_recommend not_tailgating not_anybody not_in not_this because you may not not_have not_enough not_time not_to not_stop not_if not_they not_slam not_on not_the not_brakes So if your in the habit of driving with a lot of stuff in the car all the time you may want to rethink that or look into putting some kind of wall or separating barrier between it and the cabin thats strong and will not not_come not_loose not_easily Has more styling looks more versatile space better gas mileage great crash test ratings will seat 7 is cheaper and can even tow up to 3 500 lbs Ford Focus Wagon A interesting feature but im sure parents will agree that if this kind of entertainment is needed a Gameboy or two is much cheaper and portable Other optional features include Safe canopy system tire pressure sensing power fold down 3rd seat climate controlled front seats Eddie Bauer only 4WD 2nd row captains chairs power fold 3rd row seats front hooks with 4WD only and moonroof I Safety There is no silver option yet and I prefer silver but thats just me But you d think it would be an option because its a basic color Color options for the XLT model include a plain beige tan dark green black dark gray light green red blue while silver and light blue All are plain everyday colors but I suppose it would look a little funny in bright yellow aqua or even the iridescent blue Honda offers An optional feature is the 3rd row of seats can powered down by using switch in the back reached when the back is opened up im not not_sure thats really helpful and I wonder how that can go wrong in the future I would rather the seats be removable to open more space than powered down I Engines Not for efficient family sedans or compact cars because Ford does not not_make not_a not_lot not_of not_profit not_on not_those not_I

looks like SUVs have taken over the reputation the minivan once had One of the main selling points for the redesigned Expedition is it handles much better off road and is not not_as not_soft and GMs Tahoe Yukon line I wanted to find out who the Expedition is really targeted to and how much it really improved over its predecessor I Exterior The gas mileage is a major gripe about the Expedition no improvements here I realize something of this size needs power but its insulting when a V6 minivan that gets about 25 MPG can hold as much or more than the 2003 Expedition About 3 years ago Ford was making noises about a hybrid 200 hp V6 engine that gets around 40 MPG and possibly a V8 version with the new hybrid technology Has lots of cargo space head room good looks good gas mileage American brand is cheaper and comfortably seats 5 Honda Pilot Cheaper smaller better gas mileage seats 8 tows up to 4 500 lbs and has more head room Thanks for reading It gets a 2 star rating As stated in my Avalanche review my major complaint goes something like this The newest Expedition is another Ford contribution to the SUV Truck power craze that has brought dreams of big bucks to the big Detroit three and I must say im not not_impressed At first glance I mistook it for the 2002 Explorer the Expedition looks very identical to it with the same front grill headlights bumper trims and overall body shape Maybe this helped Ford save money on the redesign im wondering why they look so identical when the previous models of the Explorer and Expedition looked nothing alike I think some consumers are still weary about the Explorer after the whole Firestone mess so maybe this wasnt not_a not_smart not_design not_move By using loopholes in the emissions standards American and other auto manufacturers make more profit by selling vehicles such as SUVs and SUV like trucks classified as utility vehicles designed for utility not not_for not_commuting not_or not_everyday not_uses not_Problem not_is not_they not_re not_being not_advertised not_and not_sold not_as not_everyday not_use not_cars These loopholes have allowed American manufacturers to become dependant on the profit from selling more utility vehicles than cars A good example of this is Fords latest advertising campaign with Bill Ford talking ive only seen two versions of these commercials for trucks and for SUVs just their utility vehicles The roll over sensor allows the airbags to stay inflated it the vehicle is rolling and will deflate when it stops rolling I cant not_decide not_if not_this not_is

may not not_appeal not_to not_the not_class not_that not_will not_go not_off not_roading not_Overall not_the not_2003 not_Expedition is a nice vehicle in terms of some what luxury with refined off road handling But I did not not_find not_it not_fun not_to not_drive But I guess that technology is beyond Ford at this point and we ll have to leave it to the Japanese to introduce the first US hybrid SUV Ford can comply with car standards and have the new Expedition can achieve mileage of 17 22 or higher but Ford choose to keep the Expedition in the old utility class where the gas mileage requirements are lower they save money on manufacturing and the consumer pays more for gas Most consumers buying this model will not not_be not_using not_it not_for not_utility not_but not_more not_as not_a not_minivan not_commuter not_car So its important that a vehicle of this price range holds a high resale value Being a new redesigned model that can be a gamble especially with possible gas problems in the future I recommend taking a look at reviews of older Expeditions from owners and look at what used Expeditions are selling for You can check listings nationally at http www cars com Parting Shots Despite the changes and improvements the 2003 Expedition does not not_stand not_out not_from not_the not_competition but comes across as another run of the mill SUV The 2003 Expedition has a 3 year 36 000 mile bumper to bumper warranty 5 year 50 000 warranty on the safety restraint system and a 5 year 100 000 mile power train warranty I Resale Like a minivan I think most people buy a vehicle like this hoping they wont have to drive it for a long time maybe just until the kids grow up or until the boat phase is over Mainly because its expensive uses a lot of gas is a pain to wash and not not_the not_most not_exciting not_thing not_to not_drive There is nothing special about it and I can see where it can be classified with the tan minivan in terms of excitement Even though it has more luxury qualities it by no means has the reputation or demands the attention that one would get driving a luxury sedan such as a Lexus or an Acura that I think luxury buyers are looking for Nor is it as fun to drive because its more sluggish and the handling is mushy I dont not_think not_luxury not_buyers not_want not_to not_be not_mistaken not_for not_a not_dreaded not_soccer not_mom not_even not_if not_they not_are not_taking not_their not_kids not_to not_soccer not_practice When I say fun I mean something that handles with a little spirit is easy to drive and park and a little different unique in some aspects from other vehicles in its class Like the looks of the Toyota Matrix Pontiac Vibe or the above average power and gas efficiency of the Nissan Sentra Spec V or even the new hybrid technology and looks of the Toyota Prius But I did not not_find not_any not_of not_these not_qualities not_in not_the not_2003 not_Expedition not_I not_like not_something not_I not_can not_look not_forward not_to not_driving not_every not_morning but I think I would look forward to the Expedition about as much as I would to a bowl of bran cereal with skim milk The Expedition only has 20 7 cubic feet of storage behind the 3rd row of seats while the Sienna has 26 6 cubic feet the Odyssey has 38 1 cubic feet and the Sedona has 21 8 cubic feet again susprisingly more than the Expedition For head room the Expedition has 39 7 inches of headroom for the front row 39 8 inches for the 2nd row and 38 2 for the 3rd while the Honda Odyssey has more with 41 2 inches for the first row 40 0 for the 2nd and 38 9 for the 3rd In fact even the new small to mid sized Honda Pilot SUV has more head room than the Expedition at 41 9 inches for the 1st row 40 9 inches for the 2nd row and 38 9 inches for the 3rd If you re interested in the Expedition for space and cargo capacity looks like a minivan would be the better choice It just seems that the consumers and the environment are the losers in this greedy game of profit Pardon my instantaneous rage I just read a disturbing article on how Americas gas consumption and emissions pollution has nearly tripled since 1985 because of the SUV boom and what the government is not not_doing not_about not_it not_I not_like not_American not_vehicles not_as not_much not_as not_the not_next not_American but it seems that the Detroit three are shooting themselves in the foot by manufacturing all these trucks and SUVs we dont not_need not_with not_old not_standards not_when not_gas not_prices not_are not_going not_up not_the not_environment not_is not_becoming not_more not_of not_a not_concern not_and not_there not_is not_a not_big not_oil not_controversy not_on not_whether not_or not_not not_to not_drill not_in not_Alaska But I think most want the interior to feel like a home away from home whether its conservative or bold But its not not_quite as easy to customize your car interior as it is your home I think Ford tried to please everyone with the Expeditions interior but did it with as little statement as possible and no real boldness and seemingly sucking the sport out of sport utility vehicle I say this because its a little on the bland side according to Fords site and the one I drove there is only one color option for the interior so far Its tan or light beige with a tan and black plastic like dashboard Because the dash is so big there is a lot of negative space on it with no controls or vents making it seem like an ocean of plastic I would prefer more storage cubbies instead of wasted space The Expedition does sport a lot of black plastic on the exterior like many new SUV Trucks depending on what trim options you get im not not_really not_fond not_of not_that not_because not_its not_a not_maintenance not_pain not_requiring not_regular not_polishing not_so not_it not_does not_not not_turn not_white not_in not_the not_sun not_I not_used not_to not_gripe not_about not_polishing not_the not_front not_and

not_every not_6 not_months not_to not_keep not_up not_the not_plastic but that can cost around 200 for a vehicle that size each time Interior Its hard to say what people like in interiors everyone seems to want something different Some look for leather polished wood and a dial clock ive never figured that out while others may want a unique layout with cool upholstery design colored gauges and lots of light up goodies
Neg,The handling of the truck was much better than the old model To me it seems they were telling us just to DEAL WITH IT We tried to get Ford to buy the truck back but we got the run around This absolutely drove me crazy I took the truck to the shop 4 times for repair with no success They told us that it was a problem with the new design and they were going to develop a solution but as of right then they didnt not_have not_one The wider mirrors were great just watch what you re doing when pulling into the garage But on to other things my truck had a constant rattle coming from both the driver and passenger side doors After owning a 1999 Expedition XLT for 2 years and being very pleased with it in every aspect I expected the same from the 2003 Expedition Exterior looks great except for being a follower of the new Explorer but I have nothing against that I particularly loved the new interior design The third row seating is a vast improvement in the new Expedition I did not not_have not_the not_power not_fold not_option not_for not_the not_third not_row not_which not_is not_not not_a not_problem not_when not_letting not_the not_seat not_down but getting it back up is a little tricky I was pleased with the performance of the 5 4V8L and the independent rear suspension We have a really bad feeling about Ford and the new Expedition I really liked the truck and thought I would never go back to a car or smaller SUV but I did I now own a Jeep Grand Cherokee I didnt not_think not_I not_could not_love not_a not_vehicle not_as not_much not_as not_I not_love not_my not_Cherokee The dealer called in a Senior Engineer from Ford but he never determined exactly what the cause was So at that point I was extremely disappointed with the workmanship of the truck I hated getting into it each morning knowing I had to listen to the rattle for the 45 minute drive to work
Neg,It gave it a cheap look Drive train The 4wd unit I drove had the 5 4 V 8 Plenty of power If the rattle was any indication it probably wont last very long It leaned a lot and seemed bothered by large cross winds Plus this one had an annoying rattle in the roof Also it rode like a buck board My bum was very stiff Interior I liked the seats and I like how the dashboard was laid out But that is about all I liked So I am shopping for a Full size SUV I hate mini vans Besides I need 5 cars like a hole in the head First Impression God this thing is huge My daughter recently took over control of the Family 99 Explorer Plus I just dumped our van With this I decided that maybe my 3 seat explorer wasnt not_quite not_as not_big not_as not_I not_once not_thought It looks a lot bigger than a Tahoe but in reality its about the same size I liked the choice of exterior color although a rust color would look great I did not not_like not_the not_major not_use not_of not_plastic The gas gauge was at a quarter of a tank when I started the test drive and was dead on E when I returned I only drove 25 miles I did not not_like not_its not_handling not_very not_much not_either It was just plastic and some faux leather stuff Plus I thought the DVD system took up to much room I did not not_stay not_in not_more not_than not_thirty not_minuets and that is about all I could stand Durability
Neg,The trunk or hatch is pretty roomy and can be expanded by lowering the back seats Oh by the way mine is for sale if you re looking for one Ok let me start by saying I really enjoy driving this car Its low fairly spunky handles very well and looks great The next inspection required back brake calipers for around 300 My most recent problem is a bad headlight motor which sells for 400 Anyway these are just the major repairs My first problem was the alternator After 2 days in the shop and a 200 bill I had it back and working fine Next came the ignition system requiring the distributor to be replaced for over 600 It just hasnt done well at all for me Since purchasing this thing ive been in contact with several other 93 amp 94 Probe GT owners with a similar story Taking all this into consideration I obviously can not not_recommend not_this not_vehicle The front seats are comfortable although a bit difficult to climb in and out of The back seat is very small and not not_comfortable not_to not_ride not_in but I generally dont not_need not_room not_for not_more not_than not_2 not_so not_this not_isnt not_a not_problem not_for not_me Well now for the downside I bought this car in July of 1999 for just under book value I checked the title history and it had never been wrecked Since the time of purchase I have spent several thousand on repairs Add this onto a new set of tires a timing belt oil changes and other general maintenance insurance and well you do the math All of this happened in under 12 months of driving I have really enjoyed driving this car when it was working properly
Neg,But the seats themselves are quite comfortable I bought this vehicle used in 1997 That was 1400 and six days in the shop It corners on a manhole cover i e very wide It would cause the cars RPMs to ramp up in spurts And then the biggie a complete valve job and replacement of the O2 sensor The power window switch falling off the power attenae being power less The window fluid sprayer is basically not not_working not_There not_are not_a not_few not_noticeable not_rattles And then there are the minor things like the inner door panel on the driver side coming off So this car at least for me has been nothing but a headache as well as a financial drain The exhaust pipe broke at a seam in the middle that had to be soldered There is ample room in the trunk but equally un ample room in the rear seats for passengers It had only 42 000 miles on it a modest amount for Los Angeles and looked to be in great shape It was leaking tranny fluid from the pan All sorts of things that add up to a few hundred dollars It was leaking oil into the area of the spark plugs I found out that this is a COMMON problem of these 93 Probes But it drives very comfortably especially if you like a fairly stiff ride I bought the car because I liked how it drove and looked My understanding is that the 93 and 94 models have a lot of problems 93 was the first year of their redesign which may explain a lot of the problems The driver side seat doesnt really go back as far as I would like I would suspect for someone taller then me 5 10 it would be a problem If you like the look and you like it when you test drive then if my experience is indicitive then perhaps you need to look at a 95 or later Then I was driving home from work one day and a spark plug popped out of the engine block I know it sound implausible but it happened that required new wires So I took it in and they had a hard time even finding the problem and then fixing it several days in the shop and several hundred dollars later I got it back When it is operating it is fun car to drive I love the look of it and it certainly has some spunk with its V6 although I wish it accelerated a bit better The previous owner certainly kept up the aesthetic quality of the car So I test drove the car and after doing a little research decided to buy it Well the problems started soon after that The first major repair was when there was short in the electrical components of the cars overdrive
Neg,These were fixed within a few weeks They replaced it but it did not not_fix not_the not_problem It took them about 3 days to get the part So they cleaned some vacuum lines etc still could not not_find not_the not_problem When they replaced the EGR valve guess what it did not not_fix not_the not_problem not_Surprise not_surprise The dealership finally agreed to do the replacement I scheduled my appointment and took the car in They looked at the car again and found they thought that the Mass Airflow Sensor was bad 226 We took the car in and 2 days later these simple things were fixed In October of 1999 approx 18 months after purchase came the motherlode When we bought the car there was a couple of cosmetic things that needed fixed i e passenger side door panel falling off etc It only had 48 000 miles on it with a purchase price of 9 995 which I now know was about 9 900 too much Three different repair shops have looked over the car trying to determine if it is an electrical problem which I now understand these cars are notorious for having or a fuel problem The Probe overheated one morning when I got to work I shut the car off and fluids started draining from what seemed like everywhere under the hood Then when I got the car back the Check Engine light was on I called the dealership back and asked why the light was now coming on when it was not not_before I bought my 93 Ford Probe GT used in 1998 from a Jeep dealer STUPID I test drove the car and liked it because of the way it looked it was sporty and fun to drive About 6 months into our ownership some other not not_so not_cosmetic problems started happening brakes grinding loudly muffler not not_muffling not_normal not_wear not_and not_tear but things that should have been checked before the dealership sold the car The dealer I bought the car from came to my location and picked up the car After they looked at it they assessed that the water pump had gone out the oil pan gasket was leaking and it basically needed a valve job Thank GOD for extended warranty I was without my car for approximately 1 1 2 weeks Total cost for that job was around 1500 No one can seem to figure it out So now im back to the Ford dealer on Monday I wonder if they can pinpoint the problem I dont not_have not_a not_whole not_lot not_of not_faith I would not not_recommend not_this not_vehicle not_to not_anyone not_unless not_you not_have not_money not_to not_just not_throw not_away not_and not_a not_backup not_car not_to not_drive not_about not_every not_6 not_months not_for not_about not_a not_month not_at not_a not_time and if you are just looking for a headache Then they thought the O2 sensor was bad another 200 some replaced it to no avail Finally they told me after another week that they thought the EGR valve had gone bad but that it would not not_be not_covered not_under not_warranty not_310 not_for not_the not_part not_alone not_I not_explained not_to not_them not_that not_even not_though not_they not_considered not_this not_a not_wear not_and not_tear not_part not_I not_should not_not not_have not_to not_pay not_for not_it not_We not_went not_back not_and not_forth not_I not_took not_the not_car not_back not_and not_drove not_it not_engine not_light not_flashing not_in not_my not_face not_and not_all not_until not_I not_contacted not_the not_Better not_Business not_Bureau not_and not_a not_local not_television not_station After about a week in the shop they decided to send it to the Ford dealer down the street and let them look at it Two and a half weeks later I get my car back but only after they put the car on their computer it told them a part to replace they replaced it and it didnt not_fix not_the not_problem not_Ultimately not_I not_think not_it not_turned not_out not_to not_be not_a not_problem not_with not_a not_vacuum not_pump not_or not_something not_Now not_8 not_months not_later not_yet not_another not_seemingly not_impossible not_to not_figure not_out not_problem not_has not_surfaced not_On not_July not_1 not_2000 not_my not_car not_quit not_running not_unexplainably
Neg,It also handles well in the snow and rain They are fairly reasonable to fix too The car is beautiful sporty and ahead of its time Overall the Probe is a great looking car The body is very stylish today even though it was made in 93 its an eye catcher I bought this vehicle from a friend in 1999 he made me an offer I couldnt refuse The front seats are very comfortable and adjust to accommodate your liking However the back seats have virtually no legroom and are not not_designed not_for not_the not_comfort not_of not_backseat not_passengers The whole system was replaced Luckily it was still under warranty from the person who owned it before me He had paid 1 000 only a few months prior The problem with this is that the EQ only works with the stock CD player I had called Ford about replacing the old one with a new stock radio and the cost was 500 There have been no major problems with rust I love all of the options ex power sunroof power seats spoiler alarm ect The Probe GT has a lot of power with its V6 engine In the 8 months I have owned the car I have had replaced or fixed All 4 tires 350 Throttle sensor 200 all spark plugs 100 Tune up 200 Muffler system front to back 450 I also had the transmission worked on several times The mechanics couldnt find the problem until the third time I brought it in to them Finally they had taken it to the local Ford dealer and diagnosed it with a short in the transmission as well as being burnt up The ride is a little stiff and bumpy but generally speaking its enjoyable Unfortunately I have had a lot of repairs made in the short time I have owned it All mechanics I have been to say that it is a tough car to work on Not to mention every little piece of the 93 GT is expensive to replace In turn I replaced it with an after market stereo which disabled my equalizer but my new system is fantastic I have a few squeaks and rattles that I probably should have checked out but with the cost of everything on this car im afraid to find out Once I regain some money I will probably sell my 93 GT I have a few suggestions for anyone thinking of buying a 1993 Ford Probe GT Take into consideration the mileage if its high dont buy Find out how many people have owned the car Dont forget that its a sports car it may have been be abused Understand that you most likely will have problems with this car and be prepared to dish out a lot of money I would look into a different year and or model Another member of my family owns a first generation Probe 1989 and hasnt had too many problems even with 160 000K One problem I have now is that the Rpms are very jumpy I think this may have something to do with the computer as 93 GTs are known to have problems with this I have no washer reservoir for the front windshield because it had cracked I was told by Ford that the reservoir alone would cost 200 I had the entire sound system replaced the stock CD player broke only a few weeks after I bought the car and the speakers were already in need of replacement
Neg,Shes a beauty All one can do is hope Of course this happens to any make or model car I really think its best suited as a SECOND car I bought this car on December 31 1998 Since I have had nothing but problems So far mine have been minor just turn signals Just last week I got a flat In my area it seems to be the norm Ford Probes are known to have electrical problems If you re considering purchasing a Probe please keep an eye out for its SPECIALTY problems TRANSMISSION and ELECTRICAL Shes smooth as a babys butt and purrs like a kitten Upkeep of course will continue to remain a problem The inconvenience and the waiting associated with the Probe going in and out of the shop is frustrating Its a nice little car but keep the Excedrin handy When I purchased this car it had 71 000 miles I have heard the engines last till somewhere around 150 000 It is fine for folks who have the budget to keep up with it Money is not not_the not_only not_factor All the specialists I contacted claimed it was a VERY complicated job I did find someone to do it for 1 500 In May of 1999 my transmission let go This happened at 60 mph on the highway Transmission specialists rate the Probe as a Specialty car Therefore the repair price was inflated 3 000 Therefore I am NOT surprised by the problems I had hoped the FORD CO had paid some attention to mechanical parts I love the way she drives when in tiptop condition The price for tires is higher than average According to the tire dealer the tires are specific SPECIALTY I GUESS to the car I have very little faith in the cars dependability I am just waiting to see what will go wrong next I bought the PROBE because of her looks The drawback was the Probe ended up being in their shop for a month Next the intake manifold gasket let go Again I heard SPECIALTY car Again I heard complicated to fix I received a quote of 300 5 for the gasket 295 for the LABOR I did find a decent mechanic who did the job for 150 I dont not_know not_if not_mechanics not_in not_others not_areas not_use not_the not_word not_SPECIALTY not_as not_an not_excuse not_to not_jack not_up not_the not_price
Neg,They were wrong This venture cost us 1900 This ran us 300 each time We were both happy with our purchase It is under a 90 day guarantee We replaced it several times while in Germany We made it as far as Odessa Texas We did however have problems with the starter The above is why I hate the Explorer We searched around our area and came across the perfect medium In 1996 my husband and I decided to purchase a new car There is plenty of room for suitcases and tools all at the same time They just all seemed to forget until after we had all the problems To be exact we made it to mile marker 104 on I 10 It had what we both wanted We bought this 1992 Ford Explorer Eddie Bower Edition SUV We did once but my husband was able to fix that on his own We attributed that to the weather in Germany All of this puts us in the year 2000 It seems everyone knew about the problems with Ford A Cs another review all together starters and transmissions I can not not_place not_this not_vehicle not_on not_my not_love not_it not_or not_hate not_it not_list not_because not_both not_are not_true Not to mention the money of getting there to get the truck when it is fixed We shipped the truck to Germany and for three years we prayed that we would not not_have not_transmission not_problems We were assured by the Ford Dealer and the transmission shop that the transmission would hold up for the trip We return from Germany and embark on a road trip from Pennsylvania to Texas Our move involved towing a trailer That is where we were stranded because the transmission blew out Four days and 1900 later we have yet another transmission We are assured that we will no longer have problems with the transmission Sixty five days later my husband is on foot because the transmission has gone out AGAIN He wanted something he could tow things with and keep his tools in I wanted something with four doors so I would not not_have not_to not_fight not_with not_car not_seats We now have to tow the truck over 200 miles to get the transmission replaced under the warranty Another 342 we have to spend just getting the truck to the destination We made our purchase in October of 1996 By May of 1997 we had to replace the transmission I attributed this to my husband going four wheeling in a two wheel drive vehicle This is why I love it It is paid for I have the title for it It is roomy I love that it has the 60 40 seats The car seats all fit comfortably I have had three bulky car seats in the back at one time Being a short woman I love the adjustment switches that allow me to be close enough and hight enough to see over the steering wheel You can bet that I will look for something larger so I do not not_feel not_like not_a not_short not_person not_on not_the not_road not_I not_love not_my not_Explorer but I hate that I do not not_have not_deep not_enough not_pockets not_to not_keep not_it This is funny to my husband because he has to move the seat back before he can even get in the truck When I am in my Explorer I feel as big as the other people on the road I will be upset when we sell the Explorer for the reasons listed above
Neg,These are expensive repairs The truck is still expensive to keep up It has around 138 k on it at this point He has one and his transmission does the same thing It is also near the front control arm bushing and heats it so that it fails early The catalytic converter is in a place where it heats the transmission and causes it to fail early This truck is for someone who likes to make a good appearance and has deep pockets for maintenance However it looks like the biggest bug the tendency to roll over will not not_be not_worked not_out not_until not_the not_2002 not_model Your knees are closer to a ninety degree angle when you ride and that is a lot easier on your back than a sedan The truck is somewhat bouncy and if you are on a rough road you really feel it The good thing about the setup is the chair height This is how the other transmission started to fail According to the transmission guy I deal with this is a common problem with Explorers The engine is still tight However the AC Delco remanufactured transmission is now starting the same death dance as the old one Right now reverse is slow to engage when it is cold I bought this car new in September 1992 principally because my wife and daughter liked the Forest Green color SUVs were popular then and my wife liked the idea of being higher than the rest of the traffic The front suspension needed replacement as well At around 120 K the transmission failed in a catastrophic manner and it cost around 2 200 00 to replace with a remanufactured unit My dilemma is this The truck still looks great It is not not_for not_someone not_who not_appreciates not_fuel not_economy not_or not_low not_maintenance not_cost not_The not_1992 not_Explorer not_is not_an not_early not_version and there are a lot of bugs in it Some of the bugs were worked out in the 1995 makeover It is always needing something like brakes tie rod ends exhaust parts and such I have also detected weeping around the water pump I dont not_know not_whether not_to not_sell not_it not_now not_or not_keep not_it not_for not_the not_long not_haul While the body style may be unstable in sharp turns it sure holds a lot of haulage I have used it to truck each one of my kids to college I have found the truck to eat front brake pads I average around 15 k a set I also think that there are problems with the design of the truck
Neg,The acceleration is pretty darn good I oftentimes beat sporty little cars out of stoplights At that point I just had the thing towed to the dealership and told them that it was now their problem These are great vehicles but older SUVs like mine are best left for off roading and camping not not_your not_everyday not_commute They fixed the braked and the tranny again this time to the tune of 2400 my wallet cant not_take not_much not_more not_of not_this not_torture My best advice you want an SUV buy it new that way the warranty should take care of most any mechanical issue you can have The brakes havent worked properly since then and no dealership or mechanic has been able to fix the issue Just two weeks ago I was driving down a busy street parkway and the brakes went out on me again I inherited BOB T named by my brother stands for big old brown truck for my birthday 4 months ago I paid a symbolic 1500 and while I love it im ready to sell it Id always wanted an SUV after a few years of driving my teeny tiny Toyota Tercel so I was thrilled to get my brothers Explorer This time I couldnt pump the brakes to get this behemoth vehicle to stop I ended up losing control and hitting a guardrail I didnt not_do not_any not_serious not_damage not_to not_myself not_or not_the not_truck thank God But to add insult to injury as I was creeping back home from my little accident the tranny slipped severely and I almost ran into the back of an ice cream truck When I got it it had just over 101 k miles on it At first I was pleasantly surprised by how comfortable the seats were and with all the nifty little places to store stuff like under the front arm rest I was even more delighted to see that my gas mileage was much better than expected I get about 20 23 mpg in the city and about 25 on the highway Once the initial delight wore off thats when the problems started Now I understand that my BOB T is 11 years old but my brother took care of it well so I didnt not_expect not_to not_be not_shelling not_out not_this not_kind not_of not_money not_About not_3 not_weeks not_after not_I not_got not_the not_truck not_I not_had not_to not_replace not_the not_tranny not_nice not_lil not_dent not_in not_my not_wallet not_All not_seemed not_well not_for not_a not_week but it started slipping again I took it back to the dealership and they fixed that problem to the tune of 575 About 2 weeks later the brakes went out on me Back to the dealership and had the brakes replaced my wallet is taking a serious beating by now The last time I drove the truck was 4 days ago when I brought it home from the dealership im a little scared to drive it I kind of look at it as a deathtrap now So now its a very nice driveway decoration Although ive had some serious mechanical issues I love this Explorer because it can haul some major stuff I was able to haul all of my stuff home from college in one trip thats nothing to sneeze at considering I had everything but the kitchen sink in my dorm room I love the feeling of being up higher than everyone else and its a great vehicle to take on camping trips with a whole bunch of friends
Neg,The thing is my repair shop to whom I am very loyal explained they see the same repairs over and over on Explorers This truck as popular as it has been is not not_engineered not_to not_last not_I not_will not_not not_buy not_another not_one not_of not_these This is the 2 A C replacement and the 2nd transmission replacement I put a lot of highway miles on my cars and have had this truck in 4WD for less than 100 miles total I change the oil and have it serviced like a good boy and they fellow from whom I bought it was a nutcase for servicing I bought this because I needed 4WD and wanted something popular that I could easily resell I bought it used at 128 k and have put about 60 k on it In the 22 months of ownership I have spent over 6 500 in repairs and have replaced the A C the transmission the 4WD gears and lots of minor stuff
Neg,After that all was good for awhile till something else broke My Ford Explorer was the first vehical i have ever bought on my own The costs of keeping the engine and sorts working with this many miles on it was just too much This is a great truck for someone who wants to rebuild it and modify it but not not_for not_someone not_with not_a not_small not_budget not_me The thing after i bought it was great Loved it to death I owned the road in it and i loved working on it Then one day the transmission went out No big deal i thought this happens after 138 000 miles In my buddies Explorer same year we spun out on a dirt road goin 55 and was going sideways down the road I figured we would have flipped over but it stayed stuck to the road when we hit the clay embankment injuries were non existant and the total damage was around 1000 It took the beating with out a problem I was in a fender bender in mine and all i had was a scratch on my bumper when the lady had to get a whole new grill and stuff I think the problem was that my bumper hit her grill hood Too bad for the small car When ever one thing would break it would break something else I spent over 1200 fixing sensors that blew each other out Finally the last straw was when my engine blew Evidently a bearing went out and is causing the crankshaft to walk out of the engine ITs off the road now waiting to be rebuilt then sold to some other unlucky person Driving it was great Off road or on road i only got stuck once i was dumb and it hugged the road
Neg,First I would like to state that I did not not_choose not_to not_buy not_my not_92 not_Ford not_Explorer If you have ever rode a horse it is the same feeling as riding in this truck Anyone who wants to buy this vehicle would be a fool My parents bought this sports utility vehicle for me on my sixteenth birthday With out any knowledge of this vehicle they bought it blindly from an auction no less one thing that you should never do As I was looking up good and bad trucks to buy from consumer reports it states that this years ford explorer was a bad choice to buy because it has many problems I absolutely hate this vehicle for the fact that every time I would like to go somewhere something goes wrong with it Every 1000 miles I have to fill the oil up one quart and it is such a pain to deal with Then another thing that goes wrong with this car is that the windows or electrical problems have started to arise
Neg,Do your research first Or just leave it out side all the time and worry about vandalism The new VW Beetle gets better crash test ratings that most Ford SUVs and trucks They plan for this by charging a lot higher premium on SUVs than normal size cars One more popular misconception about large SUVs is that they are safer for families For the most part they are not not_Especially not_Fords You should get a quote from your insurance company first Now on average the Excursion puts out over 3 times or more with a V10 the carbon dioxide of a normal sized car This really angers people who care about the environment and causes them to do things to protest against this One of the popular things is SUV tagging If they d hit me would they have noticed Now driving behind the mammoth I can see the silhouette of the driver the only person in it through the back windows This is a new trend and who knows where it will go But do you want to constantly worry about your expensive SUV being vandalized and then pay for the repairs Thats just more costs to worry about Like keeping your vehicle in your garage Not the Excursion and most large SUVs they wont fit unless you have a custom garage I bet thats expensive also Which means it gets 12 5 miles per gallon or less the V10 averages 7 miles per gallon My Toyota gets 7 times that mileage Meaning that an Excursion driver is paying on average 4 to 7 times more for gas that a car driver Of course unless you have 40 000 to spend on one you are going to have a high car payment Which is obvious most consumers expect this But did you budget the high fuel cost as well A Ford Excursion weights about 7 600 pounds Because of this it has a V8 or a V10 engine Where they ll put bumper stickers on your SUV say mean things like your changing the climate and you dont not_care not_about not_the not_air not_Please not_check not_out not_the not_sites not_I not_have not_listed not_below not_for not_more not_information not_on not_this not_http not_abcnews not_go not_com not_sections not_us not_DailyNews not_madtaggers not_001225 not_html not_http not_www not_baaction not_org not_SUVticket not_index not_html not_http not_www not_idontcareaboutair not_com not_bumpers not_index not_shtml not_http not_www not_charm not_net not_marc not_chronicle not_suv not_may01 not_html not_http not_poseur not_4x4 not_org not_topten not_html This will add somewhere between 175 to 350 a month to your car payment Still think you can afford this Then lets talk insurance Because the Excursion is big and heavy if the driver gets into an accident like what almost happened to me above it will cause a lot of property damage and injuries that your insurance company will have to pay for On top of that there is a big risk that the drivers or drivers family of the smaller cars will sue you Which means you and or your insurance company could be out a lot of money Ah the driver is on a cell phone I honked and flashed my lights but I dont not_think not_they not_noticed not_Okay not_this not_review not_is not_not not_just not_trashing not_the not_Excursion not_im not_mainly not_writing not_it not_to not_bring not_up not_a not_few not_important not_points not_about not_large not_SUVs not_to not_consider not_before not_purchasing not_As not_you not_know not_large not_SUVs not_have not_been not_stirring not_up not_a not_lot not_of not_controversy not_lately not_that not_buyers not_should not_know not_about not_before not_purchasing not_I not_recently not_purchased not_a not_new not_car not_but not_considered not_an not_SUV not_first not_and not_did not_a not_lot not_of not_research not_into not_them not_and not_promptly not_changed not_my not_mind not_First not_of not_all not_there not_are not_lots not_off not_hidden not_costs not_on not_large not_SUVs not_like not_the not_Excursion Its 8 30 AM and I am on my way to work in my economy Toyota Cruising in the fast lane I notice a Ford Excursion poking along in the slow lane ahead of me As I get closer to passing it I notice the wall of SUV next to me getting closer to me I slam on my breaks and the Excursions back end barley misses taking off the front end of my Toyota as it moves into the fast lane in front of me Did the driver even see me Were they even looking Maybe those big mirrors on the side werent aimed low enough to pick up my car

Neg,It is out and will stay out except for the toe angle These were Ford motor company factory replacement springs and hopefully an aftermarket spring will be stronger In as little as 60 000 miles I have seen Contours needing both lower ball joints and outer tie rod ends replaced due to loosness There are some very well engineered and built suspensions out there but all the same some very weak and suspect ones in my opinion and my purpose is to help you make a more informed decision The Contour is only toe adjustable not not_allowing not_for not_any not_caster not_adjustment not_nor not_front not_or not_rear not_camber not_adjustment not_so not_if not_you not_give not_it not_a not_little not_curb not_shot not_and not_it not_gets not_knocked not_out not_of not_align not_there not_just not_is not_no not_taking not_it not_to not_your not_tech not_and not_tweaking not_it not_back not_into not_align To start off with one of the things about the Contour that I dont not_like is that the ball joints and outer tie rods both are susceptible to premature wear out Neither are factory greasable but to be fair hardly any cars anymore allow for chassis lube I have read many reviews on automobiles from aesthetic interior power warranty options etc points of view I believe an important but always neglected area though is from an undercar point of view and let me tell you most people are missing a very important part of researching a prospective major purchase by not not_being not_well not_enough not_informed not_about not_the not_running not_gear In times past I could look at my schedule at work and accurately predict by what vehicles were on it where I would be able to take a break because I would be sure I would just be writing an estimate and not not_doing not_an not_alignment not_on not_that not_one not_Unfortunately not_the not_Contour not_is not_starting not_to not_come not_into not_this not_category They seem very small in diameter compared to other cars in this class and are in fact weak Usually in replacing coil springs on most vehicles you need a spring compressor to remove and replace springs due to the extreme pressure but I changed rear springs on a Contour not not_too not_long ago and was able to push the spring down and start the nut on the strut shaft with just hand pressure It is not not_an not_extremely not_expensive not_repair but one would hope not not_to not_have not_to not_get not_that not_news not_at not_such not_a not_low not_mileage not_point not_I not_am not_sure not_if not_you not_are not_the not_original not_owner not_things not_should not_be not_covered not_under not_warranty not_but not_how not_many not_times not_has not_the not_dealer not_been not_very not_co not_operative not_with not_you not_and not_taken not_care not_of not_a not_warranty not_claim not_without not_any not_trouble not_But not_if not_you not_are not_the not_second not_owner not_Another not_bothersome not_problem not_cropping not_up not_with not_the not_Contour not_lately not_is not_the not_rear not_coil not_springs not_break If you are considering a new Contour read more reviews and weigh them out against this one to see if you can justify the purchase if you are considering a used one have it checked carefully by YOUR mechanic for the things mentioned above Hopefully this will help you in making an informed decision I for one would never own a Contour but I am basing this on just my experience from underneath you make the call If a decision is being made between one of a few different vehicles I hope to help you decide based on my experience which one will be better for you from the standpoint of strength of and reliability of one of the most important parts of the vehicle as a whole the steering and suspension system The Ford Contour unfortunately from an undercar standpoint falls into the category of a weak and suspect suspension I just read a great review by mkaresh on the Ford Contour from almost every other viewpoint but the undercar but he is an intellectual professional and I am a mechanical professional and im quite sure he doesnt spend a lot of time on a dirty shop floor
Neg,Very poor design This car needs to go on a serious diet The high beams were average but the low beams were nonexistant There is no excitement to be found here The Interior is some what comfortable but the look is very drab The first was a Ford minivan which I simply would not not_drive not_under not_any not_circumstance So I had to drive a rental car for close to a month and I had two choices If you drive at 35 mph at night with the low beams on you are overdriving them When the ABS didnt not_kick not_in not_the not_car still took forever to stop due to its heavy weight The throttle response was horribly slow as well If you needed to get some speed to make a pass you better plan ahead about three seconds But with that said I can honestly say I have not not_liked not_the not_look not_of not_one not_single not_Ford not_car not_since not_the not_early not_90s and the Contour is no exception It drove like a SUV Not only did it have a horribly stiff suspension when you hit bumps in the road but the car leaned like a SUV when you went around corners Now the gas economy of this car was just as bad as everything else With my 80 mile commute every day I usually had to stop every other day and get twenty dollars in gas This car doesnt make a good commute car it doesnt make a good FUN car its not not_built not_well not_enough not_to not_be not_a not_family not_car not_I not_cant not_honestly not_think not_of not_anything not_good not_about not_this not_car When I picked the car up from the rental company it had a quarter of a tank before I even got home I had a gass light flashing at me Another improvement that needs to be addressed are the headlights You would feel like you were about to roll the car taking a corner any faster then 25 Its acceleration was less then stellar as well Even with a V6 in the car you felt like it would take forever to get up to speed Not only did the car take forever to get to speed it took just as long to stop Perhaps part of this problem is due to the incredibly cheap Firestones the car comes with I ended up having the ABS kick in no less then three times doing pretty standard stops It would be a nice treat if ford stopped designing plain cars that are cheap to mass produce and design something that is better built better to drive more practical and not not_so not_plain Agree or disagree with me if you like but this car goes into my books as a total blunder The second choice was a Ford Contour and I have to tell you it was the worst car i ever sat behind the wheel in First off the Ford contour has all the visual appeal of Grandmas car in my humble opinion I suppose not not_a not_whole not_lot not_more can be expected from Ford Yes if you havent noticed I am a touch biased An awkward factory stereo consumes most of the center console and the rest is used up by oversized dials for the heater and air conditioning One of my biggest problems with this car was the fact you couldnt turn the air conditioning on with the defroster on Now for those who dont not_live not_in not_cold not_weather the air conditioner will take the moisture out of the air and defog your windows To top all the poor layout of the interior everything was just cheap cheap plastic Nothing fit snuggly so the whole cab of the car had rattles Even at less then a year old and almost no miles this car was in poor condition I hated driving it Now that I have pointed out some of the flaws of the interior of the car I will tell you how it drove
Neg,The wiper blades malfunctioned and gouged her winshield Other than that its a good little car My mother owns a 94 Ford Contour Special Edition four door sedan There have been Six SIX Manufacturers recalls on various parts of the vehicle She takes impeccable care of it yet things are constantly falling apart She was only notified of this AFTER the recalled item had effectively ruined another part of the automobile ex It has fast pick up excellent braking and the gas mileage is nothing short of miraculous for its size im almost sorry to put it down but consumers deserve the truth The shop fixes one thing and another goes wrong Sure all cars have their weak points but it is ridiculous Definately not not_a not_car for someone who doesnt know how to do home repairs
Neg,As for the interior it is basic and functional What am I buying instead A 2000 BMW 323 Ci As for the reason I sold the SVT for a BMW One thing the SVT is known for is its sweet exhaust note I recently sold my 1 1 2 year old 1998 5 Ford Contour SVT If you are behind an SVT you WILL hear it accelerate At idle it is a low rumble almost resembling a V 8 During acceleration the exhaust really comes to life Mid range torque is adequate but high end torque is outright amazing All of the fun and acceleration in this car is over 4 000 RPMs all the way to about 6 500 RPMs The dash layout is not not_cluttered not_or not_overdone i e Pontiac Unfortunately it is very basic and almost seems to be missing something This is a result of Fords decontenting on the interior since the inception of the Contour in 1995 It has a better ride is quicker equal handling and I no longer have to deal with Ford dealerships Overall I would only recommend the SVT if you can live with pesky problems and have a well established relationship with the service manager of your local Ford dealership Two reasons overall quality and refinement My SVT was in for small pesky repairs on 3 occasions in the 18 months I owned it It started with a squeaky clutch pedal which is certainly annoying in rush hour traffic Next the paint on the sill panel below the drivers side door was beginning to peel It is not not_hard not_to not_chirp not_the not_tires not_shifting not_into not_second not_gear not_Handling not_is not_also not_superb not_nothing not_like not_a not_Contour not_SE not_Turn not_ins not_are not_sharp not_with not_almost not_no not_understeer not_I not_always not_enjoyed not_highway not_entrance not_ramps not_in not_the not_SVT not_by not_the not_time not_I not_reach not_the not_merge not_lane not_I not_could not_easily not_be not_going not_80 not_MPH This commentary will explain my recent and difficult decision First let me praise Fords Special Vehicle Team for creating an extremely fun to drive and practical sports sedan Performance in the SVT is impressive based on a relatively small V 6 The engine is one of the top 5 most efficient engines in the world measured by HP divided by Liter Low end torque is not not_exceptional not_similar not_to not_other not_competing not_cars not_in not_the not_same not_class This is unacceptable based on paint technology in todays cars Embarassing too Lastly the airbag indicator light began to blink intermittently Upon further examination the entire computer system was faulty and needed to be replaced I sold the car with 28 000 miles on it before the warranty expired and these pesky repairs started coming out of my pocket As for the BMW it may be more expensive than the SVT Contour approx 6 000 with similar options but it is a reliable refined sport sedan
Neg,My parents currently own a 98 Ford Contour the Sport version It has comfort seating for people that are three feet tall My dad does that now cause it wont start piece of FORD The exhaust manifold and does it stink for at least three weeks after changing the oil YES Would I take this car if someone paid me to NO I think I would pay someone to take it away When sitting in the back seat you find out how flexible you are and how far you can put your legs behind your head Good ol Ford engineering put the oil filter right above the exhaust manifold so where does all that oil drain onto My dad says that this car is his biggest mistake he had ever made I always warned him about those Ford vehicles where Quality is our 1 Job hah This car has been recalled four times now that is Built Ford Tough
Neg,This is not not_a not_car not_for not_the not_NBA It I was actually pretty pleased with the car This might be a good thing if you are trying to cure yourself of speeding but it drove me nuts There are some people this is going to be a great car for I am not not_one not_of not_them Then there was the issue of the trunk I like having space but not not_at not_the not_expense not_of not_rear not_seat not_safety It fit the three of us well there was an incredible amount of trunk space and I got really wonderful mileage about 36 mpg And then as I revised and revised certain things began to stand out in my mind I am not not_a not_tall not_woman not_I not_am not_not not_even not_five not_and not_a not_half not_feet not_tall The choices I had about driving my van until the parts came in no way borrowing a car from a family member haha or doing without led me to call the local U Rent The ergonomics of the air and radio controls were aligned in such a way that I had to wait and read the buttons to see what was where I dont not_like not_reading not_as not_I not_drive And yet somehow I managed 50 of the time to bang my knee getting into the car I didnt not_need not_to not_readjust not_the not_seat or anything it was back as far as it could roll The arm rest between the passenger and drivers seat was interesting If it was down you could not not_use not_the not_drink not_cups not_or not_the not_storage and it was so high that I felt like I was resting my arm on a plane level with my heart Have you ever written an opinion only to have it be eaten by the server at the last second I have tried to write this several times now and with each revision I get a little less amused I would up renting the Contour because my minivan was getting new brakes The Contour has one of the folding back seats that instantly increases the trunk space I am always afraid of being rear ended and getting a passenger impaled as a result I dont not_trust not_the not_seat not_latches not_Most not_of not_my not_driving not_was not_normal not_stuff not_which not_is not_good not_because not_the not_Contour not_does not_not not_have not_enough not_pluck not_to not_get not_you not_onto not_the not_Interstate not_and not_merging not_Nor not_can not_it not_accelerate not_up not_hill
Neg,We returned 3 times for the same recall We had NUMEROUS problems with our new car I have purchased 2 Ford Contours in the past 2 years In neither of our accidents did our air bags go off In August of 98 our Contour was in a accident It had flipped hitting numerous trees before coming to a stop Yet we still had faith in our car Until just last week But yet they were both considered TOTALED I ask how can a semi family car have been so easily turned over not not_once but twice Our car was in another accident trying to avoid a deer our car swerved as we tried to regain control of the car it also flipped Yes i was very surprised to hear that a Contour could be flipped by being ran off the road But that still didnt not_bother not_us not_we not_decided not_to not_buy not_another not_Contour not_in not_Sept not_98 not_From not_September not_to not_December not_of not_99 not_we not_received not_7 not_recalls My reasoning for buying a Contour was the price I felt I was getting a pretty nice roomy some what sporty car for the money I needed a family car but did nt want a van or SUV With my first Contour I had very few problems besides the few recalls
Neg,The shifts are very lethargic in nature The engine and transmission performance is questionable but not not_terrible The trannies rarely last more than 100k miles The speaker performance seems a little weak but not not_horrible The tranny shifts very slowly from gear to gear It felt very solid but was obviously not not_well built The transmission although silky smooth is a slow shifting dog of a tranny The stereo is a decent standard system Nothing too bad or too great just adequate The controls on the stereo are standard issue tick tack size Ford stereo buttons that can be a little tricky to use while driving The interior is modern attractive and functional overall I like the dashboard used on the Mercury Mystique better though My only major concern with this car is the overall reliability These cars are also plaugued with electrical bugs Good luck to anyone who owns one Overall its a very well designed car that was poorly executed I was lucky enough to get to drive my best friends 2000 Ford Contour SE for a week and then drive it from New York state to Georgia I was pleasantly suprised with the overall performance of the car The entire top of the dashboard is peeling up near the base of the windshield and it looks awful for a 40 k mile car Also the small pod that houses the power window switches on the drivers door feels very cheap and flimsy It idles buzzy and is buzzy when revved up which it likes to do a lot Overall I think the engine is a good balance of performance and fuel economy at around 32mpg on the highway The engine is snappy from a start and is powerful enough on the highway However due to its small displacement of 2 0L it is weak on hills at any speed I also think the engine is a bit on the buzzy side As far as the appearance of the car inside and out I think its an attractive car although I prefer the front end styling of the previous design Contour I love the rear end styling Its attractive simple stylish and looks like it belongs on a much more expensive car When you press one of the buttons the whole pod wiggles and creaks as if it is going to fall into the door if you press too hard I was not not_impressed not_with not_this not_However the car feels and sounds very solid overall and I was impressed This can become a bit annoying in stop and go traffic when the transmsission up shifts even though you are already applying the brakes I realized that pushing the overdrive on off button to keep the car from shifting into overdrive helps the excessive shifting alot The front seating is very supportive with great bolstering to keep your tushy from sliding around during cornering I was really expecting my butt to be sore by the end of the 17 hour drive but it wasnt not_I not_also not_find not_the not_driving not_position not_to not_be not_very not_comfortable not_as not_well
Neg,The maneuverability was fine if not not_well heeled The trunk was nice and big and the windshield wipers fine And the fine wheels of the Contour were putting all those bumps directly to my arms It had little gusto on the freeways although I didnt not_get not_a not_chance not_to not_try not_it not_on not_any not_hills not_because not_there not_apparently not_arent not_any not_in not_Detroit This thing felt like it was made of plastic except for the seats which were way too soft I am probably a little skewed because of the bad roads but this car had little going for it It had all the standard boring features of a mid size American car The sightlines were fine I think that this car stood out most for what it didnt not_do not_stand not_out not_It not_was not_just not_another not_boring not_bad not_lifeless not_American not_car And I know a lot about those having grown up driving a Buick Regal and now the proud owner of a Mercury Sable Pony up a little more and try something besides the safe and boring American car I drove this pathetic little car for a weekend as a rental in Detroit As I pointed out in the review of Detroit my arms were sore at the end of the weekend I was in town for a wedding and got the cheapo Hertz special at Detroit Airport I got myself an ugly gold Contour that I had to run out through the rain to get from the Hertz lot Now Detroit is a car city right Well these are some of the worst most beat up roads I have ever come across
Neg,It was an OK price Its really too bad about my Contour Also power window controls suck they are flush with the door and are very hard to operate With the 205 tires that came standard on the SE you can do anything and it will track great Worst cup holders in the world though I gave up drinking coffee in it after spilling about 3 fulls cups The car is alot of fun to drive I have the SE version with the 170 hp V6 But I have the reoccuring NO START problem I go out to start it and about once a month it wont start Turns over fine but wont catch I have had it into Ford 7 times now and they cant not_seem not_to not_fix not_it not_I not_am not_currently not_intereing not_into not_Arbitration not_with not_Ford not_on not_it not_Its not_too not_bad not_because not_when not_it not_runs not_it not_is not_a not_blast not_to not_drive not_Fast not_as not_hell not_and not_corners not_like not_it not_is not_on not_rails
Neg,I have some bad news and I have some good news The sound system for the radio isnt not_as not_clear not_as not_mine The interior has blah grey cloth seats Again its only a rental so naturally This model Contour is equipped with driver and passenger front airbags and has a decent looking instrument panel and dash The first thing I noticed was how loud the engine is My usual vehicle purrs in comparison Other than those items I mentioned ive already decided I would never buy one of these Contours While I mentioned the air conditioner to be nice and cold it has some drawbacks too Its rather noisy and no matter how you set the control its never just right The depth looked the same so it amounted to the fact that you can probably fit two large pieces of luggage and no more if you consider the door hinges As the Contour is bigger than my vehicle I was disappointed to see that its trunk was only slightly bigger if bigger at all than my cars trunk While giving a nice outward appearance there is nothing particularly rich looking or feeling inside nor does this auto have any outstanding features to write home about and what surprised me the most not not_even a cup holder While there were no dents to the exterior it was very noticeable that every scratch on it whether it be big or small had turned white White against the dazzling emerald green is very noticeable so I guess Id have to make a negative comment about the exterior paint finish if this is the caliber one is to expect from a Ford Contour A good finish does not not_allow not_every not_hairline not_scratch not_to not_stick not_out not_like not_a not_sore not_thumb There are three things I like about this 1999 4 door Ford Contour that ive been driving for the past few days one being the comfort of the drivers seat two being a nice cold air conditioner and three being a fairly roomy back seat My Geo Prism lacks in those departments Id customize it if I were buying so I cant not_knock not_the not_choice not_of not_interior not_or not_color not_or not_features not_I not_did not_notice not_something not_as not_soon not_as not_I not_rented not_it not_though not_and not_I not_mentioned not_it not_to not_the not_rental not_car not_representative not_First not_of not_all not_the not_side not_moldings not_of not_the not_car not_which not_appear not_to not_be not_made not_of not_rubber not_were not_the not_same not_exact not_color not_as not_the not_exterior On low it doesnt operate effectively and on the next notch it blows you away noise and all Its almost annoying to think about listening to the radio when its on The humidity was horrific in my city today Usually I just open the window but today I had to use the air conditioner and ive got to tell you if an ambulance or fire truck was in the area I never would ve heard its sirens They say theres a reason for everything and a little good will come from something bad I guess this is true because while I was very disappointed to have the setback and costly repair and expense associated with my cars problem im glad I got to drive a newer car to see just what I was missing While the Contour gives a nice appearance and a fairly smooth ride overall its bad features outweigh its good ones The rental I have which is the higher end model of the Contour i LX does not not_have not_power not_windows not_and not_locks not_cruise not_control not_or not_ABS not_brakes not_etc not_so not_I not_cant not_comment not_on not_those but for what it does have im surprised to say that my Geo Prism gives a more enjoyable ride at least a less noisy one However Id still opt to take a Contour over my car when going on a very long drive because the seat gives much more support to my back than mine does The bad news is that my car is in the repair shop with a leaking gas line More bad news is I not not_only have to incur the expense of the repair but I have to incur the expense of renting a car as its a holiday weekend and my car wont be done for several days and I cant not_drive not_it not_like not_it not_is not_for not_fear not_that not_I not_ll not_blow not_up not_Now not_for not_the not_good not_news not_I not_guess not_Just not_when not_I not_was not_cursing not_my not_car not_and not_thinking not_about not_buying not_another not_the not_Ford not_Contour not_has not_made not_me not_appreciate not_my not_own not_vehicle not_at not_least not_I not_know not_I not_will not_appreciate not_it not_once not_the not_repair not_is not_done
Neg,It does excellent on the highway The side strip molding is falling off It does not not_want not_to not_stay not_on not_very not_well There is a constant rattling in the passenger side of the dash board We were trying to trade in our old piece of junk The reason that I bought my Ford Contour is because we badly needed a dependable car It has a high idle when coasting in the city and rural roads usually under 45 mph The salesperson was very helpful and knowledgeable in his field Since November we have had several problems with this car The interior and exterior colors are very pleasant to look at I would not not_recommend not_this not_particular not_Ford not_automobile not_to not_the not_average not_person This is for the average family of more than three people I would not not_buy not_this not_car not_again not_because not_of not_the not_problems not_that not_we not_have not_encountered We have not not_had not_to not_take not_this not_car not_in not_yet but we are in the process of taking for its first visit to the dealership At least that is what we thought we were getting On a whim we went to our nearest Ford dealer and started pricing new cars We have taken several trips from Indiana to North Carolina and have had no problems to speak of This vehicle has a lot of room in the front but very little in the back But as we found out we enjoyed our old piece of junk better than our new car We purchased this vehicle in November of 1999 We paid approximately 18 000 This car comes equipped with cruise control tilt steering wheel ac am fm cassette stereo and a very spacious trunk Also has low profile tires which the only problem with that is that they are very expensive to replace
Neg,The seats were small and uncomfortable This is not not_a not_drivers not_car At least not not_with not_this not_engine The doors are somewhat small making entry and exit more challenging The most negative of my rental experiences I have saved for last The 1999 Ford Contour The drivers seat reminded me of the long flight that I had just been through It was a long trip and being unable to get settled simply made it worse This car is fine for basic transportation or short trips but I found it small underpowered and uncomfortable It does have the normal package of power windows and locks and they are easy to understand and use The doors are also thinner and feel flimsy compared to other cars that I have been driving Inside It allowed for an entire 10 days of disappointing driving Outside Visually unremarkable the Contour has the plain lines of a scaled down Taurus If this car had the options like a larger engine than the 4Cyl a better sound system better seats something then this might only be a mediocre rating But there were none It often overpowered the radio which was also whiny when played loud I could quickly see that this car was not not_going not_to not_make not_the not_1 not_5 not_hour not_journey not_pleasant The panel display is flanked by a plastic divider that emphasizes how small the car is It really worsens the cramped feeling in the passenger cabin Engine noise is loud with the 4cyl engine whining at almost every acceleration The other controls are as easy to understand but everything in the car has a cheap feel to it I was consistently nervous that I was going to break something But generally I was thinking of the engine Driving The base model has nothing to make it look appealing it still has Fords unfortunate taste for ovals dominating its appearance Fit and finish is fine it had a smallish trunk that seemed full with two medium bags and a laptop case As I dodged the 18 wheel heavies on the highway out of Cincinatti I wasnt not_at not_all not_confident not_about not_the not_acceleration not_or not_the not_handling not_of not_the not_little not_Ford not_Trying not_to not_pass not_a not_heavy not_dump not_truck not_on not_a not_two not_lane not_onramp not_I not_had not_the not_pedal not_to not_floor not_wishing not_for not_just not_some not_of not_the not_horsepower not_I not_had not_left not_garaged not_in not_Massachusetts It was pretty much that way for the rest of the trip Slow pickup and that only to the tune of the engine whining loudly Iffy handling in turns I felt the car was at maximum performance at 75 All around I wont drive this car again I began specifically requesting full size cars after this unless I could get a Grand Am or a Mustang at close to the same rate
Neg,The front passenger seat is identical to the drivers seat In the exterior rubber window liners are falling apart as well And of course there was the warping dash which required a Ford recall The 3 way catalytic converter failed completely clogging the exhaust path and stalling the engine It looks so cheap and old it should belong in a Tempo or Pinto instead If money were no object I would immediately have my Contour towed into a junkyard The engine uses distributorless ignition system and the ignition coil failed for no reason at 60 000 miles In reality selling the car isnt not_much not_better not_because not_the not_depreciation not_on not_Contours not_has not_been not_extremely not_steep That meant that my preference was for European vehicles instead of the reliable but conservative Japanese sedans such as Honda Accord The seat doesnt have the height adjustment of newer cars but it does have the standard fore aft and seatback adjustments In the interior rattles are starting to take over and one of the radio speakers is starting to die In fact some people were even bragging about putting 150 000 miles on their Contours having to replace only the water pump The engine would be the only thing worth salvaging and the rest of the car would be no more than scrap metal What does this mean I get cut rate service when I bring in my Contour while SUV owners get first class service The only thing that didnt not_change and therefore retained its European character was the instrument cluster which is very legible and well lit In fact repairs have already cost more than the value of the car itself Dealer service Ford has focused too much on its trucks At least the body damage was not not_my not_fault and was being paid by the other partys insurance but I had to do some explaining to avoid rental charges Owner clubs The interior of my 1999 model is a sore loser Compared to the interior in the Jetta the Accord or even lowly cars like the Corolla my Contour is absolutely cheap It was an issue Ford fixed under a recall I had never heard of until I had my car towed into a dealership Driving and Seating Position In addition to the dealership that put water into my fuel tank I also had to deal with dealerships on several other occasions often over body work The compensation for the cramped rear seat is a large trunk unfortunately fold down rear seat was an option I skipped and that limits the usefulness of the trunk Performance My only gripe about the exterior is that the rear is just a blob of red lights and reflectors I personally prefer the more conventional styling of the Mondeo complete with amber turn signals In the early Contours the interior lights turned on with a switch next to the light itself in mine I must use the dashboard dimmer switch a cheap American trick I hate The rear seat is indeed very cramped Contours are saddled with ridiculously low headlines and that means the rear seat is farther forward than where it should be taking away legroom This wasnt not_the not_case not_when not_Contours not_first not_came not_out not_for not_the not_1995 not_model not_year not_those not_earlier not_Contours not_felt

vehicle not not_a not_utilitarian not_family not_sedan The average Ford dealer keeps only a dozen or so cars in stock as opposed to hundreds of pickup trucks and SUVs Even worse Fords SUVs are popular because they are yuppie friendly not not_because not_they not_are not_capable not_or not_well not_built This midsize car is even more cramped than compacts such as the Corolla the Civic or even Fords own Focus made even worse because of the cheap materials Vinyl door liners belong to taxicabs and police cruisers and are grossly inappropriate in my car There was no way for me to consider a four door American sedan but I made an exception for the Contour Mystique knowing that they had European personalities and that the other triplet the Mondeo was the best selling vehicle in its class in

windshield wipers kept their European look in my car they feel very cheap when operating I can even feel the click of the turn signal Adding insult to injury the dash was so cheap it warped The dimmer switch even heats up when I dim the instrument cluster for rural driving thats REALLY cheap Even worse various switches and markings that once had been painted white were now simply embossed in my car making them harder to see And the newer center console in my car After a crazy round of parts swapping and shopping for nonexistent ignition coils at odd hours Ford dealers rarely stock these a dealership finally fixed it but only after putting in water into the fuel tank and blaming that water for the problems and charging 1 000 to drain the fuel tank That was not not_the not_case not_to

not_American not_models With the dealerships being so useless I hoped the owner clubs particularly the online one at contour org would be of some help Sure I did get hints about having to upgrade differentials on SVT Contours which in turn meant a weak powertrain that couldnt handle the engines power I was in the market for my first car in 1999 and I wanted to be very sure to buy a new car with decent credentials I shopped around and did my research in the smaller midsize segment Fords world car triplets Ford Contour and Mercury Mystique for North America and Ford Mondeo for the rest of the world caught my attention This is the primary reason why Ford never had success in selling Contours and Mystiques in North America and it also explains why Ford increasingly cheapened these models selling them as heavyweight V6 compacts instead of midsize cars they otherwise should have been Eventually Ford billed the lightweight compact Focus as the Contour replacement in North America while it sells both the Focus and a redesigned larger Mondeo in Europe In the end it came down to a choice between the Ford Contour and a true European sedan the Volkswagen Jetta Fords longer warranty and cheaper price won out To fully exploit the European character I chose a Contour that was equipped with V6 engine manual transmission 4 wheel disc brakes and a sport package I felt quite confident knowing that the only issues known were a few recalls and the rather smallish back seat It still runs very smoothly and there are virtually no signs of the 67 000 miles ive put on it There is some oil consumption but that is within acceptable limits Splurging on Mobil 1 synthetic oil seems to have helped but with the rest of the car being pure junk I dont not_know if the cost is justifiable anymore Ignition system was another matter though The left rear door also has an occasional rain leak I cannot not_trace not_Over not_the not_years not_Contours not_have not_racked not_up not_six not_recalls not_way not_too not_many not_Even not_the not_best not_designed not_vehicles not_occasionally not_have not_a not_recall not_or not_two but when there are six recalls I must wonder what the heck the Ford engineers were doing with their 6 billion The Focus Fords newer and smaller world car is even worse with already eight recalls and another four defects under Us government investigation There was quite a hype about these vehicles as Ford had spent 6 billion to create the infrastructure necessary to design a car that could be sold in just about any country a concept familiar to the Japanese but very foreign to American companies I do remember that these vehicles were named the European Car of the Year in 1994 and the North American Car of the Year in 1995 Just about everyone was raving about how these cars drove like the BMW 325 at only half the price It was as if I put in leaded gasoline into my car something that could never happen these days I always used the best brands of gasoline possible usually Chevron leaving even fewer excuses for exhaust failure Perhaps the only excuse left is the water that had been put into the fuel tank by the previously mentioned dealership to blame the ignition failure on Currently I only have one section of the catalytic coverter repaired at least the exhaust is open again but fuel economy has dropped by about 2 miles per gallon and I will need a complete repair before my next smog test One dealership improperly mounted the engine after the body work causing my car to rattle in the engine compartment I repeatedly went back to the dealership but the body shop workers claimed to never hear it hoping I would give up Only after six months of complaint did the dealership give in Another dealership chose to book me for body work and recall work on the same appointment even though the body work was sublet out to an independent body shop next door which was booked solid for the next two weeks I ended up having to rent a car twice because the works were done separately and insurance adjusters werent happy The transmission the other part of the 6 billion investment is already history Manual transmissions are supposed to be virtually

that lean heavily into corners such as the Corolla this made me really appreciate the performance Quality and Reliability Fords 6 billion investment had to have something to show up for it In my cars case the engine has proven to be superb It appears that I ll have to start saving up for another vehicle fast as I will most likely sell or junk my Contour before its smog test is due next year The Mercury Cougar which has just ended production is an identical design to the Contour Mystique Mondeo series differing only with a hatchback sports car body Even Jaguars new small sedan the X Type is really a Mondeo with all wheel drive and lots of leather and wood I know that I ll stay away from these choices as my next vehicle and suggest that you stay away from anything based on the Contour family Aside from the engine everything else has been a disappointment I never thought 6 billion could result in a car this bad And if I absolutely need the feel of a BMW 325 I will have to take out a mortgage to get a real BMW 325 But I found the owner clubs to be of immature minds who have nothing better to do than to street race just about any car in sight from Acura Integras to Pontiac Grand Ams Moreover despite the Contours European roots many owners were of the isolationist Pat Buchanan types Everything from high fuel prices to traffic regulations was from the liberal globalist conspiracy I often judge a car by the types of people who drive them I believe that driving a certain make and model of vehicle sends out a message about what kind of a person I am especially since I

Neg,The ride in the contour is rough and loud To top it off the service department at the Ford is horrendous On a major expressway it feels like you are riding on Space Mountain We have leased it for 2 years and it has already had 2 recalls The car has been in the shop more than it has been in my garage But after leasing this vehicle from Ford I am ready to go back to the horse and buggy Although you cannot not_purchase not_this not_vehicle not_brand not_new not_I would also discourage someone from buying it secondhand I should start out by letting you know that I do not not_know not_much not_about not_cars The air conditioner is weak at best and the trunk can barely fit a stroller I guess I should commend Ford for discontinuing this model It is extremely limited in space and anyone with small children will regret the day they purchase this lemon Ford has discontinued the model for the 2001 sales year and for good reasons They lack professionalism product knowledge and simple manners I have to spend a lot time at the garage because of this horrible car and I am not not_sure not_if not_I not_will not_purchase not_another not_Ford not_again
Neg,The rear however is a different story The leather seats are also a fine asset On to some positive notes Ergonomics are excellent The other downfall here is the small fuel tank The interior is where my major gripes lie To start the instrument cluster gauges are absolutely tiny The original Mach 1 was almost scary to drive on twisty back roads The 5 speed manual coupled to this DOHC V8 engine makes a great combo Unlike the original however the 03 Mustang Mach 1 is acceptable on these types of roads This interior upgrade package gives you stainless steel pedals an aluminum shift knob and chrome accents At only 15 7 gallons your local gas stations will most likely be your new hangout Interior These seats are both extremely comfortable and supportive good bolstering in both the upper and lower portions of the seats You may want to check out a href content 87909764740 my review on the Nissan 350Z a Thanks for reading As with all Mustangs I have driven all the gadgetry in the Mach 1 is logically placed and easy to use The premium seats found in the Mach 1 are completely different from the less desirable leather seats found in the GT or the V6 powered trim levels Both the driver and front passenger seats offer manual adjustments 8 way driver 4 way passenger Rear seating is unfortunately made of a cheaper type leather This leather visually matches the more expensive front leather seats however there is a definite difference in the texture and quality of the rear seating surfaces In fact other than the optional automatic transmission 815 the only other optional package that will cost you money is the interior upgrade package 445 If anything happens to your Mustang Mach 1 Ford unfortunately offers one of the worst standard warranties on the market a 3 year 36 000 mile bumper bumper warranty Not only is leg room next to none but head room is also limited Having owned a 1998 GT nothing has changed for the better in this department over the years Thanks to a decent amount of torque at a relatively low RPM the Mach 1 never needs to be downshifted while cruising at freeway speeds to accomplish quick passing maneuvers The plastics throughout the cabin also feel overly cheap From the plastic gadgetry to the door panels most surfaces feel like they were taken from an era where interior quality was an afterthought For future reference the redesigned 05 models are said to have a much roomier back seat Note The Mustang Mach 1 can seat up to 4 adults Stowage space is actually not not_as not_bad as some people might think So does the hood scoop really shake at idle like the original Hardly Ford calls it a shaker hood though if you dont not_have not_20 not_20 not_vision not_you not_will not_be not_hard not_pressed not_to not_see not_it not_move Like the original Mach 1 the 2003 version is fast The 03 Mach 1 makes it clearly known by its superior throttle response and its burbly exhaust note at both startup and under full throttle that its not not_just not_a not_stripped not_down not_version not_of not_the not_Mustang not_GT not_trim not_levels The only major gripe I have here are the throws of the aluminum shifter they are far too long for quick shifting The 03 Mach 1s shifter offers throws that are more reminiscent of a 1987 Ford Escorts manual shifter than a post 2000 performance cars 5 speed manual shifter One should note that even though the Mustang does come with a glove box it will probably only fit a few parking tickets Exterior The Mach 1 is definitely a good looking muscle car and by far looks the most aggressive out of the Mustang lineup including the Cobra With the rear 50 50 seats folded completely down the Mustang Mach 1 can easily hold 2 weeks worth of groceries My 98 GT which was equally as roomy enabled me to haul around new computers huge vacuum cleaner boxes etc etc with no problem These instruments are some of the smallest I have ever seen in an automobile produced by FOMOCO Why Ford thought that the muscle car enthusiast would want tiny gauges is beyond me Ford obviously is not not_catering not_to not_enthusiasts not_with not_less not_than not_perfect not_vision There is definitely one thing about the Mach 1 that you can count on a relatively low price With only 2 options available the Mustang Mach 1 tops out at just under 30 000 about 9 000 less than the Mustang Cobra and about 3 000 more than a fully loaded GT 2 door coupe The same excellent power in top gear is also beneficial for extreme hill climbing The Mach 1 accomplished every hill I put it up against up to 6 grades with no need to downshift in fact the Mach 1 was more than happy to accelerate up these inclines in 5th gear The major head turning feature of the Mach 1 is the raised hood with shaker scoop resting at the top The Mach 1 also comes with an air dam larger tires with very attractive 5 spoke Heritage chrome wheels spoiler and large Mach 1 logos to help segregate this car from its less powerful siblings If a Mustang Mach 1 is a must on your shopping list I highly suggest checking out a Mach 1 dressed up in black paint Models that are painted black do not not_carry not_a not_painted not_racing not_stripe not_which not_in not_my not_opinion not_makes not_this not_Stang not_appear not_more not_tacky not_than not_aggressive not_Price not_Warranty An added problem in this department is that the 03 Mach 1 requires premium fuel the GT can run off of regular With gas prices reaching 2 10 in many areas of the world just for regular another 20 cents per gallon for premium is really going to put a hamper on your pocket book It seems as though downshifting into 4th to accomplish these types of road conditions just made for unnecessary engine noise I have never been overly fond of driving the Mustangs on the twisties Despite the grip offered from the big 245 Z rated 17 tires and the upgraded suspension the Mach 1 still feels big around turns If you dont not_like not_the not_sound not_of not_your not_exhaust not_rumbling not_every not_second not_you not_are not_in not_your not_car then you might want to take a pass on the Mach 1 From idle to redline to just cruising at 65 MPH in 5th gear the exhaust and engine rumble can be clearly heard in the cabin at almost all times One of my concerns something I rarely mention in a review is the sound of the frameless doors when they shut they sound like they were put together with plastic and glue I have not not_heard not_doors not_sound not_this not_poor not_in not_quality not_while not_closing not_since not_the not_1st not_generation not_Dodge not_Neons not_rolled not_off not_the not_assembly not_line For more info on standard and optional equipment you can visit www ford com The Mustang Mach 1 might look like a roomy coupe though it is anything but The Ford Mustang remains one of the tightest fits next to the late Camaro Coupe Up front the driver and front passenger should have enough room Being 5 6 and my passenger 6 1 we both had enough room to stretch our legs and necks The shaker hood scoop for the 03 model year is more cute than intimidating as it once was back in 1969 i Cruising through town or on the freeway is not

are still an issue with the Mustang however it seems as though with each passing year the Mustangs ability to keep the driver in a rattle free environment while cruising gets slightly better This is one of the Mach 1s best features to most of the Mustang cult following though I suspect many naive consumers will be overwhelmed by the decibel level in the cabin The Mach 1s robust engine exhaust note is unquestionably a case of you either love it or hate it Unlike many cars on the road that can claim close to the same 0 60 and 1 4 times as the Mach 1 the Mach 1 exhibits some of the best

EPA rating of the Mustang is sort of a laughingstock among V8 powered Mustang owners I have never talked to a Mustang owner who has received over 25 MPG my late 98 Mustang GT averaged about 22 MPG most owners whom I have talked with average between 18 21 MPG highway
Neg,Those air dams are another pet peeve The Mustang retains its burly muscle car appearance They re beefy sporty and fit well with the Mustang style INTERIOR The available on the Premium model 16 inch machined aluminum wheel are a positive though They re not not_functional not_for not_my not_money not_you not_can not_leave not_them not_off not_next not_year The trade offs are iffy quality some slightly old technology in the engine transmission and design and poor visibility It smacks of pretend performance to include the hood intake with those behind each door It is a dramatic step down from the V8 available on the higher end models both in performance and aesthetics The covers on the fake air dams are flimsy and look ready to come off at a moments notice This review however concentrates on the models at the other end of the scale the entry level affordable Mustang Coupe The base Mustang comes with a 3 8 litre V6 which makes 193 hp and 225 lb ft of torque If you have to get the V6 stay with the default 5 speed manual instead of upgrading to the automatic The ABS and Traction Control are also nice and offset a bit the difficulty drivers may experience with the rear wheel drive CONCLUSION Ford includes some decent options Remote keyless entry 6 way power drivers seat and an in dash 6 CD changer are standard in the Premium model The rear end is twitchy and you ll have a hard time getting it back into shape once it goes EXTERIOR The base Mustang comes in three option levels Standard Deluxe and Premium starting at about 18 000 and going up 500 or so with each level ENGINE DRIVETRAIN The leather wrapped steering wheel available in the Premium model is a nice extra touch While on the road a driver unfamiliar with the Mustang may have a few complaints The rear seats are utile but not not_overly not_comfortable not_Children will have no problem sitting there but larger adults will be somewhat cramped especially on longer rides MISCELLANEOUS Wind noise while reduced from earlier model years is still more noticeable than it should be Part of the price you pay for that distinctive appearance The high rear end and sloping windshield into the fake hood air intake give it its distinctive appearance that ensure you wont be confused with any other car on the road They will all cost you though the Ford produced Cobra SVT starts at about 34 000 while both Saleen and Roush make impressive models that will cost 35 000 40 000 or more You maximize the performance of the engine and still get some performance feel with the stick but the automatic is awful Early shifts still some lag when you mash the pedal not not_good That definitely has some appeal in an era when you sometimes cant not_tell not_the not_Jaguar not_X not_Type not_from not_a

trade this is the car for you If true performance is your goal with the Mustang consider stepping up to the higher end models available from either Ford or one of the performance tuning outfits like Saleen or Roush Ford markets the Mustang to a very specific market of American drivers who appreciate the history the muscle car feel and arent looking for a cookie cutter Accord or Camry to drive around For about 20 grand you get a decent ride a distinctive appearance and reasonable power There is a great deal of history to contend with when talking about the Mustang Its appeal to a large segment of American drivers is impressive and to some degree a Mustang lover will not not_be not_swayed not_by not_better not_performance not_found not_in not_foreign not_automobiles thats not not_the not_point Their loyalty is to the Mustang brand first and foremost With that history of loyalty has also come a great tradition of performance tuning these cars so that there are several appealing options available to someone who has some money to spend and wants a true high end performance machine The automatic increases your price by almost 800 so I wouldnt not_bother not_unless not_you

Neg,The front seats are not not_uncomfortable but lateral support came really short of my expectations Exploring the grip limits is a spine bending experience and makes you feel really uncomfortable Turn in remained a bit lazy but the body roll is kept well in control The car equipped with standard 16 inch wheels felt decently planted on its wheels with grippy 225 tires The steering wheel while a tad too big in diameter offers good grip an adequate thumbs in position and is thick enough The rear displays a hint of mobility read tendancy to oversteer although it is quickly tamed by the switchable anti skid control The steering column feel remains quite numb however the steering is not not_overly not_assisted but does not not_communicate not_much not_about not_whats not_happening not_under not_the not_front not_wheels The 4th overdrive gear is as frequently ridiculously long making it really usable for highway cruising but a real annoyance in mid speed winding roads As the overdrive engages as soon as you lift the throttle it makes uphill or downhill driving a frustrating experience 2nd feels too short The instrument panel is clearly laid out looks the business Standard radio CD works decently but the old fashioned telescopic antenna sticking out of the front right wing is anachronic The Mustang goes where it is requested to but there would be about as much feel as with a Playstation game Visually 17 inchers would not not_look not_or not_feel not_out not_of not_place not_at not_all The absence of a blocking rear differential may cause occasional inner rear wheel spin especially on the wet If you are seeking to be the king of power slides in the neighborhood a V8 GT may be a better solution The fabric they are made off is cheap synthetic stuff and the fit between parts forming the dash and central console does not not_leave not_a not_lasting not_impression not_of not_quality not_wide not_gaps not_mistalignment not_leagues not_behind not_german not_japanese or maybe even korean standards If I were to single out the one thing I disliked most about the car it would certainly be the 4 speed or rather 3 overdrive as I later discovered auto transmission Start from the fact that the gear change is located ridiculously far forward on the central console to be naturally within reach The live rear axle is clearly perceivable through occasional sideways wobbles on uneven roads not not_overly not_disturbing at a restrained pace but likely to upset the cars balance at the limit I would say that the chassis is good enough to cope with the 190hp of the base V6 without too much drama but without too much competence and margin either The headlights switch is a surprising design detail I dont not_know if it echoes a feature of the original Mustangs but its looks and its feel are really out of place pulling on this button and hearing a whine when you rotate it to adjust the instrument backlight is the kind of heritage that contemporary buyers will easily want to do without The engine itself is decently torquey max torque is reached at 2750 rpm according to the spec sheet and the car feels that way but for the sake of comparison a GM V6 like the Pontiac GrandAms is far more convincing both in terms of grunt and noise Redline is low 5300 rpm and there is little incentive to rev it up that high the engine does not not_sound not_rev not_happy not_at not_all This entry level version of the iconic pony car looks muscular from the flared wheel arches to the bumped up hood to the angled real lights and the agressive mean front headlights Overall though not not_classy not_or not_subtle I find the shape attractive Loading up luggage is not not_a not_piece not_of not_cake not_the not_boot not_is not_deep not_and not_wide but the narrow opening makes it rather difficult to insert big items A large size suitcase can barely be inserted and as a result blocks access to the remainder of the trunk space While on the topic the glovebox is very small too The only remedy is to play with the overdrive off button concealed on the side of the lever took me a while to discover it Another gripe the car I had was new 3000 miles but the transmission sounded like a 300 000 miles yellow cab with a vacuum cleaner noise in 1st and 2nd gear torque converter which sounded out of place at best worrying at worst Upshifts were not not_too not_smooth not_contemporary not_gearboxes not_can not_achieve not_much not_better not_results not_and not_downshifts not_felt not_busy not_and not_clumsy not_not not_the not_seamless not_power not_on not_demand not_response not_you not_can not_obtain not_from not_german not_or not_japanese not_5 not_speed not_automatic not_gearboxes
Neg,But this car was beautiful What is not not_good not_about not_this not_car not_space Third reason it was a V8 at V6 prices The average speed on Atlanta highways is about 80 MPH It was a shame the drunken redneck ran over it with his pickup truck If you are somewhere icy you probably know that a rear wheel drive vehicle is less stable So who gets the car Young people single people people with good driving records who can afford the insurance What do I love about my Mustang I live in one of the busiest driving cities in America It was the first Ford that said im a Mustang since the early 70s I probably bought the car because of my first Mustang This was my third car and my second Mustang My first Mustang was the 1964 5 I bought from my neighbor on my 16th birthday I loved that car There isnt not_any not_If not_you not_have not_to not_carry not_much not_more not_than not_yourself not_you not_re not_in not_trouble not_Another not_thing not_is not_the not_jealous not_idiots not_I not_have not_actually not_caught not_someone not_urinating not_on not_my not_car not_His not_friend not_was not_keying not_it not_at not_the not_time not_Last not_problem not_rear not_wheel not_drive It was nostalgia as much as anything else Second reason was that I wanted a sports car again I could feel myself aging at the time I was all of 22 and about to graduate from college and I wanted a fun car again before I settled down When I lived in TN during the ice storms I had trouble in some areas and would fishtail While a 360 is fun on purpose it really sucks when its an accident Finally my butt starts to hurt if I have to sit in the chair for more than 4 hours at a time My next car was a 1989 Corolla completely serviceable never had a problem but very boring When I decided I wanted something new my first thought was an SUV I was looking at cars when they drove in a truck full of Mustangs I hadnt really seen the new body style at that time and wasnt not_thinking not_Mustang not_because not_of not_the not_boxier not_ones not_of not_the not_mid not_and not_late not_80s In the left lane you have to do almost 100 to stay alive My Mustang can do that Plus I can dodge the out of staters and foreigners who dont not_know not_how not_to not_drive not_in not_Atlanta and are freaking out in the left lane while driving 55 Third and probably the best thing I can hit the gas on that V8 and leave everyone in the dust well almost everyone If you arent that person or if you have more than two people you carry around with you on a regular basis this isnt not_the not_car not_for not_you not_Update not_Blew not_a not_head not_gasket not_at not_100 not_000 not_miles not_Apparently the V6 also has a problem with this And Ford knew about it and claims they sent out a service bulletin to inform owners but they sent it to the wrong address and I never got it I was just over the extended warranty on it and they wouldnt not_fix not_it not_Repair not_would not_cost not_more not_than not_the not_car not_is not_worth
Neg,If you look around high school and college campuses around the United States you will notice one thing is similar about all of them that is the number of Ford Mustangs parked in the dorms and student parking lots I remember as a younger driver I always wanted a piece of the good old American muscle car and had narrowed my choice to a 68 Fastback and a 70 Mach 1 As my opinions differed and I grew up I noticed that the car I once held on to in my dreams became less appealing to me It was a simple explanation really I wanted to be different and how could I manage that without giving up the Mustang as a car choice Granted up til 96 the engines were 5 0 liter and it seemed that the 89 GT was the fastest GT on the market the one thing I could not not_overlook not_was not_the not_number not_of not_them not_on not_the not_road not_I not_knew not_of not_two not_friends not_from not_high not_school not_who not_had not_consecutive not_models not_of not_mustangs not_one not_was not_a not_95 not_Cobra not_and not_the not_other not_a not_96 not_GT not_4 not_6 not_liter not_and not_that not_really not_discouraged not_me not_from not_buying not_one not_of not_my not_own not_Another not_thing not_I not_encountered not_was not_the not_actual not_materials not_used not_to not_make not_a not_Mustang not_My not_junior not_year not_of not_high not_school not_a not_friend and I were in a car accident involving a Mustang and an Explorer Needless to say i was furious at what I saw constituting as a front bumper on a Mustang styro foam granted it was hard styro foam the fact remained it was styro foam instead of some material more solid For that I made my decision final a mustang was not not_for not_me not_Now not_I not_am not_not not_knocking not_any not_Mustang not_lovers not_down not_for not_their not_opinions but I am saying that when it comes to actual muscle cars of the nineties this old boy will stick with the Chevy Corvette
Neg,The ride is very smooth and the power is fenominal I enjoy the style of this car and its sleek design My friend has a Mustang Coba and he got a special paint job done that makes it three different colors when looked at through different angles One of the best features of this car is that it is a mustang and a mustang is a reliable car which can be trusted to last a long time The front is a great feature wich makes this car stand out som much and this car will make your heads turn the power of this car can really be felt right when you turn the car on and you feel the reve of the engine and the feeling of power under the hood if your looking for a great car at a great price then put the Mustang Convetable Cobra on your test drive list
Neg,Had to be replaced found in many pieces Fan had to be replaced found in many pieces Fan motor blown out Several hoses replaced due to fragmentation and tears September 98 Gaskets replaced for 2nd time found in one piece November 98 Clutch had to be replaced I am the proud well sometimes proud owner of a 1995 Ford Mustang I have found other owners of the same type of car as well However its strange because we have all seemingly had the exact same problems with our cars I bought this car in 1998 and here are the following repairs that ive had done on it since then I bought the car with 42 000 miles on it so it was fairly new August 98 Gaskets Now ive compared this with other reports from other owners of the same car and ive found continuing problems with the gaskets being blown out and parts actually exploding rather than just wearing away I had taken it to several different repair places so that I made sure it wasnt not_just not_the not_Ford not_repair not_centers but it was actually the car ive found another 5 mustang owners of the same year with exactly the same gasket radiator and basically cooling system problems So im pretty much starting to assume that their is a major design flaw in the Mustang and that something needs to be fixed or these cars need to be recalled and looked at Its becoming quite expensive to fix them all I love the Mustang and I know the older cars are worthwhile but im starting to doubt the newer models ive heard more bad than good about the never not_models and their repairs than anything Be very cautious At this time I was at 48 000 miles found in many many many pieces March 99 New tires destroyed when wheels somehow tear through them June 99 Had a total car tune up done spent almost 700 to get car in good shape September 99 Gaskets blown out for 3rd time found in several pieces Hole in Radiator October 99 Gaskets blown out for 4th time found in several pieces January 00 Belts replaced and gaskets blown out again 5TH TIME April 00 New tires needed as alignment mysteriously got put off and the tires were just bought not not_even not_a not_year not_ago and have a 50 K warranty on them Only 20 K miles have been put on car since the tires were bought April 00 New brake pads rotors brake kit etc needed on front and back brakes
Neg,Well Heres your lemon story I bought a 1995 Mustang V6 new from the dealer I loved the car the body style the interior everything At 2000 miles a fuel injector was replaced At 4000 Ford was replacing my engine Not to mention the horror story of the dealership wars After that it was constant I had an electrical short in the tape deck that no one could ever find my oil pressure guage didnt not_work and was replaced the emergency brake was replaced and the window mechanism was replaced 3 times and I still had problems Needless to say the car was eventually bought back and I received a 1998 Mustang V6 ive had this Mustang for almost 2 years and no problems yet Definately love the car Now the only drawback is the snow and ice mustangs are sleds in the winter
Neg,In other words There is noise in the cabin The back seat is not not_comfortable not_for not_friends not_to not_sit not_and not_relax Also he may need to get a second job so he can fill up the tank twice week 25 00 each time It is a temptation that many teens are not not_willing not_to not_pass not_up not_Also not_it not_is not_rather not_small not_inside However it proved to be a very dangerous item on the road I had little experience driving fast cars Buy your teen a relic for his first 4 years of driving After that he ll learn on his own when he sees how many of his friends have wrecked their stangs he might settle into a roomy Nissan Maxima This pony has terrible handling in bad weather A little rain and you will hydroplane all the way to the hospital Its too light on the rear fishtailing became a regular problem I had an accident already on a draw bridge I lost control on that metal surface flooring of the draw bridge PARENTS beware I am now 27 years old I bought a 1995 Mustang 5 years ago I dreamed of having this car since I was a little girl however I really wanted the older models Anyway I ended up purchasing a red one 6 cylinders Very good condition It had only rained for five minutes A little water is all it took and I almost ended up on the canal I purchase tires design to handle better in the rain but it still handles awful A teenager who has never driven a sports car may come to have their first accident in this pony Many young people pull up next to me to race
Neg,Well I for one am personally glad they stopped making the Ford Probe I actually love the look of the car It was the last one on the lot in the perfect shade a green the actual color I had been dreaming about Well from then on it was a jinx Within my first month I had to get a brand new set of breaks because they started squeaking two week after I got the car Afterwards I continued to have minor problems with it such as alignment and so on But I stilled loved the car because it was so cute The performance of the car used to be so good Greta pick up speed ect But the problem you encounter are sickening After talking to some other Probe owners they have all encountered difficulties with the car im really sad that such a good looking car has so many problems under the hood It was my first choice for a new car just coming out of college Back in the early 80s the look of the Probe did not not_really not_move not_me not_But not_when not_they not_redesigned not_it not_I not_totally not_fell not_in not_love not_with not_it not_For not_over not_a not_year not_it not_was not_the not_only not_car not_I not_wanted not_Well not_in not_1994 not_I not_purchased not_a not_brand not_new not_1993 not_Ford not_Probe Then for some reason my engine locked up right after Christmas I could not not_understand not_it not_because not_I not_got not_regular not_maintenance not_Well not_thank not_goodness not_for not_extended not_warranties not_Well not_I not_put not_the not_car not_in not_the not_shop not_to not_get not_a not_brand not_new not_motor not_and not_when not_I not_went not_to not_pick not_it not_up not_from not_the not_Ford not_service not_dealer not_low not_and not_behold not_someone not_had not_hit not_my not_car not_and not_completely not_tore not_the not_rearview not_mirror not_off not_the not_passengers not_side not_Well not_of not_course not_they not_offered not_to not_pay not_for not_it not_but not_I not_had not_to not_bring not_it not_back not_on not_the not_following not_Monday not_so not_they not_could not_get not_me not_a not_loaner not_car not_Well not_before not_I not_could not_get not_it not_back not_to not_them not_Monday not_morning not_another not_car not_hit not_me not_and not_totaled not_my not_car not_Well not_I not_was not_faced not_with not_getting not_a not_new not_car not_and not_I not_chose not_the not_96 not_Ford not_Probe not_Stupid not_me not_Three not_months not_after not_getting not_the not_car not_my not_transmission not_goes not_out not_Completely not_im not_still not_thankful not_for not_warranties not_Since not_then not_it not_had not_never not_really not_driven not_right
Neg,They have nice big white letters You know the area well The rear view mirror was not not_long not_enough The side view mirrors were too small and weirdly shaped It doesnt look as bad though with the body colored grill and bumper On my truck it was just thrown back there haphazardly But one now has a removable carrying case for hot thermoses and other drinks The gauges are all simple and clear pretty much standard issue equipment since the early nineties And those are the only people who would be comfy back there The cast aluminum deep dish wheels are beautiful I believe they had five spokes However it did have clear finely detailed sound In response to my nod he tossed me the keys and said Enjoy the ride There was nothing else in particular I thought I might need The bed was a styleside not not_those not_uselessly not_small not_flareside not_setups not_you not_see not_on not_some not_street not_trucks If it were white I might have trouble distinguishing it from my washing machine The interior was a charcoal grey with black accents for the door handle instrument gauge and the radio housing They re a carryover from previous years and probably my favorite rim that comes with this truck You get engine and oil temperature gauges a speedometer fuel gauge one to measure battery charge and a tachometer The cup holders for those jump seats are an even crueler joke since no one should really be back there The front has been drastically redesigned while the rear is only slightly touched up with a lightly modified tail light treatment All the information I would wish to know A useful twelve volt power outlet is displayed prominently next to the radio This was a four door model which made access to the rear area very easy for placement of groceries and luggage The front makes this truck look far too much like a utilitarian appliance with homely looking headlights on either side of a rather boring looking grill They would have done much better by modifying the front fascia on the 98 2000 Rangers than they did with this one The glove box is deep enough to be very useful but that was about the limit of the lockable hidden storage inside the cab The radio was very easy to use and offered dual media capabilities but it offered flat weak bass It looked a bit more upscale than the lighter colors and the only parts that really looked cheap were the smooth plastics on the black inserts This should be a very convenient way to run power tools and other small appliances off the battery Buttons to operate the power accessories are on the door armrests But nevertheless my curiosity got the best of me and I began to realize its been awhile since I did a review on an actual car The Ranger has now finally improved from liveable to very comfortable with the much improved seating and increased space One of the first things I noticed was the extremely low engine noise levels The jump seats back there are still a joke I wouldnt not_even not_put not_small

pocket in each door A locking bin under one of the front seats would be a welcome touch I did like the special compartment for the jack though As you might guess I was less and less eager to get in the longer I looked at the truck but I had already gone this far Not unhappy mind you but surprised I was standing there while they put on the temporary plates expecting the salesman to jump into the passenger seat but he just said The 15 inch wheels and tires looked a bit small in the wheel wells though Id probably need to go for a 4X4 or an Edge 4x2 with something a bit bigger perhaps some 16 s The first thing I noticed was the vastly improved seats My Rangers 60 40 split bench offers almost no lumbar support causing small aches to develop in my lower back after a couple hours driving The seats on this Rangers 60 40 split bench were excellent for a truck I could feel very good contouring at my lower back right where the seats on previous Rangers got really flat They angled upward sharply on the inside lower corner right at a big blind spot Buttons on the radio were big and fat and clearly marked Its too bad really They felt more like enemies to me Downshift now screamed the throttle My only problem with the tail lights was that it always seems weird to me when the white back up lights are on top of the cluster as was the case here So off it was to my nearest Ford dealership to see what they ve done with my truck I was quite surprised to find that they let me take the test drive alone The tail gate had the same removal system as the one on my truck which is extremely easy and convenient Pop two latches flip the gate to about a 45 degree angle and pull it out The whole thing takes maybe 30 seconds The 2001 redesign is not not_the not_huge not_step not_forward not_it not_would not_seem The truck points where you want it to go with no drama or excess body motions Acceleration The new 4 0 purrs like a kitten and makes smooth refined noises at all speeds None of the coarse boomy quality of the old push rod engines Whos gonna make me huh tough guy Are you is the defiant reply from the transmission The white looks better on the bottom I know I know a strange hang up to be sure but its the way I feel Overall this truck is not not_particularly not_ugly not_or not_repulsive not_just not_boring not_looking Things get quite boring after about 2 seconds though as it gets weaker and weaker towards the mid ranges My advice to Ranger fans considering this truck Hold on to your older Rangers a little while longer It just feels more reassuring when you can hear it go down to the last click when putting it on Overall A for the interior It was much improved Almost all serious shortcomings from previous models were addressed with just a few annoyances left Ride I started it up and pulled into traffic If I get one which is doubtful I will put on real stainless steel tie down bars not not_those not_cheap not_looking not_plastic not_pieces of junk Grade C for the exterior Get rid of those bed mounted tie downs and change the front fascia Interior There was also good thigh support and noticeably more side bolstering Not sports car like by a long shot but it was nice to actually feel the seats curve up just a bit to keep me in place in tight curves The power curve is weak Sure you do get a sharp kick when you floor it from a stand still Any adults who are not not_shaped not_like not_children will not not_be not_happy not_after not_more not_than not_a not_short not_10 not_20 not_minute not_hop not_in not_those not_seats not_which not_is not_about not_how not_long not_it not_usually not_takes not_for not_their not_novelty not_to not_wear not_off It seems almost like a mediocre stop gap measure to fill in until the totally new truck arrives This trucks biggest glaring weak point besides wind noise I just never felt like the 4 0 V6 and the automatic transmission were working as a team Wait until the complete redesign coming up in 2003 to see if the Ranger can regain its greatness One thing I would like to see on the Ranger that ive found in the Tundra but no other four door pickup is handles on the outsides so you dont not_have not_to not_go not_though not_opening not_the not_front not_door not_first not_to not_get not_the not_rears not_open The cup holders for front passengers are still in a bad place placed on the floor of the cabin where they re difficult to reach Id prefer a setup like I see on some S10s where they unfold from the front of the center console In fact I thought I could do without the cruise control which I personally dont not_like not_to not_use but it was a nifty feature for those interested All in all a very good bargain considering that it stickered for 18 600 Exterior im not not_too not_pleased not_with not_it not_to not_be not_honest This is one loud truck I believe the wind noise would slowly drive me insane on long trips and that damn stereo isnt not_even not_powerful not_enough not_to not_overcome not_it not_Small not_bumps not_were not_well not_damped not_and not_never not_particularly not_jarring It took me awhile to figure out what these weird looking things on the side bed rails were I dont not_know not_if not_Ford not_was not_trying not_to not_come not_up not_with not_some not_sort not_of not_futuristic not_looking not_tie not_down not_bar not_or not_what not_but not_it not_seems not_like not_they not_re not_for not_style not_more not_than not_anything not_else They were big clear and easy to figure out Visibility was a big problem though I get really annoyed nowadays at what seems too much of a willingness on the part of manufacturers to sarifice safety for style Sleek tiny side view mirrors may integrate well with a cars body but they make for anoying blindspots The noises that really got to me came from wind My 95 does not not_push not_air not_as not_loudly not_at not_over not_90 not_mph not_as not_this not_one

seemed to require fewer twists of the wheel in tight turning Braking was always straight and secure though the brakes didnt not_grab not_quite not_as not_aggressively not_as not_I not_would not_have not_liked not_on not_sharp not_application not_Handling not_A not_good not_solid not_A Of course its only fair to remind you that pretty much every pickup in this segment except the Dodge Dakota with its forward facing rear bench tells that same joke and you ll have to look at the extended cabs in full sized trucks or consider the light duty crew cabs if you want rear seating that is at least endurable in a pickup When I put the key in I noticed that that stupid latch by the ignition that you need to push to release it is finally gone thank god However the foot operated emergency brake no longer clicks when applied something I missed The steering was heavier than on some previous models ive driven including my own allowing for much better road feel and requiring fewer inputs to plot a straight ahead course on the highway I felt just a tiny bit of rear end floatiness at high speeds but it was barely noticeable The big ones really upset the cabin though and even elicited some rattles Ride Gets a B that would be vastly improved if they didnt not_skimp not_on not_sound not_deadening not_materials not_Handling not_Body not_lean was very limited and the truck felt sharp and agile in all situations All the better for you the reader as I was able to get a better idea of performance than if Id had to treat it with kid gloves Equipment and options I drove a 2001 XLT with the extended cab four doors rear jump seats sliding rear windows air power mirrors locks and windows anti lock brakes and the premium stereo with CD and cassette Quite a nicely equipped truck OK I finally went and did it I took a test drive in the redesigned version of my truck I guess I was kind of happy to be blissfully ignorant there for awhile I was so in love with my 95 regular cab Ranger that I didnt not_want not_to not_have not_the not_myth not_shattered not_by not_driving not_the not_new not_one not_and not_risking not_disappointment They look like cheap gaudy body cladding except that it was on the rails instead of on the lower body panels I guess it was an honorable attempt to blend bed rail protection with cargo securing tie downs so I do give them points for that But the tie downs on these rails were actually pretty difficult to use as they were hidden out of sight beneath their protruding lips The engine could use a flatter power curve with more low speed torque and both a manual transmission and an improved automatic C sorry to say Overall tally B but let me emphasize that it just barely missed a C The great ride handling and increased capacity really helped raise the grade In rapid high speed transitions there were no excess body motions Even at over 50 mph it was the same over and over I steered sharply the truck turned to its new course and that was it No bobbing and weaving And whats best on some tire spinning maneuvers that always upset the rear axle in my Ranger this truck stayed composed and glued to the ground The tape deck was a full logic unit with seek and

Neg,It blew What else ooooh yeas the electrical system We have jet skiis and a dual trailer For a truck it handled curves pretty impressively actually The brakes didnt not_last not_as not_long not_as not_they not_should This thing was just one problem after another for ten years It doesnt fit There is no hose that fits When the brakes worked they worked well I could stop that thing on a dime Yes there actually were times in between repairs that I did enjoy driving this little truck The trouble began with the clutch fluid See the thingy is inside the bell housing on the Ranger which is pretty odd This continued the entire trip im not not_sure not_what not_got not_replaced not_finally not_to not_end not_that not_nightnmare but it sucked It was paid off so we kept dealing with it We should have gotten rid of it years ago Go in to the auto parts store and tell em ya want the hose to fit the 93 Ranger sure they have that Errr wait At about 4000 miles it started leaking First we were having to add fluid like every other month then every month then every day The oil was the same way I had to add oil every 200 miles or so About 4 years ago some hoses went out easy enough to replace a hose right It made that decision for us last Monday I had just gotten back from the shop New tires all around new brakes and oil change Got the Safety Inspection sticker on Monday afternoon One year we decided to tow them on down to Key West for Christmas as our present to ourselves About half way there the lights went out We bought a fuse The cloth interior was fairly easy to keep clean and for

all of 5 miles on it By 4000 miles the trouble had begun and they just culminated in a disaster that almost got me killed last week The Ranger is the little truck Ours is a regular cab and regular bed 2 wheel drive 5 speed manuel Nothing fancy or special 6 cyl 4 0 L It got relatively good gas mileage im guestimating about 20 MPG Its a cute little truck resembling the Chevy S10 pretty closely The

Neg,Or no tape deck The am fm radio was tinny and fuzzy All in all a work truck and no more This was a stripped and I mean totally stripped base model It does not not_presume not_to not_be not_a not_commuter not_vehicle not_or not_a not_highway not_cruiser The dash is the older square shape before the interior was redesigned a couple years later But good enough to break up the monotony of lunch break at the construction site Then there was that power steering Wait no im confusing this with post stone age models There were also no headrests which I find unforgivable in even the most stripped pickup made in the 90s Well when I was test driving trucks I drove several late model compact pickups before finally decided on my 95 Ranger XLT Best left to those who need a reliable work horse OK maybe more like a work pony and dont not_care not_about not_any not_options not_or not_frills By the way I see more XLTs at work sites than strippers by far Maybe even working men like their creature comforts The bigger ones were actually absorbed fairly well just a solid wump with the suspension taking a good bit of the punishment before it reached the passengers The flat vinyl bench was well a place to rest your rear end Not much more Not designed for hours of comfortable cruising just plain functional The numbers on the gauges are nice and easy to read with the steering wheel made so the spokes do not not_block not_the not_view not_of not_the not_panel The controls are simple large and easy to read probably because there are no options so you dont not_have not_that not_many not_to not_clutter not_up not_the not_dash Of course the really big pot holes gave me a headache Sound deadening was probably another area where Ford did a little skimping as the engine noise was ever present And those leaf springs with a solid rear axle make for a nice dance number in bumpy corners Ride damping was well truck like Small bumps close together made it dance This truck sits low and is stiffly spung so it leans a little less that you might expect but those puny 195 millimeter wide tires give out fast Just try maneuvering through a tight parking lot and you can get all the workout you need Handling was what could be expected with such a basic suspension setup If you absolutely have to have a truck and its all you can afford go for it with the reminder that this vehicle will not not_be not_much not_fun not_as not_a not_daily not_driver The vinyl floor isnt not_particularly not_attractive not_so not_if not_you not_like not_quality not_looking not_materials not_look not_elsewhere not_but not_it not_should not_be not_easy not_to not_hose not_out not_after not_muddy not_boots not_have not_made not_their not_mark One of them is another Ranger a stripped Base model I found on the same lot At first my parents thought cheap low mileage lets go for it So I had a closer look No air no tape deck vinyl flat bench manual everything dough nut looking little tires and that was pretty much it There wasnt not_even not_any not_power not_steering not_This not_was not_a not_barest not_of not_the not_bare not_bones not_models not_designed not_to not_be not_a not_work not_vehicle It is a work vehicle to be used and abused until it falls apart which should take quite awhile because of the lack of fancy extras or electronics that may be likely to develop problems in the future Me im quite happy that we paid a little more for my 95 XLT with 60 40 split bench and center console tape deck and rear sliding window I strongly advise using some of the money saved by ordering the most basic power train and suspension for interior upgrades You can do it you just have to thrash this truck at 3000 rpm or maybe a little more where it starts to get coarse and boomy I dont not_recommend not_shifting not_below not_fourth not_at not_those not_speeds but it gets tempting as it only pulls in 5th in ideal conditions and it only pulls in fourth over about 70 mph The little 2 3 4 banger does its job well in my truck and in this truck it has considerably less weight to pull so I never felt like it lacked power Merging into street traffic was pretty easy with the 145 lb feet of low end torque that motivates what must be a sub 3000 pound truck Highway merging or passing are a different matter all together It seems like little trucklets like this one are the ones predestined from the factory to become those rough running 200 000 mile little rust buckets with springs that sag from constant overloading But my parents liked the price so I gave it a quick test drive Well what can I say about the interior on this truck Well its a place where you sit The plain flat rectangle and square shapes do not not_bulge not_and not_curve not_like not_the not_dashboards not_on not_later not_models not_so not_everything not_is not_moved not_a not_bit not_farther not_away not_from not_the not_drivers not_reach not_and not_I not_found not_I not_had not_to

break or require extra maintenance but me and my parents ended up deciding it was worth it Just try turning the wheel for the first ten seconds or so after start up before you get going and the steering warms up and effort gets lighter I dare ya With trucks like this who needs to lift weights
Neg,He said They said some fluid leak was normal The dealer said that the transmission had been rebuilt Well the transmission slipped a few times and finally got worse My son bought this 93 ford ranger a month ago and I had my doubts That I found some thing wrong with every car he found When my son asked him about it before the 30 days was up They finally said would order a modulator valve and let him know Talk to several people and see if they recommend dealer or not He checked the gas mileage without the air on and it got a dismal 18 miles to the gallon When a young college student works hard for their money this hurts more than you know The dealer said you probably should get a new trans my son then went to the place that rebuilt the trans He found at a used car dealer dyes in grantsville wv When he took me for a test drive I said that it seem to shift hard aut o It should be against the law for car dealers to make a vehicle that gets less than 30 miles to the gallon SUMMARY dont not_buy not_a not_ford not_ranger not_if not_your not_interested not_in not_fuel not_mileage not_getting not_a not_good not_transmission That ranger transmissions were week and that they had put in a larger pump and it would last longer that way My son asked him if transmission was warranted and yes it was Are state requires a 30 day 50 50 warranty
Neg,My 2000 My initial reaction to this vehicle Other quality issues were more problematic Ranger is my first Ford product in 12 years The standard stereo system has a built in cd player and delivers better than average sound quality The quality of their products has remained the same or dropped in that time period vs the expected improvement The ride is better than expected somewhat choppy but acceptable for a truck especially with a short wheelbase These are problems that I would expect to encounter at 80 000 miles not not_at not_800 not_miles On the positive side the standard bench seats are comfortable and come with a 60 40 split Legroom and headroom is adequate for a 6 0 person As a daily driver the truck is a mixed bag Gas mileage has been disappointing 18 in town 20 on highway vs 22 27 rating Not show stoppers but enough to leave you uneasy about things you dont not_see not_or not_use not_on not_a not_regular not_basis As a truck my expectations were somewhat different vs a passenger car particularly in areas of ride and cab comfort Generally I was pleasantly surprised in both areas This truck initially caught my eye due to its sticker price which seemed very reasonable Unfortunately low price does not not_always not_mean not_value and in this case it didnt However the overall quality level of the truck quickly eroded any positive feelings for the vehicle Some of the quality problems were superficial or cosmetic incorrectly cut carpeting exposed wiring radio knobs that have no start stop points The heater delivers more than adequate heat but does suffer from A C odor problems Dash board control and gauges are easy to read and provide more than standard idiot lights A tach would be helpful with standard transmission models especially to monitor idle levels The truck was delivered with loose front wheel bearings and was badly out of alignment to the point of ruining the front tires within 800 miles due to cupping I have experienced severe vibration in power steering assembly that it intermittent irregular idle and loss of power when clutch is disengaged air conditioning that fails to discharge evaporated water correctly causing mildew in the evaporator box that must be flushed and deodorized on a regular basis
Neg,The ride is stiff and bouncy The power steering pump whines and moans The brakes on this truck are a joke I bought this vehicle because it is a sharp looking truck The power windows jump down in intervals instead of smoothly rolling down The stereo is excellent however the speakers fail to deliver more than an annoying staticky rattle There I have said something positive about it Now lets get to the real important info The air conditioning wont allow you to adjust the temperature on MAX AC to anything but arctic It has been in the shop 7 times for brake problems ranging from flat out brake loss to a leaky master cylinder to the brakes locking up and or failing in the rain The transmission takes it sweet time going through the gears and sometimes missing one or two along the way Whether or not not_I not_make not_it not_to not_the not_end not_of not_the not_lease not_in not_this not_vehicle remains to be seen Having paid almost 19 K for it a year ago and having it only worth 11 9 K in trade now with only 13 000 miles is disheartening Do yourself a favor BUY SOMETHING ELSE
Neg,With gas at 2 00 a gallon I consider this a killjoy on the pocketbook On wednesday of this week it wil be my seventh trip into the dealership to secure my inside roof The gas milage is worse than bad and the promised 22 27 is far from being true in fact it is more like 16 19 if your lucky But the worse part of this Ranger is the lack of response from Ford or our dealership to do anything about the lack of power not not_to not_mention not_the not_cosmetic not_problems I have been the unfortunate victim of Ford ownership I know I have no one to blame but myself but the fact remains I have not not_one not_but not_two Ford vehicles that I wish I never laid eyes on One of these products is a 200 Ford Ranger which was purchased in September of 2000 So since my transmission or interior doesnt have a tech report released by those wonderful engineers at Ford well I have to live with it and all the other rattles and hums this vehicle has and in the mean time I feel stupider than stupid for giving Ford anything but a good cussing So avoid Ford porducts unless you want to live the horrors of Ford ownership like I have for the past year and a half Yes you got it the interior roof is collapsing and no one wants to do a thing about it And living in a desert area I cant not_seem not_to not_keep not_the not_plastic not_molding not_from not_warpage not_no not_matter not_how not_ard not_I not_try not_But not_Ford not_and not_their not_bumper not_to not_bumper not_warranty not_doesnt not_mean not_a not_hill not_of not_beans not_if not_they not_refuse not_to not_act not_and not_honor not_that not_warranty not_as not_they not_did not_in not_my not_case not_Basically not_if not_there not_isnt not_a not_technician not_report not_sent not_out not_then not_there not_isnt not_a not_problem The Ranger is a small truck 4 cylinder to boot so my expections in the power department was pre decided I bought the truck to skiddle around town in and haul a this and that from Home Depot so power is not not_something not_I not_expected not_although not_the not_very not_lack not_of not_power not_is not_something not_I not_never not_expected not_I not_am not_lucky not_to not_hit not_35 not_after not_5 not_minutes not_and not_the not_transmission not_does not_lag not_more not_than not_quite not_a not_bit not_It not_whines not_and not_cries not_upon not_any not_boot not_to not_the not_gas not_pedal not_and not_never not_gets not_up not_to not_speed not_Dont not_even not_attempt not_a not_freeway not_or not_an not_upward not_grade not_I not_believe not_you not_may not_roll not_backwards
Neg,So theres no way to camp out in the Wind Star The ford Windstar reminds me of a nicely made bed with no sheets on it In other words it looks pretty on the outside but there is nothing under all that pretty lace I bought my Ford Windstar for a few reasons 1 I have two active teenagers and a grandson I wanted a vehicle that could also double as taxi for all of their friends 2 I love to travel by car and I thought that this vehicle would save me hotel motel fees 3 I love Lyndsey Wagner LOL First let me tell you I have the 98 version of the Windstar I hate this van Its less comfortable than riding a Greyhound bus cross country it eats gas like you wouldnt not_believe not_15 not_city not_and not_35 not_highway not_ive not_taken not_it not_into not_the not_shop not_many not_times and the dealer always claims that the problem is fixed only to have many more problems ive replaced the brakes more times than I can count and the Windstar drinks up more oil than a sailor on leave Forget windy conditions the Windstar bobs around like a ship lost at sea Last but not not_least the seats do not not_lay not_down not_to not_make not_a not_bed not_they not_fold
Neg,As for the mystery noises that turned out to be many things This time we needed to have a sensor in the transmission replaced He explained that the vehicle that was sold to me was originally designed for mail delivery and not not_highway not_use The salesman listened to what we wanted in a van and made sure that its what we got But I can tell you I look forward to the day when I can get a new van from another car manufacture Things went relatively smooth for a while before we were back to the service dept for mystery transmission problems and more noises coming from under the vehicle The windshield had come unsecured to the van and had to be re glued After an all day stay at the service department we were on the road again Then after about 3 or 4 months of ownership we had a transmission leak After another stay this time overnight we were reunited 8 months after ownership we had to have a rod replaced Now my van is acting up again with the transmission and the service dept cant not_find not_a not_thing not_wrong not_with not_it not_After not_a not_talk not_with not_the not_man not_that not_worked not_on not_my not_van not_I not_am not_no not_longer not_confident not_in not_Ford not_products So at highway speeds it is possible that the van just acts up because the transmission cant not_handle not_them not_Not not_a not_comforting not_thought not_Also not_I not_was not_told not_by not_the not_service not_dept not_that not_Windstars not_are not_known not_for not_having not_to not_have not_rods not_replaced I own a 98 Windstar that was purchased after we learned that we were expecting our second child I spent hours reading consumer magazines and researching full size cars and mini vans I pretty much knew that a mini van would be more up my alley so a larger car never had much of a chance We had another rod replaced the steering column replaced a cracked strut casing and something else that escapes me at the moment Holy cow I dont not_drive not_at not_breakneck not_speeds nor to I beat on a vehicle I have two children in the van most of the time so I cant not_afford not_to not_be not_reckless When we didnt not_qualify not_for not_all not_of not_the not_rebates not_that not_were not_being not_offered not_he not_still not_made not_sure not_the not_selling not_price not_was not_in not_our not_range and we got some decent financing terms After 3 days of debating we went ahead and purchased the Windstar After only having the van for a month or so was when our problems started First it was a little thing Why didnt not_anyone not_tell not_me not_that not_before not_Now not_I not_have not_strange not_squeals not_coming not_form not_under not_the not_hood not_when not_I not_turn not_my not_a not_c not_on not_I not_am not_1000 not_miles not_away not_from not_going not_on not_to not_my not_extended not_warranty not_plan not_and not_I not_am not_grateful not_I not_bought not_it not_I not_fear not_that not_I not_would not_go not_broke not_if not_I not_had not_not not_Unfortunatly not_I not_am not_stuck not_with not_the not_van not_until not_it not_dies not_or not_my not_husbands not_car not_does All that I had read about vans was that the Windstar was what we were looking for but probably out of our price range Was I ever happy to read an ad in our local paper with a local dealer selling them at under 20 000 00 I must say that out of all the dealerships we went to while looking at various vans from different companies the Ford dealership won hands down as far as good sales people
Neg,The fuel economy was a pleasant bonus It has occasionally had difficulty up down shifting at the gear cusp to overdrive about40 mph Why doesnt Ford just re engineer the transmission do a general recall and change the piston This sensor has gone twice once due to a short in the ground the other time for no apparent reason The sensor went due to a short in the ground Interestingly enough the rear wiper uses the same ground and as a result the rear wiper motor was fried The feel of my vehicle is still not not_right not_I not_have not_sporadic not_shuddering not_from not_either not_the not_transmission not_the not_Mass not_Air not_Flow not_sensor not_or not_the not_tie not_rods not_or not_the not_idle not_arms not_etc not_etc It continues to sporadically go on and off while driving d I have had occasional clunking in the front end I brought the vehicle into the dealership and told them I suspected the transmission My decision comes down to maintaining a safe vehicle by dumping money into an obviously sub standard product or getting rid of it and eating a large amount of negative equity I have had the vehicle only 16 months The vehicle above has been traded for a Toyota Corolla Big difference from a minivan small for my family of five but a great little car Maybe Ford should pay out the negative equity that I just had to eat It seems that Ford continue to use a transmission with a known engineering flaw an aluminium piston I had a 94 Sable wagon that had the piston go and the transmission was rebuilt with a steel piston as the replacement When this sensor goes and its over the weekend with no service dept open you have no alternative but to disconnect your battery as the dome light inside cannot not_be not_manually not_turned not_off and if you dont not_your not_battery will run down So what can I do I have 3 children and need the flexibility of a minivan I cant not_afford not_to not_change not_my not_vehicle not_every not_1 not_1 not_2 not_years not_Ford not_Quality not_is not_no not_longer not_Job not_1 not_Epilogue not_I buckled bit the bullet dumped the turkey Any way I look at it keeping it may cost fortune trading it will definitely cost a fortune Either way I as the consumer have been shafted A colleague of mine has a 96 Windstar and just had its transmission rebuilt 52 000 miles They could find no obvious problem but did find loose tie rods and replaced them I am now past basic warranty and have the air bag sensor light staying on 6 seconds past when all other sensors have been initiated at startup According to my manual I need the air bag checked immediately By disconnecting the positive battery terminal you reset the onboard monitoring computer which renders engine diags impossible until the computer relearns your driving habits and can set baselines for diagnostics Maybe Ford and other manufacturers that have the same setup should use a separate backup system battery like the lithium Ion backup battery found in a Personal Computer On the other hand my Windstar has had MANY annoying small problems During the warranty period first 36 000 miles I have had the following problems a Check Engine Light on sensor defect Mass Air Flow Sensor MAF when it goes you re dead in the water improper air fuel mixture it happened at 25 000 miles c Door ajar sensor this one needs to be talked about I am a proponent of domestic vehicles I realize that many imports are reported to have better quality assurance better final product I have never felt that the inflated cost of North Americas favorite imports could be justified maybe now I do My 1998 Ford Windstar L has been a disappointment I live in the country and commute daily to a large metropolitan area for work It is a drive that could be considered easy as it is mostly highway driving on secondary roads at about 55 mph with not not_many not_stop not_and not_gos Because of my commute I put on about 28 000 miles a year I currently have approximately 41 000 miles I require a reliable comfortable and relatively economical vehicle Surprisingly enough the Windstar I own averages about 26 mpg and I have had up to 31 mpg in ideal weather conditions
Neg,What I Love About The design of the Winstar is very functional No one can justify that to me folks My mom got a Caravan and I am jealous We realized that the air conditioning system is totally inadequate for rear passengers It I still maintain that the design of the minivan is an excellent one for transporting people of all ages comfortably If you like the design then may I suggest the Dodge Caravan Both minivans are of a similar design however the new Caravans are more streamlined cool the inside better and the seatbelts are friendly My baby drinks an extra bottle each time we go somewhere because he just gets so hot If you get a Winstar pay extra and get the second A C system or you ll regret it 2 Strangling Seatbelts The Ford Winstar may seem like to answer to all your familys needs but beware there can be some drawbacks to this vehicle that you ll want to consider PS I saved the worst problem for last This is weird but the hubcaps just dont not_like not_to not_stay not_on not_this not_car not_Okay not_you not_probably not_think not_I not_am not_a not_lousy not_driver but after twenty years of driving I have never had to replace so many Of course the Ford hubcaps are 100 each forget that Good luck trying to by nice wheels for it I found out the front wheel drive rims for this baby are a fortune Get on with wheels 5 The Very Worst Thing About the Winstar We live in Texas yes it gets hot here however any temperatures above 80 degrees and the folks in the back get hot and sweaty very quickly I lost track of how many times I would arrive to the store or church and unload my poor soaking wet w sweat kids from the back It is a pleasure to drive the Winstar I like being able to see whats going on in the traffic ahead of me I will confess when I drove my Moms Caravan it did handle better and the back seat can actually switch places with the middle bench seat and give you more options The Winstar does not not_allow not_you not_to not_switch not_the

not_Winstars not_ridiculous not_trade not_in not_situation not_Take not_Care not_Happy not_Motoring not_Love not_Your not_Margarine The hoses for the power steering leak and seem to be prone to developing this Wouldnt you know that you can only get the hoses from Ford and they are expensive too I have been having to add power steering fluid to the Winstar about twice a week or it makes a horrible grinding noise that makes nearby neighbors and pedestrians stop and stare as we drive by Get ear muffs for the neighbors unless you like being noticed alot 4 Flying hubcaps This is the pathetic part With this many problems I wanted to trade my Winstar in for something else I found out that after buying the vehicle 18 months previously and taking very good care of it the Winstar I paid 22 000 for was now worth a trade in of 9000 only 18 short months and 16 000 miles later I couldnt believe it I was so upset I had to stomp out of several dealerships before I realized that this vehicle loses practically half its value when you roll off the showroom floor This has not not_happened not_to not_us not_before but the Winstars seatbelts just dont not_seem not_to not_be

not_person not_problem not_for not_me not_however not_if not_you not_arent not_that not_tall not_watch not_your not_neck not_3 not_Power not_Steering not_Problems Why we bought a Winstar After a lengthly search of all the auto market has to offer for a family of seven to ride in we settled on the Winstar I have owned several Ford vehicles in the past and felt like Quality was still Job this this brand I was torn between the modern looking Taurus wagon and the Winstar Although the Taurus wagon with the fold away jumpseat in the back actually seats 8 we felt like the benefits of the split front driver passenger seat in the minivan would be better for taking care of kids riding behind you What I Hate About The Winstar 1 Inadequate Air Conditioning System Problems began a few hours after we rolled off the showroom floor and the passengers in the back especially in the third seat became hot and sweaty
Neg,Whats your opinion Id like to know This vehicle is going up for sale as soon as the winter is over and that will END MY RELATIONSHIP WITH FORD FOREVER Their customer service is terrible Now this vehicle has locks that dont not_work because I didnt not_get not_there not_6 not_days not_earlier and with only 12 000 miles on it it sounds like the power steering pump is going Let me start off by saying that when I leased my 1998 Ford Windstar it was in July of 1997 I leased it because it was rated number one in overall safety for mini vans that year I leased it for two years and when the lease was up my wife loved it so much that I purchased the vehicle for her This vehicle is now 3 years old and has about a little over 12 000 miles on it When I leased this vehicle I thought it was covered by a five year 50 000 mile warranty I was wrong it is only covered by a 3 year 36 000 mile warranty After three years of driving this vehicle without ever having a problem the electric door locks started to malfunction First the driver side would not not_lock not_then not_it not_would not_not not_open not_then not_the not_side not_sliding not_door not_had not_the not_same not_trouble not_when not_I not_finally not_got not_a not_day not_off not_of not_work not_I not_took not_it not_to not_my not_local not_dealer not_Island not_Ford not_on not_Staten not_Island not_NY not_this not_is not_not not_the not_dealer not_I not_leased not_the not_vehicle not_from not_and not_asked not_for not_the not_locks not_to not_be not_repaired not_this not_is not_when not_I not_found not_out not_that not_my not_warranty not_had not_expired not_6 not_DAYS not_EARLIER They told me they would not not_fix not_the not_locks not_unless not_I not_paid not_for not_them not_I not_was not_later not_lead not_to not_believe not_that not_it not_was not_because not_I not_did not_not not_purchase not_the not_vehicle not_from not_them not_or not_they not_would not_have not_taken not_care not_of not_the not_problem not_I not_came not_home not_and not_called not_Ford not_they not_said not_they not_would not_contact not_the not_dealer not_to not_see not_if not_this not_could not_be not_worked not_out not_and not_I not_should not_hear not_from not_Island not_Ford not_in not_2 not_3 not_days not_A not_week not_later not_I not_contacted not_Ford not_again not_to not_let not_them not_know not_I not_havent not_heard not_from not_the not_dealer not_they not_said not_they not_did not_the not_service not_manager not_refused not_to not_fix not_the not_vehicle not_After not_days not_of not_haggling not_with not_ford not_and not_trying not_to not_go not_up not_the not_chain not_of not_command not_I not_finally not_get not_some not_guy not_who not_tells not_me not_my not_decision not_is not_final not_and not_nobody not_can not_change not_it not_I not_wrote not_a not_E not_mail not_to not_Mr not_Nasser not_the not_CEO not_of not_FORD not_and not_kept not_getting not_answers not_from not_different not_people not_but not_I not_could not_never not_get not_to not_him not_directly
Neg,Obviously im no longer a Winstar fan The first was the older Ford Granada but thats another story Dave This is the second Ford vehicle to let me down The back plastic hatch handle inside broke off several times 14 Tiny hub caps were replaced several times Any longer than 2 4 years and you re in for trouble I purchased a 98 Windstar and unless they ve made HUGE changes I cant not_imagine not_the not_new not_ones not_being not_much not_better I feel compelled to write this so noone else buys a Windstar Maybe these vehicles are reliable for the first few years but then they go bad VERY quickly I suppose the Winstar would work well as a leased vehicle In fact I regard it as the worst money ive ever spent in my whole life The Firestone repairman constantly said the Windstar and the Taurus were the 2 worst vehicles on the road During the past 2 years we NEVER felt comfortable taking the Windstar on a long trip The last trip was 12 months ago through Virginia and we swore the transmission was slipping When we got back home the AAmco guy rebuilt the transmission for the 3rd time Needless to say im done buying Ford and have moved to the Hondas We know a Ford engineer we live in Michigan and she says Ford really cheapens out the Windstar parts Everything is taken down to the bare minimum for nearly every important part The Windstar is a big money maker for Ford During the 6 years of Windstar ownership I went through 1 Strut Replacement 2 Transmission rebuilt 3 times thank GOD for AAmco and lifetime warranty 3 Head Gasket blowout 4 Weird CLONK noise in front when going over bump very loud and nobody could find out what it was 5 Right side door lock made loud craaaaank noise when locked Never fixed 6 Replaced Starter 7 Gas tank gasket seal broke and interior smelled like gas 8 Serpentine belt tensioner pully broke twice 9 Back end continually rattled while driving Never fixed 10 Muffler had an O2 sensor socket blow out Had to have the threaded nut welded back into the muffler 11 Power Steering creeked and was hard to turn Never fixed 12 First 60 days of ownership the vehicle was in the shop for transmission issues nearly 45 days 13
Neg,Very very scary The bolt cover for the optional alloy wheels is huge The van has also had 2 tie rods replaced on separate occasions as well The transmission is fine on upshifts but can be hard on downshifts This happened once to me on the highway doing 120 kph 70 mph The transmission is geared for relaxed cruising Engine revs at 70 mph are around 2400 rpm The engine has lots of low end torque but runs out of steam as revs rise There is a door lock switch in the back hatch area which is handy The rear seat moves forward about 6 inches which adds a bit of extra luggage space This makes for a relaxed ride but ensures the need for a noisy downshift when passing The factory roof rack is flimsy with a very low load capacity I have the rear air option It folds down as well which is useful because removing the seat is such a pain The console adds lots of storage space but makes access to the rear seats from the interior a little difficult The third time they said it was the computer and they reprogrammed it The fourth time they replaced the computer The sliding side door rolls more smoothly and is easier for kids to close than some other mini van doors Sound insulation and ride is okay There is an optional kiddie convex shaped mirror which really helps to keep track on what the kids are doing in the back First the dealer told me that there was nothing wrong with it The second time they claimed it was the O2 sensor It covers 1 3 of the wheel which is ridiculous considering that I spent the extra for the alloy not not_for not_plastic We only use it to cool the van down after it has been sitting in the summer sun Otherwise it can be almost too powerful This van was in the shop 7 times in the first 6 months that I owned it The engine would stall and then it would not not_restart The fifth time they replaced the throttle body and it finally seemed to cure the stalling All of this was done under warranty but it was extremely inconvenient In addition I lost all confidence in the vehicle and ended up driving it in the slow lane etc in case it stalled out again Ford refused to replace the vehicle In the winter there is no rear temperature control we usually turn off the rear heat because it gets too hot We never use the tilting drivers seat for access to the rear seats To allow for this feature the drivers door is extra long which makes it awkward in parking lots Front seats and the optional mid row captains chairs are comfortable but I find the rear seat too hard and flat There is an optional control for the radio for the rear passengers which can be good or bad depending upon what your kids like to listen to I also got the optional center console which has a handy power outlet The power outlet in the console is always on even when the key is out of the ignition which is handy I also got the optional power outlet for the center row seats which is useful for the kids This is on a vehicle with less than 60 000 kms 40 000 miles on it It was also in the shop to fix the cruise control as well Finally I was stranded again with an under the hood fuel leak Other highs and lows Rear seat removal is easy but the seat is very heavy Definitely a two person operation
Neg,The only good thing I can say is that my dealerships repair shop and used car manager have bent over backwards trying to appease me Maybe I just bought a lemon but I will definately think twice before buying another Windstar I bought my 1998 Windstar used in April of 2001 I thought I was making a sound choice I did all of the research poured over articles ran a carfax report and took it to a mechanic Little did I know We had 3 brake jobs done in 4 months only to realize that the hydrolic control unit on my front drivers side brake wasnt not_working not_surprise not_surprise not_this not_was not_not not_covered not_under not_my not_extended not_warranty not_either not_1 not_200 not_Not not_to not_mention not_my not_roof not_rack not_leaks not_so not_that not_every not_time not_it not_rains not_my not_seatbelts not_become not_soaked My van has given me nothing but problems I hadnt had my van for 5 days when I had to take it back to the dealer to get a transmission leak fixed all of the fluid was GONE I then had to replace my serpentine belt which still squeeks Then 4 months later my snap ring sensor on my ABS broke I had to get my camshaft synchronizer replaced not not_covered not_under not_my not_warranty and no mechanic would touch it I had numerous small problems with it that were covered under warranty but cost me 100 00 every time I had to have them fixed I finally thought I was all done with the major repairs then came the brake problems Then my passenger side automatic window stopped working and my rear drivers side window only works half the time I have sunk more money into this van than any other car I have owned im shopping for a new vehicle now because I only have 8 000 miles left on my extended warranty and there is a knocking under the hood that we cant not_identify and it pulls unmercifully to the right ive had it alligned and had the tow checked
Neg,The vehical I own is presently out of commision so my parents are letting me use thier 98 Ford Windstar I am very greatful for them loaning it to me but what a lemon The inside light and dinger does not not_go not_off not_unless not_you not_are not_going not_15 not_mph not_or not_faster and if you get below that speed limit the interior light comes on and the ding ding ding chirps as loud as can be ive taken it in to be looked at more than once and the dealership always gives the van back saying the problem is fixed Maybe I should be gripping about the manufacturer but thats not not_the not_only not_problem not_the not_ride not_is not_really not_smooth not_as not_long not_as not_you not_drive not_70 not_mph not_or not_more not_the not_seats dont not_lay not_down not_they not_fold not_which not_makes not_it not_impossible not_to not_use not_for not_camping not_I not_would not_have not_never not_puchased not_this not_automobile not_I not_wish not_they not_would not_hurry not_and not_fix not_my not_car

Neg,While our instincts told us not not_to not_buy not_this not_vehicle not_we not_did not_anyway The carpet stained easily and was hard to clean Just not not_a not_good not_buy in my opinion Dawn It was easy to move around but had no sportiness or fun when driving I have driven other minivans that I felt were of a much higher quality than the Windstar We bought our Windstar and sold it 3 months later I believe Ford makes a good product but this in my opinion is not not_Our not_Windstar not_rattled not_and not_just not_felt not_cheap not_Having not_drove not_a not_Jeep not_SUV not_before not_the not_Windstar not_I not_missed not_sitting not_up not_high not_and not_didnt not_feel not_as not_safe not_in not_the not_Windstar
Neg,Thats the Ford vehicle info database This could become important later I bought my 2001 Cobra in January 2003 You can move it up and down with your hands There was what some call driveline slop when shifting It shows all repairs done at Ford dealerships and it shows the vehicles warranty status If the car is still under mfgrs warranty have the dealership print you out a copy of the vehicles OASIS report There are other things I should mention like the driverss seat shifting during some cornering and the front bumper is loose There would always be a loud clunking noise coming from the rear of the car Eventually there was a big bang one day and it turns out my rear differential failed The Ford dealership says this is normal I dont not_think not_so not_The not_overall not_quality not_of not_the not_interior not_is not_kind not_of not_cheap not_looking not_with not_lots not_of not_plastic The shifter console is loose around the shifter Just overall low quality Looks like Ford just built a piece of crap car around a good engine and brakes Note to anyone considering buying a used car from a Ford dealership The car has left me stranded twice and it only now has 27 000 miles on it The axle was repaired under warranty and now I will sell the car as soon as possible I will not not_keep not_this not_car not_past not_the not_warranty not_period I missed the power after selling my modified 1991 Mustang GT a couple of years ago My Cobra had 13 000 miles on it so it was practically new I was impressed with the power of the Cobra and the brakes However I had problems with my Cobra There were problems with the warranty repair but thats another story See note at end After getting the car back it drove better Driveline slop was gone I was happy until a month later when the rear axle bearings went out and needed to be towed back home
Neg,Has anyone had this problem occur to their Explorer When my friend arrived he got in and the brakes worked fine Whether under warranty or not not_I think they should take this episode very seriously My tires are dangerous to drive on Hopefully Ford Motors will take care of the damage it caused But I am not not_sure not_they not_will not_as not_the not_car not_now not_has not_50 not_000 not_miles not_on not_it not_and not_no not_longer not_under not_warranty I bought my Ford Explorer because of the way it drove looked and performed Last week I would have given the Explorer an A review When my knees stopped shaking I got out of the car and noticed that the tires were smoking A man on a tracker came by and called for help However coming home from work last week I experienced the fear of a lifetime I always use my cruise control and never doubted that when I put my foot on the brake the cruise control would disengage This leads me to believe that it is a defect in the cruise control Now my Check Engine light is on and the car does not not_idle not_I not_have not_to not_push not_down not_on not_the not_excelerator not_just not_to not_get not_my not_car not_to not_move As I neared the field I noticed that there was a rocky culvert and a barb wire fence surrounding it making it impossible to get to the open field Having slowed the car down to 40 with the emergency brake I was forced to throw the Explorer into Park This was NOT the case last week Instead it went faster I got off the Interstate going about 70 miles an hour I was relieved to be heading for a field where I could not not_hurt not_anyone not_else not_I not_tried not_to not_disengage not_the not_cruise not_control not_on not_the not_panel not_with not_no not_success
Neg,On long trips the lumbar support just isnt not_there and driving can become painful We bought a new Explorer in 1995 and felt we got a pretty good deal after beating on a couple of fleet sales managers They have not not_evenly not_leveled not_the not_vehicle and it is plain to see when you stand behind and look at it It doesnt seem to affect the ride but we dont not_know not_what not_would not_be not_an not_obvious not_sign not_that not_it not_needed not_repaired not_other not_than not_just not_looking not_at not_it not_One not_other not_real not_down not_side not_to not_the not_vehicle not_is not_the not_ride We never thought that there would be the same problem with the Explorer but at 8 K miles guess what After coming to a full stop the transmission locked up and it wasnt not_going not_to not_go not_anywhere Fortunately the warranty covered the replacement and we were off to see the sights of Oregon Since then the only problem we have encountered has been the automatic shock adjustment for different types of roads Some of the reasons we purchased the Limited are we liked the leather option for the seats the privacy glass for all but the driver and passenger windows I really liked the interior door lock by the back interior door the ability to lower the back seats and move the front seats all the way forward to accommodate my 6 3 frame if I wanted to sleep inside the vehicle it was not not_as not_tall as most all of the other SUVs so it would fit in our not not_so not_tall garage the shift on the fly four wheel drive option and the classic lines that didnt not_look not_like not_a not_GM not_product not_Now not_mind not_you not_I not_have not_had not_a not_couple not_of not_other not_Ford not_products not_and not_had not_the not_same not_problem not_with not_at not_least not_2 not_of not_them not_THE not_TRANSMISSION
Neg,Do not not_waste not_your not_money not_on not_this not_car We bought an Eddie Bauer Ford Explorer in 1995 In the winter of 97 the car had 46 000 miles It will fall apart on you and Ford will not not_care We loved the interior of the car and the way the car looked We were moving to the Bay Area for 6 months and had rented a small U Haul We have found out since then Ford has awful issues with their transmissions We bought the car with a tow package and routinely used it to tow a popup camper We even Federal Expressed a letter to the president of Ford about this issue 3 months later we received a form letter Check out all the web sites about this We sold the car immediately and have since owned a Mercedes M Class Great drive and great tow and a Chevrolet Suburban 2000 WONDERFUL My husband was driving the car out to California when in the middle of Nebraska the transmission gave out A Ford Dealer came out tow the car into the dealership His comments to my husband Didnt you know you cannot not_tow not_with not_a not_Ford not_We not_had not_to not_totally not_replace not_the not_transmission not_on not_this not_car not_All not_attempts not_to not_contact not_Ford not_to not_help not_with not_the not_payment not_were not_met not_with not_denial
Neg,One week after we bought the focus the car died on a busy freeway The research albeit a limited internet search told of a car which was inexpensive safe well built and sporty After reading the positive reviews posted on epinion I thought I would share my negative experience with consumers For those who are looking to buy do the research Please heed my warning and dont not_risk your time and money into a Ford focus For those who love your focus I am jealous I wish I could spend my weekends some place other then Ford service centers It seems the Ford focus is a hit or miss model the cars built right run fine but those that miss the mark are unreliable and a hazard on the road We bought a new Ford Focus three months ago June 2002 in Las Vegas And considering the car has been in the shop for almost half that time doesnt bode well for Ford reliabilty Fuel pump problems seem to be our burden but other focus owners have different but equally disappointing problems with their vehicles Something common to all focuses though are brake problems It was repaired and returned in two days Trusting the reliability of a new car we drove from Nevada to Tucson where it died again on a stretch of road called properly termed Dead Mans Highway in the middle of summer Anyway this type of incident occurred twice more since we ve owned the focus The problem cannot not_be not_fixed and Ford denies there are any design flaws A website dedicated to filing a class action lawsuit against Ford www fordfocusbreakproblems com might be of further help Also read the negative reviews found on carsmart com I believe my idea of a hit or miss car will be clear from the reviews posted on that site Car rental companies with focuses on their lot are told to replace brake pads at 15 000 20 000 miles because pads fail like clockwork Car owners unfortunately are only given a warranty on brakes for 3 years or 12 000 miles so replacement pads are an out of pocket expense A repeated problem continually found on focus complaint records are brakes that squeal and grind
Neg,Over all this van is not not_a not_very not_good not_vehicle It has seating for seven and a large cargo area When its working it has good acceleration and horsepower It doesnt get good mileage and it gets pushed around by the wind You can choose between a 4 cylinder a 4 0 V6 or a 3 0 V6 I have a 3 0 version It burns up master cylinders and transmissions I personally would like to set mine on fire because it is not not_running not_well not_My not_Aerostars not_air not_conditioning not_hasnt not_worked not_in not_two not_years The Ford Aerostar minivan is one of the worst minivans ever made Its not not_dependable not_it not_constantly not_needs not_repairs not_and not_is not_not not_something not_you not_want not_to not_stare not_at not_The not_only not_good not_thing not_about not_it not_is not_its not_engine not_selection
Neg,The front seats are plush and comfortable The stereo system is an iffy item The back seats also folds down to expand the trunk room for hauling larger items The air conditioner and heater work well but sometimes seem slow to kick in While the Ford Taurus is a comfortable and rather inexpensive car it wont get high ratings from our family The back seat is roomy enough for children fits two car seats easily but the middle seat is hard and uncomfortable If you use any brake pads other than the Ford ones they squeal squeak and squawk within a thousand miles The trunk itself is fairy large not not_quite comparable to the roominess of a VW Jettas trunk but still plenty of room for playpens or groceries The disc pads do not not_just not_go not_in not_with not_a not_C not_Clamp either you have to buy a special tool that looks like a little block An arm rest can be brought down in the middle and theres even a lap shoulder belt for the middle seat but it feels like you re sitting on a rock hard surface True to form this car has lived up to the FORD reputation of Fix Or Repair Daily Bought used after our beloved Jetta was totaled in an accident this car seemed promising at the start This makes a simple job a pain to complete Overall while the Ford Taurus may be inexpensive fairly comfortable and feature decent power it is no fun to constantly be repairing something or trying to figure out just what is squeaking this time This Taurus needs to be put out to pasture On one hand it has decent sound and provides enough bass to make most music palatable while on the other hand it is part of the console and pretty much irreplaceable I wouldnt not_advise not_buying not_this not_car not_if not_you not_re not_the not_type not_to not_pop not_stereo not_systems not_in not_and not_out not_However not_nice not_the not_amenities seemed at first we started having problems with it It features a faulty Ford transmission thats always begging for repair slipping in and out of gear
Neg,We purchased a new Ford Taurus in 1996 The car is once again returned to us In the first 3 year we owned the car it was to the dealer several times for minor repairs The very first time I drive it the check engine light comes on and I smell radiator fluid It was taken back to the Ford dealer and low and behold it had a blown head gasket 1000 00 When the car was returned to us with the new fan we noticed our heater was no longer working Then once again the speedometer had to be replaced at a cost of approx 200 00 Over Thanksgiving weekend 1999 the fan that cools the motor went out It was taken to the Ford dealer for repairs at a cost of 200 00 The speedometer malfunctioned and had to be replaced and the alternator went out The major problems began after the car was out of warranty and had close to 60 000 miles on it The rear engine mounts were the first to go with repair costs being close to 800 00 The car goes back to the dealer and this time has a split radiator with the cost being 200 00 I am almost scared to drive it now I really like this car due to the fact that it has a great safety rating and it is a very comfortable car to drive and ride in However I would recommend that you trade it in before it goes out of warranty
Neg,Other than the seats The dealership replaced several electrical components before the problem went away The engine would just quit while cruising on the freeway The rest interior is very roomy and quiet at any speed Headroom and legroom are plentiful The dash is made of high grade plastic and rattle free even after 75 000 miles At approximately 60 000 miles most of these cars began experiencing transmission slips or lurches The trunk will swallow just about anything even plywood with the rear seats folded down Dont purchase this as a used vehicle unless you are a mechanic or have a mechanic buddy The interior appears to be well thought out with one exception the terrible ergonomics of the front seats The Taurus I am driving is a company car assigned to me a little over 2 year ago Three of my colleague of various girth who also drive the Taurus complained the same of the GLs base seats The rounded windshield rounded rear window bug eyed headlights and the smiling mouth grill opening combine to make this a cartoon of a car INTERIOR 5 We spent 1200 on one of these Just last week the mass air flow sensor some component for emissions control and engine regulation went out on mine The following information should be useful for someone who is considering purchasing one as a used car EXTERIOR 3 My white Taurus looks like an albino sperm whale The part itself costs 400 VALUE 4 The depreciation on the Taurus is horrendous from 20 000 to 5000 in four years THE VERDICT A VERY GOOD CAR WHEN NEW WITH UPGRADED SEATS There is no lumbar support or side support ive developed chronic aches in my shoulders from leaning on the fold down center console and the inside of the driver door I am 5 5 and weigh 125 lbs Perhaps the seats were designed for much wider drivers The lift over height may be low but the wide tail lamps reduced the trunk width ENGINE 8 The 3 0 liter V6 accelerates very nicely and provides excellent fuel economy for a full size car nearly 30 MPG freeway HANDLING 8 Sometimes forgetting that this is not not_a not_sports not_car not_I not_would not_take not_some not_curves not_too not_fast not_The not_Taurus not_is not_very not_forgiving not_however not_in not_response not_with not_some not_body not_roll not_and not_tire not_squeals not_Very not_good not_handling not_for not_an not_American not_sedan not_RELIABILITY not_3 not_My not_company not_purchased not_about not_20 not_of not_these not_vehicles not_and not_reliability not_has not_become not_an not_issue not_One not_Taurus not_definitely not_a not_lemon not_was not_in not_the not_shop not_3 not_times not_within not_a not_one not_year not_period not_for not_the not_same not_problem
Neg,They do not not_care In fact it keeps getting worse So beware of buying a Ford the warranty means nothing to them THEY DO NOT CARE They cant and they dont not_care not_who not_they not_hurt not_as not_long not_as not_they not_make not_money not_at not_the not_customers not_expense But they offered me 8500 to 9000 for my car that had a sticker of 25 250 only 2 years ago We dont not_want not_to not_put not_any not_more not_money not_into not_your not_car not_so not_we not_ll not_give not_you not_3000 not_off not_a not_new not_one not_to not_trade not_out not_of not_your not_car You have to exert a considerable amount of effort to the steering wheel to stop the pulling which gets worse the faster the car is going Now the service manager say My two year old Ford Taurus has been in for service ten times for the same steering and alignment problem Each time the service manager says Its fixed as they always replace some suspension component BUT its never not_fixed My advice Ford makes nice interesting cars but when they make a bad one they dont not_care not_The not_Ford not_Customer not_Assistance not_Center not_CAC says you have to take these issues up with the dealer I told them my warranty is from Ford Thats another way Ford gets to make money on you they try to shift their problem to you even though you have a warranty and they believe you should pay them for their incompetence and total disrespect for their customers They will not not_provide not_a not_loaner not_even not_though not_its not_under not_warranty and has been out of service at the dealer for OVER 60 days now I like the car based on its styling size features etc but now my wife will no longer drive it its just too difficult to keep it going straight What I think they would then sell this car on their used car lot for an additional profit of course and cause another customer to suffer with it like we did If they could fix it before putting it on the used car lot why wouldnt not_they not_fix not_it not_for not_me not_ANSWER
Neg,No way would I ever recommend to anyone a Ford Taurus I have a 1996 and have driven a 1999 It is easy to see that Ford is perfectly happy to create an inferior product to sell to the Us public The only good quality this vehicle has is that the ride is very smooth although the front end assembly clunks when you hit the slightest of bumps In 1 1 2 years I have replaced the entire front end assembly three 3 times replaced the transmission and replaced the cam sensor due to hard starting None of these repairs have fixed any of the problems with this P Os I have written several letters to Ford to express my deep displeasure and concern with an inferior product and to my dismay no responses were ever given I purchased a 1996 Ford Taurus program car with 18 000 miles on it From day 1 I have regretted that decision and will until I am rid of this lemon I use my vehicles heavily and in the last year and a half I have put 60 000 miles on it I maintain my vehicles well but for this car it didnt not_matter
Neg,It is just not not_the not_perfect not_family not_size not_vehicle not_we not_thought not_a not_stationwagon not_would not_be We bought this 96 vehicle in 98 with 30 K miles and it only has 40 K miles now but it already has problems starting on occasion This car is okay but not not_at not_all not_what not_I not_had not_anticipated not_I would classify it on the smaller end of mid size car at least in the passenger seating area Maybe because mine is a wagon they moved everything up to make the wagon end bigger I dont not_know But to fit 5 people in is very cramped Also it is a V6 but lacks any ooomph in its acceleration On the upside I think it is a decent looking car for being a wagon and the rear seats fold down for more carrying area when needed Mine has the third seat in back too which will come in handy down the road For a smallish person like myself the car is actually perfect I get lost in a mig car anyway

Neg,The problem was that a freeze plug had corroded so badly it finally gave way The mechanic informed me that there was also a lot of rust in the cooling system She called me and I had the car towed to the nearest service station that evening Then one day my wife was driving the Taurus with my 2 children buckled in the back seat when the engine overheated badly She found a place to pull over as the steam came pouring out from the cracks under the hood The very next day on my way to work coolant came pouring out of the block and the car overheated for the third time I bought my 1996 Ford Taurus at a dealership in Powhatan Virginia because I loved the way it handled and the way it looked In addition I spoke with other Taurus owners and was told that you couldnt beat the Taurus 3 liter engine for dependability I was a happy owner for the first 2 years It was my contention that since I have it documented at the dealership that I was having coolant problems all along that I was not not_out not_of not_warranty not_at not_all He replaced the freeze plug and flushed the cooling system About 2 months later I had the same problem rusty water pouring out of a badly corroded freeze plug I took the car to my regular mechanic and he informed me that there was a recall on my Taurus for which I was never notified It is also my contention that my 1996 Taurus was doomed the day they manufactured the engine without treating the block with a rust inhibitor Ford Motor Company had to know that the 1996 Ford Taurus would experience catastrophic problems before 100 000 miles I will never purchase another Ford product again and I suggest that anyone reading this follow suit The reason I was given for the recall was that Ford had manufactured the 1996 Taurus 3 liter engine and installed it in the vehicle without treating the inside of the block with a rust inhibitor I had the vehicle towed to the nearest Ford dealer and they reimbursed me for the freeze plug that I had had replaced at the service station treated the block and replaced the most recently corroded freeze plug The dealer had the vehicle towed back to the shop and replaced the remainder of the freeze plugs over the course of the next 2 years I had the vehicle back to the dealership 2 times complaining that my temperature guage was going up almost to the red when I was idling and would go back down when I was crusing Each time the service manager informed me that he could not not_duplicate not_the not_problem He said he would try to get the Ford factory rep to pay for all but 500 of the repair but that I should call the 1 800 392 ford Customer Service line I called them and spoke with a lady there who informed me that Ford would have paid for the engine up to 75 000 miles but that since I had 83 000 miles on my vehicle that Ford would not not_pay not_anything The Taurus now has 83 000 miles on it For the past few weeks I had noticed that it had a slow coolant leak I took it back to the dealership 2 days ago Yesterday the service manager called to say that he needed to pull off the power steering pump and the alternator to find the source of the leak After doing that he called to say a freeze plug had to be replaced once again and that Ford would not not_be not_paying not_the not_bill not_because not_my not_warranty not_was not_expired not_I not_agreed not_to not_pay not_at not_a not_reduced not_labor not_rate not_for not_the not_repair not_After not_replacing not_the not_freeze not_plug not_he not_called not_to not_inform not_me not_that not_it not_was not_still not_leaking not_He not_said not_that not_it not_was not_his not_opinion not_that not_I not_should not_replace not_the not_engine not_rather not_than not_sink not_any not_more not_money not_into not_the not_rusted not_one
Neg,My advice stay away from this car due to this head gasket problem One thing I like about the car is its smooth ride Id been driving this car was pure nirvana to drive At approximately 60 000 miles the engine suffered catastrophic head gasket failure and completely toasted the engine Heres everything I have nice to say about this car I purchased my 1994 Thunderbird from a Seattle car dealership 6 months ago The engine had to be replaced to the tune of 4200 but in my case the bulk of this was covered by the extended warranty I purchased Fords reconditioned engines address this head gasket problem The 94 T Birds did have a Ford Customer Care notification on record not not_exactly a recall but something just short of that because of the problem they were having with blown head gaskets Unfortunately this notification is no longer valid on 94 T Birds My car has cloth seats leather wrapped steering wheel and shifter power drivers seat adjustment power mirrors overdrive cruise control and for speaker JBL factory stereo with cassette Sound system is OK and now that everyone has CDs the system is a candidate for upgrading Now for the bad news buyer beware The suspension is not not_so not_soft not_that not_you not_feel not_detached not_from not_the not_road not_but not_far not_more not_comfortable not_than not_a not_subcompact not_like not_my not_Ford not_Escort not_a not_great not_little not_econobox not_by not_the not_way but thats a future epinion Fit and finish of the car is above average Seats are comfortable without being overly soft Leg room is ample in front but in back is only adequate It was in impeccable condition and had 38 000 miles on it The previous owners were a retired couple who had kept the car garaged the entire time they had it They elected to trade it in because they wanted a full size Buick Purchase price for this vehicle was 7800 and the original sticker price for this V6 equipped version was 17 000 I would have never anticipated buying a Ford Thunderbird this old but the low mileage and condition of the car were what sold me Compared to the 1978 El Camino
Neg,At this point I have surrendered To my great joy I found a 94 T Bird used with only 18 k for almost half of the new price It also started making some noise due to a bad catalytic converter and some undiagnosed squeaky rattle coming from somewhere in the front brakes The maintenance nightmare has worn away even the most optimistic and forgiving parts of my deep desire to love this monsterous piece of metal In summary I did manage to get almost 100k miles out of the car though I probably sank more money into it than any logical person would Let me start by saying the first time I laid eyes on this car I fell in love with it The exterior styling was sharp yet not not_outlandish The interior was in my opinion absolutely perfect I could not not_imagine not_the not_controls not_being not_any not_easier not_to not_reach or more intuitive to operate I especially drooled over the automatic climate controls It was the V6 and the color was terrible but it still seemed like a divine gift of fate I loved the car for the first couple years I had it not not_a not_single not_notable not_problem not_Until The times when it was running problem free it WAS a dream to drive and I still hold to the belief that much of the car is of the highest design and ergonomic caliber The death blow was dealt by yet ANOTHER problem with either the head gasket at close to 60k on the new motor I thought this problem had been remedied at the time it was replaced guess I was wrong or possibly intake gaskets in that vicinity Why do more cars not not_have not_this not_feature not_Even not_the not_shifter not_knob not_seemed not_to not_fit not_right not_into not_my not_hand not_Though not_at not_the not_time not_I not_could not_not not_afford not_it not_new not_I not_test not_drove not_it not_the not_V8 not_version not_and not_loved not_the not_way not_it not_picked not_up not_and not_handled not_I not_wanted not_wanted not_WANTED not_this not_car not_A not_couple not_years not_later not_I not_totaled not_the not_car not_I not_did not_own not_in not_a not_huge not_snow not_caused not_multi not_car not_pileup not_I not_needed not_a not_replacement not_immediately In 2000 with almost 60 k on it the head gasket blew Just like the previous review mentioned it was covered under an extended pseudo recall plan because it was such a common problem in the V6 models To Fords credit the motor was replaced completely with no cost to me AND with a little coaxing they actually gave me a loaner to drive for the entire time it took to get the motor there and installed several weeks But the incidence of MAJOR mechanical problems with the most essential and expensive parts of the car are absolutely unforgivable I have not not_heard not_any not_of not_these not_complaints not_with not_the not_V8 not_version not_only not_with not_the not_3 not_8L not_V6 not_If not_you not_have not_one not_of not_these not_and not_you not_have not_not not_yet not_had not_problems not_not not_likely not_9 not_years not_after not_production not_then not_PLEASE not_do not_what not_you not_can not_to not_either not_get not_rid not_of not_the not_car not_or not_get not_it not_serviced not_before not_it not_self not_destructs not_I not_really not_wish not_that not_cues not_could not_be not_taken not_from not_the not_interior not_of not_this not_car not_and not_many not_of not_the not_EXCELLENT not_intuitive not_features not_and not_transferred not_to not_other not_vehicles not_but not_as not_much not_as not_I not_once not_loved not_this not_car not_I not_cannot not_recommend not_anyone not_to not_do not_anything not_but not_avoid not_it not_like not_the not_plague At the time I chalked it up to a bad engineering flaw which they atoned for at their expense Until 6 months later the transmission died I was kinda tight on money at the time and rather than dropping almost 3 grand to have it completely rebuilt I opted to replace it with a used one I realize the risk I took but I figured it was the best I could do and took my chances THEN in 2002 THAT transmission died on me I much considered dropping the car right then but I had JUST paid it off a couple months before and in spite of my better judgement a part of me still loved that car A few months passed and other minor problems popped up which I attributed to age including a brake cylinder blow out which luckily happened at parking lot speed and was fixed rather cheaply and less notably a bushing in the front steering assembly that rotted away due to winter driving and some hard braking on my part
Neg,Where is your Reference Point However its acceleration is by todays standard very poor Also my accelerator pedal sticks in the morning so pressing it harder makes it jump initially However if you have been driving a 2000 VW Bug this is a giant stepping down for its sluggish acceleration noisy interior and sheer ugliness The 4 cylinder engine gets less than 20 mpg for combined city and highway driving making you to think it has good performance There you get the picture of Relativity The Ranger I drive has no optional equipment other than its 4 speed automatic transmission Then again if you are used to a pick up like F 150 just forget about getting a Ranger as you will be dreadful In another words it is very uncomfortable to drive more than 30 minutes or so For me a seat comfort is the number one importance more than any others I am in a construction business that forces me to move from one area to another as projects end With a new project assignment comes a new company vehicle This time its a 2000 Ford Ranger a step down from my previous Ford Explorer Needless to say I was not not_happy not_for not_this not_downgraded not_vehicle not_at not_first not_especially not_with not_the not_stripped not_down not_absolute not_base not_Ranger not_model It definitely has rear spots that are harder to check Again I drive it because its free not not_because not_I not_like not_it not_If not_you not_are not_a not_truck not_person not_then not_this not_could not_be not_a not_no not_non not_sense not_worry not_free not_vehicle This problem goes away after the engine warms up While driving it is fairly easy handling is not not_Making not_a not_turn requires a gentle touch needing to come to almost a complete stop Forward visibility is good because its higher sitting position but I was quite surprised to find out how difficult it was to check my blind spots It even come with manual window cranks that I thought have long gone away from automotive industry A pickup truck is good for carrying stuff from hardware stores to my new home Its just convenient to throw things in the back and go as long as its not not_raining If it rains theres not not_enough not_room not_to not_put not_anything not_inside not_the not_cab not_And not_for not_the not_obvious not_reasons not_its not_not not_convenient not_to not_shop not_from not_store not_to not_store not_as not_your not_purchases not_are not_exposed not_to not_open not_area not_unprotected not_My not_Ranger not_came not_with not_a not_standard not_vinyl not_bench not_seat not_and not_this not_is not_definitely not_a not_back not_killer not_for not_longer not_drives But its free so I dont not_complain not_I not_must not_confess not_that not_I not_am not_not not_a not_truck not_person not_so not_I not_probably not_would not_never not_buy not_one not_with not_my not_own not_money not_I not_have not_ridden not_a not_Ford not_F not_150 not_that not_is not_much not_nicer not_than not_a not_Ranger not_but not_I not_would not_still not_prefer not_a not_car not_or not_an not_SUV not_over not_a not_pickup not_truck not_I not_understand not_that not_some not_people not_are not_just not_the not_opposite not_we not_are not_all not_different not_Another not_fact not_is not_that not_it not_is not_difficult not_to not_like not_a not_cheap not_vehicle not_once not_you not_have not_gotten not_used not_to not_a not_more not_expensive not_one not_Liking not_a not_particular not_vehicle not_is not_therefore not_all not_Relative not_to not_what not_you not_have not_been not_used not_to not_If not_you not_are not_stepping not_up not_to not_a not_Ranger not_from not_that not_1970 not_VW not_Bug not_you not_will not_love not_the not_improvements not_such not_as not_acceleration not_quietness not_etc
Neg,I have a 91 Ford Taurus 3 0L AXODE in Silver Grey The car handles very well is low and wide and I never feel unsafe driving This car is excellent for a family of four and has plenty of leg room and for a 91 a well designed ageless feel to it The car has 200000 km At least you still have service life out of the car and did not not_pay not_much not_for not_a not_decent not_family not_car not_Check not_out not_the not_web not_carefully not_for not_upcoming not_class not_actions not_and not_general not_comments not_on not_this not_car If you own a Ford expect niggling problems and possible major component failures I suggest you invest in a web based extended warranty and buy a 2 3 year old product It was the first attempt by Ford to use Dr Demings Japanese quality theory Its still going however I do use rust check spray every other year to stop salt damage in the Canadian winter It also helps if you are a bit of a do it yourselfer and are able to figure out what might be the problem before you go to your chosen independant local mechanic All being said however for a second hand vehicle I paid 10000 and ive owned it 8 5 years I think I have had overall value for money but I do not not_like not_the not_shoddy not_transmission They suffer from weak transmissions clutch failure and lube tubes All Taurus Sable and Windstar are prone to expensive repairs I have had to replace the transmission at 130000 km and 6 5 years Ford attitude is unacceptable even though they extended the warranty I should have been a total recall Once the warranty is over Ford are not not_interested not_in not_further not_compensation The car still has original alternator steering radiator fuel system engine computer emission control convertor front shocks engine wiper motor master cylinder fuel pump tank I had to replace the transmission below starter failed relay brake booster front bearing front CV right muffler tie rods inner and outer front bearings water pump 2 plugs wires cap rotor battery A C clutch A C seals Apart from the transmission I consider this all normal wear and tear Now the A C has failed Last year there was a musty odour and perhaps the evaporator has failed Regardless it will cost 1500 2000 to fix and is simply not not_worth not_it not_at not_this not_age not_A not_C not_must not_be not_the not_most not_unreliable not_part not_of not_any not_car not_Transmission not_Failure not_Avoid not_cars not_with not_the not_3 not_8L not_engine not_gasket not_failure not_and not_all not_cars not_from not_1991 not_onwards
Neg,The same with my motor mounts The change holder was very conveniently placed right under the radio When my brakes did work the anti lock system proved to be very effective It was the type that would just push right into the dashboard There was a dead spot in the steering wheel of about an inch in each direction The trunk is spacious and the only downfall to that is things can get lost easily in there My motor mounts have cracked open twice both time when I was driving My alternator died twice again when I was driving When I finally got rid of my car the transmission was dying again and it has only been seven months since the last time it broke One time my break pads actually fell out about three months after i had them fixed Other problems that reoccured with my taurus is the transmission and motor mounts I had to replace my transmission two time in eight months My air bag did not not_go not_out but that might have been because of the angle I hit the car at Neither my passenger or I was hurt at all despite being thrown forward I like the interior of the car because it was very roomy and I could fit many people in there This car is affected by the wind a lot though Perhaps not not_as not_much not_as not_a not_smaller not_car but more than I would like a car of that size to My rear view mirror has fallen off about four times one summer but that was the only summer that it did that That is an easy fix though My cup holder would stick a lot also From experience I would have to say that this car is not not_worth not_the not_money not_you not_would not_spend not_on not_it not_This not_was not_my not_first not_car and it had eighty thousand miles on it It is a six cylinder 3 0 liter From the start I have had problems with my breaks causing me to have them replaced four times in two years At the time that I got rid of my car the alignment was getting unaligned for no reason I would be driving and it would get worse and worse I know another person who had a 1989 taurus gl and she has had the same problems I heard of a recall for a certain part of the car and went to check it out and I found that there are many parts on recall for this car I do have to say that this car does hold up well in an accident though I hit a car from behind and I was going about 25 m p h and all I really had to replace was the radiator
Neg,The air conditioning still works I have owned a 91 Ford Taurus since 1995 In its favor it still runs after 146 000 miles However nearly everything else does not not_I not_bought not_the not_vehicle not_expecting not_reliability not_good not_performance and decent looks for the price It does have a reasonably roomy interior although we ve experienced major fading and cracking of the hard components such as the dash The Taurus provides good acceleration when the transmission is working and reasonably good steering although it doesnt corner very tightly In that time I have sunk nearly 5000 worth of repairs into it including a transmission replacement numerous brake jobs and uncounted miscellaneous electrical and alignment based repairs Buy the vehicle only if you can do your own repairs and dont not_mind not_lots not_of not_grease not_monkey not_time if you dont not_know not_your not_way not_around not_a not_Chilton not_manual not_forget not_this not_car The looks are mostly intact although the paint is scaling and flaking in spots particularly on the top of the vehicle I never got the reliability and performance has been decidedly spotty The major problem with the vehicle Anything that can fall part frequently and expensively does Currently the gas gauge doesnt work and whenever the weather is cold the speedometer doesnt either Consumer Reports lists the 91 Ford Taurus as a car to avoid and I must agree
Neg,We bought a 91 Taurus almost 2 years ago Then the famous CHECK ENGINE light intermittently throughout the drive The first sign of problems to come was the CV joints It seemed to be in fairly good shape and drove well for a short time After they were replaced the brakes squealed BADLY even after the pads and shoes were replaced But saving the best for last the notorious TRANSMISSION BUG has to be the best icon for the 91 Taurus they should condsider changing their logo No downshifting on highway exits no upshifting when entering a busy street spontaneous shifting up AND down while going down the street Or MY personal favourite the NO shifting No up down sideways just no gear at all just a loud screaming transmission then a sudden neck cracking lurch into 2nd gear and on a related note I have NO speedometer now thanks to the transmission Currently relying on a radar detector to avoid tickets lol But to be fair I will say that when I am not not_getting not_whip not_lash not_from not_the not_jerky not_transmission not_which not_I not_can not_find not_NO not_mech not_to not_work not_on not_for not_less not_than not_twice not_what not_I not_paid not_for not_the not_car not_due not_to not_the not_upgrades not_ford not_made not_to not_the not_91 not_models not_transmissions not_or not_wetting not_myself not_from not_the not_ever not_worsening not_loose not_steering not_it not_IS not_a not_comfortable not_ride not_with not_lots not_of not_room not_front not_and not_back not_but not_in not_my not_opinion not_a not_10 not_speed not_bicycle not_would not_be not_a not_better not_deal
Neg,I just got rid of this vehicle The air conditioner went bad around 60 K miles and never really worked again after several repairs This poor condition after 127 000 miles was only the result of regular wear and tear and more than 5000 invested in repairs over the course of 5 years If you are a regular mechanic and think you can get a bargain on this vehicle then go for it but otherwise I would recommend steering clear The transmission started failing before 100 K and finally went out around 110 K miles I had the transmission replaced and it began to fail only 15 K miles later My family bought it used in 1995 and it was my first car that I had driven from the moment I learned to drive until just a few weeks ago During the time that I owned the vehicle the rotor cracked causing the wheel to fall off luckily while moving slowly The water pump also went out and the brakes began to stick Even though only the first rust spots were beginning to form on the vehicle it felt as though it was only a matter of days before something else would go wrong so I traded it in for a 2000 Pontiac Sunfire Unfortunately the dealer would only offer 450 for the trade in value because of its poor condition
Neg,It had great features It was a bad apple The interior was very clean also We saw this beautiful burgandy Taurus It in a dark burgandy suede feeling like material So we figured that maybe it was a pretty good car The dealership said that it had been a rental car in Hawaii My husband and I were needing a bigger car after our 2nd child was born In fact I really only drove it around town for errands etc When we sold it to her we had took the miles up to 23 000 It had only 17 000 miles on it It had power windows doors steering airbag etc My sister wanted to buy it from us thinking that we were making up the weird things in our heads We hesitantly sold it to her thinking that if something went wrong she knew where we lived etc They also ended up having to replace the struts on it Now I know that we werent hard on the car We wanted something larger than our civic so that we had room to grow and wouldnt not_have not_to not_buy not_another not_car not_for not_awhile If you are smart you will stay away from this year of Taurus I dont not_know not_about not_the not_other not_years but my husband and I have not not_had not_any not_desire not_to not_own not_another not_one She hadnt owned the car even two years when she got stranded 200 miles from home because the transmission went out on it A year or so later the engine went out on it They ended up selling the car We wanted it really bad It was a closeout and they were offering a pretty good deal on it We ended up buying it and brought it home After about a month or so the air conditioner went out on it My husband took it back to the auto store that we bought it from and they hesitantly fixed it There were a few other weird things that went wrong with it We decided to sell it because we both thought that it would die on us any minute
Neg,We did manage to correct that problem It is the perfect size and shape for me We paid 10 000 for a nicely loaded car The body of this car has held up well Wow Out of curiosity I started reading the Taurus reviews It had all the options I could have wanted We also have a 93 Taurus that I hate Now I feel safe and secure when driving this older car around It has been just as unreliable as the other one has been reliable We did have to replace the knobs recently that work all the heating and air conditioning settings There is 160 000 miles on the Taurus I love and a lot less on the other car They only confirmed my suspicions I think the Taurus tends to be a lot like a cocker spaniel We are very bad at keeping it washed and waxed and it is just now starting to show some rust It has always been very reliable I never had any problem with getting stuck anywhere due to a car problem If I dont not_get not_another not_Taurus not_I not_plan not_to not_try not_to not_find not_a not_car not_as not_similiar not_as not_I not_can not_to not_the not_Taurus We are also very bad at managing to get the oil changes on time Still the engine is doing fine Nothing has really broken down on this car They just seemed to wear out and fall off a lot The only really annoying thing we had a problem with is that the trunk had a tendency to pop open while you were driving down the highway As good as this car has been I am starting to get a little worried I do know a lot of people that have had nothing but trouble with the Taurus and we are some of those people This is absolutely the most comfortable car I have ever driven I am just under 5 tall and still I need not not_worry not_about not_sitting not_on not_a not_pillow not_or not_anything not_stupid not_like not_that not_I not_have not_had not_that not_problem not_with not_other not_cars not_in not_the not_past My favorite options being the automatic windows and seats have continued to work well needing no repairs as of yet Now that this car is almost 11 years old I couldnt really complain too much if things started to go although I hope it continues to hold up for awhile It took 3 tries to get an alternator that would work for more than a day or two but that can happen with any car After that it was clear sailing all the way I really cant not_say not_too not_much not_bad not_about not_this not_car not_at not_all not_I not_bought not_this not_91 not_Taurus not_in not_95 not_from not_a not_dealer The automatic seats adjust all over the place making it easy to get a comfortable fit Also they are very easy to adjust even while driving I like this because if you start to feel cramped tired and uncomfortable you can just move a button or two and the change of position eases the discomfort right away If you know cockers you will find they come in good and bad It seems they have two very different temperments Laid back and affectionate would be type one Nasty and very apt to bite is the second type With the Taurus you have the dependable joy to drive car and also the Found on Road Dead type My 91 Taurus couldnt have been a better car for me We did have a period of unreliability due to a bad alternator It really shouldnt not_be not_in not_the not_condition not_it not_seems not_to not_be not_in not_I not_have not_heard not_that not_they not_tend not_to not_die not_about not_the not_time not_you not_hit not_the not_100 not_000 not_mark not_I not_do not_know not_that not_several not_that not_have not_done not_that not_exact not_thing not_I not_am not_beginning not_to not_get not_nervous not_about not_driving not_it not_because not_of not_the not_record not_of not_some not_of not_the not_others not_I not_want not_to not_buy not_a not_new not_car not_soon not_or not_a not_new not_for not_me not_but not_slightly not_used not_car not_I not_would not_love not_to not_have not_another not_Taurus not_but not_because not_I not_keep not_hearing not_bad not_stories not_about not_the not_Taurus not_owned not_by not_others not_I not_am not_leary not_of not_doing not_this not_I not_must not_make not_up not_my not_mind not_soon
Neg,The vehicle has 220 horsepower and it is a stick shift It is unreliable and will put you in the poor house by the amount of the repairs cost In the two years I owned the car my father spent out over 7000 fixing the problems In the two years that I drove the vehicle it has been repaired at least once a month The repairs alone would cost more than 1000 and the mechanic would take up to a month to fix the problems You might be asking why I named my opinion Turbo Pinto Well as a high school graduation gift my father gave me his old 1991 Ford Taurus SHO The car was purchased brand new in 1991 with every option you can think of The color on the outside was white and the interior was black leather At this time I was just starting college and needed a reliable car to drive my Taurus did not not_do not_its not_job not_Problems not_I not_encountered not_the not_last not_time not_I not_drove not_the not_car not_were not_the not_temperature not_of not_the not_car not_was not_always not_hot not_due not_to not_the not_coolant not_holder not_always not_leaking not_electrical not_system not_would not_malfunction not_during not_warm not_temperature not_days not_the not_brakes not_sweaked not_profusly not_my not_favorite not_one not_the not_air not_conditioning not_system not_would not_only not_work not_for not_ten not_minutes not_and not_last not_but not_not not_least not_the not_factory not_stereo not_broke not_I not_DO not_NOT not_recommend not_buying not_this not_car not_it not_is not_a not_complete not_lemon not_My not_Taurus not_deserves not_the not_title not_of not_TURBO not_PINTO
Neg,The check engine light is always coming on and it stalls out on you We have put so much money in this car I am afraid to buy another ford taurus thinking that it will have the same problem after a few years We bought a Ford Taurus a few years ago it was a 91 We bought it because it fit our family Well when we bought it we had to replace the transmission and the paint on the hood was chipped Now it is 2000 and it is already needing another transmission and the paint is really chipped off of the hood
Neg,I bought this car used from a dealer for 500 I thought that was an excellent price since the car was in perfect condition I mean not not_a not_dent not_scratch not_spot not_on not_the not_interior not_nothing The guy said it needed a new head gasket so I thought with a mechanically inclined husband that was great Well we bought a gasket kit for 124 and did the job and sure enough the gasket was split Well how exciting the car is back together and ready to run for the first time Wont start Needs a new converter but that was OK because sometimes that could happen when you blow a gasket because of the antifreeze getting in there Well 350 there ready to run Sounds little rough and doesnt shift properly Had to fix transmission gears broken By doing that job we found broken rear motor mount axles cv joints coolant lines 1672 completes this job Once again ready to roll remind you I havent yet got to drive the car Runs rough and oil light comes on at idle I need new bearrings and a crank shaft Currently I have only driven the car for little test rides after each job and now the car is sitting for sale in front of my house after 2646 and the cost of insurance and registration etc I refuse to do the job because at this I feel that if I do there will only be another problem lurking All these problems and the car just now hit 100 000 I will never as long as I live own a FORD car
Neg,Thank you that is all MAC My little sister owns a 1991 Ford Taurus and ive got to admit it really sucks The suspension is too rough the transmission shifts too hard and the over all quality of the interior is just well tacky Now im not not_trying not_to not_cut not_down not_Ford not_Motor not_Company not_in not_any not_way not_I not_just not_think not_they not_can not_build not_a not_better not_car This particular Taurus has a 3 4 L V6 that barely has a downshift and couldnt go fast if your life depended on it and im talking about when it was brand new Now its even worse While driving her car I realized that it is just a pile of scrap metal on wheels I dont not_know not_what not_the not_newer not_model not_Ford not_Taurus not_handles not_like not_but not_this not_one not_cant not_and not_wont not_perform not_I not_believe not_I not_have not_told not_you not_enough not_of not_about not_the not_piece not_of not_mobile not_junk not_so not_I not_ll not_quit not_taking not_up not_your not_time Not only is it too plain but it reminds me of something you would see in a 1970 Volkswagon Van Now I have to admit the stereo and sound system are pretty good because I installed them myself so I know I asked her if I could take it around town for a little while and see what it sounds like and see if I can get anyone to look and try to see where the music is coming from People did look well thats beside the point
Neg,No im not not_a not_princess The sparks went at 30 K If I could do it again The battery has never really taken to winter However as a big person this is absolutely the most uncomfortable car in the world Id have taken another Escort No offense Mom and Dad I cant not_wait not_to not_trade not_up Who did they design this for As for reliability its had its share of woes So did the tires Its had its share of buzzes and whirs all requiring 400 600 treatments from my handy neighborhood mechanic I put a new exhaust system on it at 35 K It requires amazing contortions to get in and out and the wheel is right in my chest when I drive im only 5 5 and even with the seat back my legs overshoot the pedals But a few years ago my parents decided to buy me a new car Since they were trading in my Escort they wanted to stick with a Ford product and I was ready to go for something a little bigger with 4 doors A few days later my brother appeared with a nifty new green 93 Tempo GL 4 doors with almost all the bells and whistles It was mine and then I discovered the fit Even though the Tempo is bigger than the Escort theres less interior room I felt stuffed like a sausage Still it was new it was a gift and gosh it had AC and power locks and an airbag ive had it 7 years now its strictly a train and back car so ive only got 44 K miles on it In other words its likely to last forever and it meets my needs
Neg,Its engine works just fine and I have taken it to several road trips The only thing that kind of makes me happy about owning this car is that it never had any major breakdown If you get annoyed by little things then I guess you shouldnt not_buy not_this not_car not_because not_they not_break not_all not_the not_time If you want to get something that will take you from the point A to the point than its OK I bought a 93 Ford Tempo 3 years ago for 3 000 Its A C didnt not_work and I havent tried to repair it When I bought it it had 54 000 and now it has a little bit over 90 000 So far the biggest problem with it was the electrics Cruise control would work but if I went over a bump it would stop working Windows go down and up at their will I hate the brake I have to put a lot of energy into stepping on it to reach the stopping point I dont not_think not_that not_its not_very not_stabile
Neg,But the car requires maintenance every months causing minor problems here and there We have bought this car in Feb 2001 and kept for 9 months Because the car was really cheap the car has been working satisfactorily This car has been teaching us how to maintain the car because it breaks down very often The car has 91 000 miles and we had to fix so far as follows the cost of labor includes starter 227 front end alternator 241 a hole in radiator 86 new radiator 125 a c not not_fixed not_yet not_door not_lining not_tipping not_dont not_bother not_fixing not_them
Neg,The tie rod design is very poor and they need to be replaced about every 30 000 miles I had to put three alternators in it already and the front end has given me lots of problems I own a 1993 Ford Tempo Ever since I bought it I have had to do nothing but put money into it The car was great for the first year or so and after that ive been spending about 1000 a year in repairs This has been a very costly vehicle to own and I will never buy a Ford again ive had nothing but problems with mine and havent heard anything good from anyone else about Fords Unfortunately I cant not_afford not_to not_buy not_another not_car not_for not_a not_few not_years not_so not_I not_am not_stuck not_with not_this not_lemon not_for not_awhile not_if not_I not_dont not_go not_broke not_first
Neg,You sit high The eight is a 695 option They could look nicer though The extra gear is between first and the former second So why dont SUVs simply have independent rear suspensions The dash is quite low providing excellent visibility forward So why did I have high expectations for the new Explorer The fairly small cushion with a rounded front edge just looks econocar ish The first one was thrown together in a hurry on a tight budget Most people probably wont even notice that the styling has changed It was based on a very dated Ranger chassis designed in the early 80s The rear seat raises even more questions than that low header high seat in front The latter replaces the venerable 302 which saw its final duty in the Explorer Things started to go wrong as soon as I hopped into the drivers seat This is great for loading cargo Whats more the solid beam transmits anything that happens to one wheel to the other wheel In the powertrain department the 210 horse OHC six is largely carried over while a 240 horse eight is new The other IRS independent rear suspension Truck based SUVs like the Explorer generally have a solid or live rear axle To help absorb so much force the springs and shocks have to be made softer The seat could be lower and still leave the driver well above the top of the dash This is actually more comfortable than you would expect Felt kinda nice having them there Why were my expectations so high for the new Explorer In an acronym IRS No certainly not not_the not_Internal not_Revenue not_Service In the new vehicle theres more room back there enough to fit a very comfortable seat at a very comfortable height The new eight is based on the base engine in the Expedition but has an aluminum block to save weight Are the extra thirty horsepower necessary enough to be worth this much money Read on Styling is not not_among not_the not_major not_changes They provide an average level of back support Nothing to write home about good or bad in terms of comfort No one at the time knew SUVs would turn out to be so hot Now Ford knows Ford did do an excellent job with the cargo area So low that when the headrests are down all the way they press into the upper part of my back This makes it all the more surprising that they blew the most basic safety stuff This means that the wheels are rigidly attached to the end of a solid metal tube that contains the heavy differential in the center This reduces the liftover to a very manageable height But if you want to know why I was so disappointed you ll have to read on Whats new for 2002 This should improve acceleration beyond first gear since RPM will not not_drop not_as not_much not_after not_the not_shift not_keeping not_the not_engine not_in not_its not_powerband The seat was up but only about an inch Even in the lowest position I was sitting too high relative to the windshield header for my personal taste This showed in how it rode and handled Like most SUVs and nearly every American car thirty years ago the Explorer used a body on frame construction Its large usefully shaped well finished and very easy to access While the old eight was paired with a four speed automatic the new one is paired with the five speed that only the OHC six came with before When you hit a bump with such a suspension this entire heavy axle and wheel assembly absorbs the shock without the mediation of any springs or shock absorbers Because so much mass is set in motion it has a tendency to jostle the entire vehicle its a matter of simple physics force equals mass times acceleration At the same time I doubt many people will raise the rear headrests so much most people leave them all the way down for aesthetics and driver visibility The spec sheet touts all of the stuff Ford has done for safety in the new design including all sorts of airbags They look durable enough so I guess cheap really the right word There may be other problems lurking Unfortunately more bad news is not not_far not_away Beginning around fall of 2000 I told people interested in buying a mid sized SUV that they should wait until a totally redesigned Explorer was introduced in January 2001 This is nice but some of the competition namely GM is now doing far more for rear passengers The XLT I drove was about halfway between the base vehicle and the top of the line Limited These problems may even be most noticeable at low speeds over minor to moderate road imperfections On the sparsely populated positive side of the ledger the new Explorer is fairly quiet But you ve most likely already seen that I gave it three stars and a not not_recommended so you ve probably already guessed that I was quite disappointed once I had the opportunity to drive one But it means the second row seat has to fold that much lower to form a flat floor which forces the seatback to be smaller The eight performed only marginally better than the six The Ranger based frame was far too flexible for such a heavy vehicle Combined with soft body mounts between the body and frame used to help the ride this resulted in a vehicle that shimmied and shuddered over even minor road imperfections Why did Ford make the rear seatback so low I suspect it has something to do with the low cargo floor I mentioned earlier Even more than that it knows that the Explorer is the best selling of the all that this makes a huge amount of money for the corporation and that the Japanese are finally waking up and fielding some top notch SUVs Put all of this together and Ford knew that its continued financial success depended on redesigning the Explorer so that it was the best Id like to maintain the suspense as to whether or not not_the not_new not_Explorer met my expectations So this seat seems unsafe to me given how most people will configure it And hard for adults to nap in on trips A final safety detail the center belt is lap only With the new Explorer Ford has addressed this problem by having some of the door open with the glass so that it is like a door within a door The main quality lapse I noticed in the vehicle I drove was a minor squeak in the dash around the instruments The sole bright spot in the handling is a very tight turning circle for such a large vehicle I wish my compact car turned this sharply At any rate the six in the GM SUVs performs much better than Fords eight So all else being equal a vehicle with a live rear axle usually handles and rides significantly worse than one with an independent suspension on all but perfectly smooth roads With an independent suspension only the mass of a single wheel tire brake assembly is upset when one wheel hits a bump It had your basic amenities such as power drivers seat height adjuster power windows cruise etc but no more Nothing you wont find in your typical Taurus from Hertz This is a fairly high shift point for regular driving A bit more throttle and the tranny shifts at 5000 you get the idea This is my hypothesis at least I didnt not_fold not_the not_seat not_down not_so not_I not_havent not_tested not_it not_Ford not_does not_provide not_two not_levels not_of not_vents not_for not_rear not_passengers not_with not_a not_switch not_to not_select not_between not_them This engine should not not_have not_to not_work not_this not_hard not_I not_have not_no not_idea not_why not_it not_does First theres that low floor so you dont not_have not_to not_lift not_stuff not_as not_high not_as not_you not_do not_with not_other not_truck not_based not_SUVs not_to not_load not_it not_Then not_there not_is not_the not_matter not_of not_the not_liftglass The steering is fairly decent for an SUV its only a bit on the light side for my tastes but theres just no joy to be had here IRS or no this truck remains a sloppy handler But the competition is not not_staying not_still not_so not_mediocre just isnt not_going not_to not_cut not_it not_much not_longer It lacked the torquey feel engines of this size usually have As with the six even half throttle resulted in 4 000 5 000 RPM shifts Once again a test drive surprised me this time in a good way For details check out my review of the GMC Envoy This fact was highlighted by my second test drive of the day GM has also just introduced totally redesigned versions of its mid sized SUVs So how well did the impressive spec sheet translate to the real world Not well at all I was sorely disappointed Even in moderate turns I didnt not_attempt not_any not_aggressive not_maneuvers not_the not_new not_Explorer not_leans not_heavily and plows Heavy understeer But it always seems like the engine is working quite hard if not not_quite straining In regular driving using about 1 3 throttle to accelerate the transmission shifted at about 4000 RPM But all of this shimmying and shuddering makes the new Explorer feel far less solid than the stats on the new body and frame suggest it should be These sensations say work truck not not_family not_vehicle not_and not_definitely not_not not_luxury The inclusion of an independent rear suspension is especially impressive Unfortunately while the size and utility of the cargo area is exceptional the new Explorer surprisingly falls short in many other areas In contrast to the smaller Escape road noise is especially low I had to strain to hear the tires which for the record were Michelins Wind noise is moderate even at highway speeds But they look durable like materials designed for heavy duty commercial use do This interior looks like it was designed for a work truck not not_one often used as a family vehicle not not_to not_mention not_one bought more and more as a luxury vehicle It ended up being delayed a couple of months but in March it finally arrived I promptly took one for a test drive and posted the following review on March 15 At the time there was no 2002 listing When a 2002 listing appeared I reposted my review to its current location ive never cared for the Explorer in the past Theres no IRS theres no available third row seat at least not not_yet and GM has fallen short so often in the past that I didnt not_expect not_nearly not_as not_much not_from not_these not_new not_vehicles The problem is that in this position the headrest provides zero whiplash protection I couldnt raise the headrest because the seat had the plastic on it still and I didnt not_want not_to not_be not_the not_one not_to not_remove not_it not_I not_assume not_you not_can not_raise not_it not_about not_a not_foot not_as not_crazy not_as not_that not_sounds not_because not_otherwise not_the not_rear not_seat not_would not_be not_unsafe not_for not_tall not_people The launch of the new vehicle was delayed about six weeks to fix lingering quality issues Overall I suspect quality will be about the same as with the old Explorer which is to say about average maybe a touch below average Take all of this together and you might understand why I suddenly had such high expectations for the new Explorer when I learned that Ford was going with an independent rear suspension Because an IRS is so much more expensive I took this as a sign that Ford was doing whatever it takes to make the new Explorer have excellent on road ride and handling It is nice to be able to open the rear glass without opening the entire tailgate if all you have to do is throw in a shopping bag or two The problem is that SUVs tend to be so high off the ground that its not not_always not_easy not_to not_throw not_something not_in not_through not_the not_glass The Mercurys two tone leather made for a more luxurious interior but parts such as the console detracted from the ambiance I did not not_do not_any not_off not_road not_driving not_Given not_the not_on not_road not_experience not_I not_do not_not not_expect not_this not_is not_a not_good not_vehicle not_for not_serious not_off not_road not_driving At a price of 31 265 perhaps this is all I should expect After all if I want more stuff there is always the Eddie Bauer or Limited and whatever options are available on them Except no matter how much you load onto the new Explorer its going to still feel cheap Its a matter of the interior materials As it is the height of the cushion is about average which is to say just a bit too low to adequately support the thighs of someone my height Few vehicles do have a sufficiently high rear seat cushion so I cant not_complain not_too not_much not_about not_this not_in not_the not_Explorer not_I not_can and will complain a lot about the height of the rear seatback Its really low as if it was designed for small children Well live axles are better for the sort of serious off road driving few SUV drivers actually do This is why Jeep uses a live axle in front as well as in back in all of its vehicles until the new Liberty comes out Live axles also tend to be more durable when driven over rough terrain Finally and this is the most important thing for a company like Ford they are very cheap and easy to manufacture Though the new truck is definitely an improvement it seems this trait has been carried over Very sad Worse every bump sends a shudder up through the steering column I like to be able to feel the road through the wheel but at some point road feel becomes kick back Dont get me wrong the ride is generally comfortable The eight will not not_be not_available not_for

not_drove not_a not_Mercury not_Mountaineer not_with not_the not_240 not_horsepower not_V8 not_and not_leather And its not not_just that the springs and shock valving are too soft Handling has not not_simply not_been not_sacrificed not_for not_ride not_quality not_Fairly not_minor not_imperfections not_in not_the not_road not_surface made the entire vehicle quiver I suspect the body on frame construction has something to do with this The old Explorer seemed to have soft body mounts to help the ride with the result that the body would shimmy on the frame over bumps That said the new design has sharper creases than the old lending it a more upscale appearance The Mercury Mountaineer the Explorers twin has more unique styling than in the past with a front end that people are likely to either love or hate Personally I prefer the classic styling of the Ford I admire what they have tried to do with the Mercury the trendy brushed metal thing but dont not_feel not_they not_have not_quite not_pulled not_it not_off not_Accommodations not_and not_amenities not_With not_the not_above not_knowledge not_I not_took not_a not_trip not_to not_the not_Ford not_dealer So while this

comprehensive pricing information is available I will update this part of the review As for Ford Id advise a bunch of quick revisions to the new Explorer Otherwise they can kiss their market

interior reinforces this impression Its a very plain very functional design Like with so many aspects of this vehicle nothing to write home about good or bad Except that its not not_good which if you want good is bad On the road As many faults as I found with the new Explorer before even driving it they might have been forgotten if the vehicle delivered in the ride and handling department After all thats what I was really looking forward to trying out in the first place The suspension is too soft the handling too clumsy and the vehicle is just too big for that sort of thing Of course few people use Explorers this way For light duty SUV stuff like driving on snow or unpaved roads it should be adequate Last words Ford has a lot at stake with the new Explorer From the spec sheet it appears they went all out to guarantee that the Explorer will continue to be the best selling SUV The six is just barely up to moving this much vehicle Thankfully Ford added a gear between first and what used to be second a few years ago so that once the transmission does shift you remain in the engines powerband I never felt like the engine was letting me down I could accelerate as quickly as Id want to in regular driving but the engine makes a lot of noise while going about its work Its not not_an not_entirely not_unpleasant not_sound not_ive not_certainly not_heard not_nastier not_sounds not_coming not_from not_engines This is after all the same company that only recently has made an IRS available on the Mustang and even then only with the top of the line Cobra Information that the all new frame would be far stiffer than the old one provided further evidence that this might be Fords goal I have now learned that Ford also had other benefits in mind Namely they wanted to open up space in the rear for a new feature an optional third row seat Going with an IRS made this seat possible even though the new vehicle is just a tad larger on the outside than the old one Sure it is a cramped seat much like those in the Acura MDX and Dodge Durango but many people want a third seat for kids and for them it should do just fine Going with an IRS also allowed for the amount of cargo room to be substantially increased and for the cargo floor to be significantly lower Anyone who has had to put a lot of stuff into an SUV will probably realize the significance of that last improvement Some other improvements are worth mentioning
Neg,There is no leg room It is not not_seating not_for not_adults The height clearance inside the cabin is lower There was a problem finding stashing places That is where all the hidden space has come from There is a definite improvement in the stashing capability in the redesigned console That is if the members of the car pool are kids The caddy in the center console has a crazy useless configuration in my 2000 Ford Explorer Ford Explorer has taken a lot of heat in the media of late The ride is great and I am sure the reliablity is as good The visibility out the front window is also affected if you are an average sized person By the way there are also extra seats in the back Great for car pooling They have a car like riding truck I had no complaints with the old ride With narrower smaller seats all those stashing places are useless I cannot not_fit not_comfortably not_inside not_with not_all not_my not_stuff But then the seat is smaller Since 2000 my butt has gotten bigger and the Ford Explorer seats have gotten smaller He hits his head and the man is only over six foot not not_seven foot The Explorer is wider on the outside but not not_on not_the not_inside It is a great product and has been the mainstay of the Ford line for a few years now From time to time Ford has tried some improvements With the media after them relative to roll overs and Firestone tires I guess this was the time to really give Explorer a new look But now my mother in law will not not_have not_to not_be not_hosted not_up not_into not_the not_passenger not_seat not_The not_Explorer not_is not_closer not_to not_the not_ground BUT my husband cannot not_ride not_in not_the not_front not_seat You have to climb in like a amusement park ride to get back there I would never ask an adult to do so especially if I was picking the crew up at the airport Where do you put the maps and the pocketbook and the wrench and those little items most of us carry around with us When I got in for a test drive the salesman pointed to the door and said here is the spot for your water bottle Well my fifty something neighbor down the street never leaves home without her bottle I must be the camel in the neighborhood I was not not_impressed not_Unfortunately I discovered that little curve meant I had less leg room
Neg,The kids havent complained though This van was made at the Oakville Ontario plant The front suspension makes squeaking and grunting noises at low speeds The back seats are the full width ones and are very heavy This van has the 3 8 engine and has adequate power This is compared to previous Windstars not not_to not_other not_makes not_and not_models In previous years the wheels were the cast aluminum one piece no wheelcover wheels and they were fine The pedal pressure is just right and the van seems to slow and stop just fine Noise generally a pretty quiet vehicle This one has both front doors and the right sliding door and the rear hatch door all squeaking in unison as I drive down the road I get a new Windstar LX as a company vehicle every year and I am disappointed by the lack of quality in this 2002 model The front seats are great ive never used the back seats one of them is in my garage unused so I cant not_attest not_to not_their not_comfort The engine makes quite a bit of noise at full bore as compared to other vehicles but it is noticeably quieter than the 1999 model I had several years ago Interior Handling this is a minivan and it handles like one would expect it to At high speeds over 60 it doesnt like to go straight without constant steering corrections This is a minivan not not_an not_expensive not_sports not_car not_With not_that not_in not_mind not_here not_are not_my not_observations not_Ride not_smooth not_and not_comfortable not_except not_for not_the not_out not_of not_round not_wheels not_and not_tires not_on not_this not_particular not_van not_making not_it not_vibrate not_at not_highway not_speeds Two wheels are out of round which causes vibrations at highway speeds making everything that isnt not_adjusted not_properly not_shake not_and not_squeak not_I not_can not_see not_that not_the not_rear not_hatch not_door not_and not_the not_right not_sliding not_door not_are not_not not_adjusted not_properly not_and not_do not_not not_close not_tightly not_against not_the not_weatherstrip At really high speeds over 85 it can be tiring to drive as you are trying even harder to keep it in your lane Maybe this is how all minivans are I can only compare it to our Town Car which drives fine at ultralegal speeds Acceleration quite good This is probably not not_a not_design not_flaw but an assembly goof I would accept these flaws from a 10 year old vehicle with lots of miles on it but from a new vehicle None of my previous Windstars were this poorly assembled BTW this is the first Windstar ive had with the stamped el cheapo wheels the kind that need full wheelcovers on them The 2002 model doesnt seem to blast from 0 60 like the 2001 did Maybe they changed the gear ratios Its still pretty good though Transmission not not_bad not_Shifts not_smoothly not_and not_usually not_picks not_the not_right not_gear not_for not_the not_conditions not_Much not_better not_than not_some not_other not_Fords not_I not_have not_driven not_although not_not not_as not_good not_as not_GMs not_I not_have not_driven not_Brakes not_seem not_fine not_to not_me One person can remove and install them if you want a backache so I always get someone to help me move the seats I think other companies have done a better job at designing the seating on their vehicles Reliability so far so good Hasnt broken down yet In previous years I have not not_had not_to not_do not_any not_repairs not_to not_my not_Windstars not_just not_normal not_scheduled not_maintenance not_Quality not_WHAT not_HAPPENED
Neg,The interior is equally as boring except maybe for the CD player The rear seats are bench style and not not_bucket not_style as was in my Chevy Venture This makes it difficult to get in and out even for the smallest person The ride is not not_bad but the stereotype of driving a boat is in full force here Do yourself a favor and shop around I guarantee you ll find a better selection at a different dealer The nose is long the body is a box and there are no accent lines to spruce it up The steering column seems to be a little off center in relation to the drivers seat due to the dash board design If pushed the engine is loud and sounds like its going to explode as it sucks down the 20 gallon gas tank in a matter of 350 miles The space in the rear behind the last bench seat is non existent im not not_sure why it even exists actually Should have eliminated the space and backed the seats up a little bit for more leg room The transmission is a little choppy for a new vehicle Cant imagine what it will be like at 50 000 miles Ford was never known for their transmissions in the first place When removing the seats you have to take the whole bench out instead of simply one seat which is a headache because of the weight I doubt that a mother of three could attempt such a feat I recently received a new 2002 Ford Windstar as a company vehicle I have to say that this was an extremely bad choice First off the body styling is very boring compared to the rest of the mini vans on the market The only pro I can see only applies to myself and that is that it is a free vehicle for me Unfortunately to all of you you ll have to shell out 29 grand for this beauty
Neg,My wife leased a 1999 Ford explorer January 1999 This is our first Ford vehicle and quite possibly our last It has been a nightmare ever since First problem was with the transmission In the early day Fords were ok but now the quality has suffered It went back to the shop a total of three times before they figured that the transmission was defective It started leaking 1 month after we got it They decided a new seal was in order Then came the recalls one for the cruise control then the front hood latch then for a defective windshield washer which would come on intermittently To this day we are still having problems with it Now the airbag light stays on and the rear windshield washer refuses to work we had another problem with the check engine light
Neg,I bought my 1999 Ford Explorer in April of 1999 factory ordered Since then I have had approx 15 recalls Next time I think I ll buy a Mercedes Maybe its the dealer to blame but all those recalls I say something was made wrong It has plenty of space in the back for traveling Safety rods that run across the back space I use the rod to secure my groceries Air conditioning a cassette radio I asked for a CD player and never received one I also asked for running boards didnt not_receive not_them not_Gold not_trim not_got not_Black not_trim not_instead not_im not_finished not_experimenting not_with not_SUVs That is annoying when I have to keep taking it back to the dealer to have something fixed I have put 16 000 miles on it and have had it in the dealer shop six times for repairs from fixing a window to the windshield washer and wipers not not_working not_I not_had not_to not_get not_new not_tires not_because not_of not_the not_Firestone not_suit When I went to change the new tires I had to pay for it up front which was more than 300 00 I had to borrow I was reimbursed within ninety days Cutting corners has about given me a heart attack on several occasions im not not_the not_best not_driver but the potential for my Explorer to flip over on a tight corner is high im not not_totally against my Ford Explorer its roomy comfortable seats five people legally
Neg,It wound up the cylinoid bracket was a factory default This incident left me with nothing good to say about ford My first stop for car shopping was Toyota due to my previous experience for reliability After reading all the positive epinions of Explorer owners looks like I ended up with a LEMON After one week 3 different ford dealerships amp more than eighty percent for a down payment I should ve taken this as a sign Once I finally purchased my 1999 Ford Explorer XLT The parts were still not not_in not_amp not_Ford not_then not_had not_to not_place not_me not_in not_one not_of not_their not_rentals not_A not_ford not_Taurus not_OK not_I not_should not_say not_thank not_you not_they not_gave not_me not_something not_new The gentlemen in the service dept who kept in touch with me regarding my car stated that I caused some problems for them Oh did I mention that particular Service Mgr was no longer at that dealership The mini van was too mommish amp the SUV ceiling seem low floor board high I then went to Ford because I liked the look of their SUV enough room for 2 young kids amp all the consumer magazines gave it overall good ratings The parts had to be ordered amp should be in within a couple of days I was covered for car rental for 5 days but it didnt not_pay not_for not_the not_insurance not_Week not_one not_goes not_by not_amp not_no not_call not_from not_the not_service not_dept not_I not_had not_to not_contact not_them not_because not_the not_rental not_was not_only not_covered not_for not_7 not_days Next time i ll go with what I know Toyota I wouldnt not_recommend not_my not_worse not_enemy not_to not_purchase not_a not_ford ive only owned 3 brand new cars and this was the first to give me problems within my first 100 000 miles Usually they fall apart after the warranty has expired or you ve paid it off I really loved it I had the few options that were important to me the fleet representative was very nice the finance was within budget amp the insurance didnt not_dent not_my not_pocket not_Well not_I not_was not_into not_month not_5 not_8000 not_miles not_of not_owning not_this not_vehicle not_when not_I not_notice not_the not_transmission not_starting not_to not_slip not_I not_took not_the not_car not_to not_the not_dealer not_for not_a not_recall not_issue not_amp not_mention not_the not_trany not_slips not_of not_course not_the not_repair not_gentleman not_thought not_I not_didnt not_know not_what not_I not_was not_talking not_about If they had told me after week one my car would ve been in the repair shop for a month I would ve known what to expect temporary insurance change so I could feel safer about driving their vehicle if nothing else Ford did cover my rental expenses and my car seems to run OK but I plan on trading it in before the extended warranty runs out or I pay it off I dont want to end up like BeccaM Now I know why I havent owned an american car within the last 20 years The rental agreement was for 5 a day 1200 max coverage Everyone knows 1500 probably wouldnt not_cover not_a not_dented not_bumper not_After not_numerous not_phone not_calls not_to not_the not_service not_dept not_claiming not_the not_parts not_hadnt not_arrive not_yet not_I not_call not_their not_service not_mgr not_who not_never not_returned not_any not_of not_my not_calls not_so not_I not_had not_to not_go not_a not_step not_further not_I not_then not_mailed not_a not_certified not_letter not_to not_ford not_informing not_them not_of not_this not_issue not_amp not_letting not_them not_know not_I not_was not_aware not_of not_the not_lemon not_law not_I not_also not_sent not_written not_notifications not_to not_the not_California not_Consumer not_affairs not_cartalk not_com not_better not_business not_bureau not_amp not_other not_consumer not_advocates not_such not_as not_those not_we not_see not_on not_TV not_By not_day not_30 not_of not_having not_my not_car not_in not_the not_shop not_amp not_23 not_days not_of not_rental not_on not_a not_ford not_taurus not_the not_service not_dept not_calls not_me not_informing not_me not_my not_car not_is not_ready not_how not_convenient not_day not_31 not_would not_ve not_qualified not_me not_for not_the not_lemon not_law
Neg,One year ago driving by my local ford dealership I noticed a sharp looking SUV And after going through all of this in less than a years time I would NOT recommend the 99 explorer sport to ANYONE Also when I turn on the turn left signal my wipers come on and then go off im no expert when it comes to wiring but is this not not_a not_short not_in not_the not_electrical not_system not_now not_the not_cigarette not_lighter not_does not_not not_work not_there not_are not_many not_other not_small not_things not_about not_the not_explorer not_I not_dont not_like but I guess thats what I get for IMPULSE BUYING So I turned around and took it for a test drive Pleased with the price and the way it looked I traded vehicles I was very pleased with the way it drives for the first week then came rain Having owned two SUVs before this one and had no problems driving during bad weather Well it was a different story for the explorer ITs VERY HARD TO HANDLE ON A WET ROAD And if the wind is blowing hard you might as well pull over Besides driving during bad weather I have been haunted with recall letters I think i have had 4 so far and i am sure there will be more soon Now lets talk about ford quality parts that the explorer is made of 5 months after the impulse buy that I made several parts STOP working first thing to go was the back windshield wiper well it works when it wants to not not_when not_I not_need not_it not_to not_Then not_my not_fog not_lights not_ground not_lights not_work not_when not_its not_warm not_havent not_figured not_that not_one not_out not_yet not_Nor not_has not_the not_dealer not_any not_suggestions
Neg,And the facts will back that up It certainly cant not_call not_itself not_the not_most not_powerful not_the not_best not_looking not_or not_the not_best not_handling The only title the Explorer can lay claim to is the best selling SUV in America It is a step up from the Ranger pickup that its based on but still bouncy In a nation where the Camry outsells any car the best selling SUV title may not not_be not_so not_glamorous Yet it is not not_a not_big not_step not_up not_for not_the not_money not_0 not_60 not_figures not_improve not_by not_only not_3 not_seconds not_and not_quarter not_mile not_times not_by not_2 not_Still not_not not_convinced not_the not_base not_engine not_is not_the not_way not_to not_go not_Consider not_the not_top not_level not_engine That is a lot of body roll a lot of bounce and a generally uncomfortable ride Again the base model shows its true colors with a skidpad reading of 73g opposed to only 70g for the V8 Likewise suspension is nothing revolutionary On the plus side the Explorer is safe given its standard airbags and disc brakes but please stay away from Firestone Wilderness A Ts It is also roomy accommodating 4 people well 4 people who are not not_susceptible not_to not_motion not_sickness not_and not_5 not_people not_for not_short not_hops The base engine in an Explorer is a little 4 0 liter 160 horsepower deal left over from the early Explorer days Coupled to a manual transmission this engine is slow sluggish and a good choice Seem paradoxical Consider this The next level up is 4 0 liter V6 with 50 more horsepower Why shell out more for an 2 valve cylinder V8 that only goes slower than the base and has 14 miles per gallon efficiency note the V8 carries more torque so if you need to haul something e g a boat you might consider it but for hauling kids keep your money Roadholding in an Explorer is characteristic of an SUV It is a 5 0 liter V8 with scoff 2 valves per cylinder Given a whole extra liter of displacement and 2 more cylinders to work with the engine only gains 5 horsepower from the next step down Most surprisingly however 0 60 in a V8 Explorer will take you 9 seconds as opposed to 8 7 in the considerably cheaper base model im almost always a fan of a bigger engine but in this case I say save your money
Neg,The cargo space and room that the Explorer provides is great To get to the back seat is kind of hard It is very easy to adjust the seat and it provides a lot of fine tuning of your seats position For the looks of the car I would definitely recommend the Premium Sports Package Driving the Explorer on a bumpy road is like riding a camel very shaky It is easy to load big stuff into it I have the Comfort Package with the 6 way power drivers seat which is really great if two people of different height use the car I own a 99 new Ford Explorer Sport for about a year I already had 3 warranty repairs and thats a brand new car After 6 weeks the ABS module broke which also caused the odometer and the speedometer to fail It took my dealer 4 visits to figure out that the ABS module was the problem A couple of weeks later one of the rear safety belts broke and last week the motor of the rear end wiper died This has stopped as suddenly as it appeared Maybe I got an especially bad assembled car but it makes one wonder about the quality assurance at Ford The Explorer Sport is a really nice car if two people are riding in the car Then there is still that rattling noise close to the moonroof which no dealer was able to find the cause of Also there were two recalls by Ford After getting that fixed suddenly my wiper come on whenever I turned or gave a turning signal When turning on wet streets the rear end of the car is skidding which doesnt make you feel very safe in it When making longer road trips on a highway it is a very comfortable nice to drive car I still love my Explorer sometimes its a love hate relationship but I would not not_buy not_one not_anymore nor would I recommend it to anyone
Neg,My wife loves the Explorer but she is 5 5 tall im 6 2 and this vehicle is not not_made not_for not_people not_our not_height We had an XLT for 3 years and upgraded to an Eddied Bauer with a sunroof Big mistake for me because I cant not_sit not_straight not_up not_Also not_when not_will not_Ford not_learn not_to not_place not_their not_rearview not_mirror not_higher not_up not_on not_the not_windshield not_I not_think not_they not_are not_the not_only not_manufacturer not_that not_still not_mounts not_the not_mirror not_to not_the not_windshield not_so not_its not_right not_in not_the not_way not_Also not_the not_seats not_do not_not not_have not_ANY not_head not_restraints not_for not_somebody not_over not_6 not_tall not_im not_surprised not_FORD not_has not_not not_gotten not_dinged not_for not_this not_The not_Limited not_version not_has not_this not_option not_but not_this not_is not_not not_the not_standard not_model not_Overall not_my not_wife not_loves not_it not_so not_we not_re not_stuck not_with not_it not_but not_I not_do not_not not_recommend not_it not_to not_a not_person not_with not_above not_average not_height
Neg,So we made a painful decision I loved my 99 Explorer XLT for the first 2 months Take the loss and get another SUV that will really fit our needs There is a lot of outside noise in the Explorer much less than the Expedition Then I realized something Theres not not_as not_much cargo space as the brochures lead you to believe Then we went back and bought the SUV we d originally intended to buy the 99 Expedition My mother and father could not not_ride not_comfortably not_in not_the not_backseat not_during not_a not_visit not_even not_without not_all not_the not_junk not_and not_this not_was not_frustrating not_for not_everyone On the highway we found ourselves turning the radio up higher only to notice that on regular streets we were blasting ourselves The drivers seat is not not_comfortable not_for not_a not_135 not_pound not_woman not_Even not_with not_all not_the not_ergonomic not_gadgets not_adjusted not_the not_pain not_was not_still not_there not_As not_I not_had not_previously not_owned not_a not_compact not_the not_Explorer not_was not_huge not_at not_first If you re a mom like me a lot of stuff gets carted around daily Strollers car seat diaper bag etc Add groceries or plants from the nursery and there is no room for folks We ve owned the Expedition for a month now and LOVE everything about it except the locks that lock automatically when you step on the brake seems pretty cool until you realize how often the passenger hops in and out getting mail checking on baby one last time fetching diaper from back etc and im still working on getting into a parking place on the first try but thats another story There are 3 main reasons why I traded up to the 99 Expedition Eddie Bauer drivers seat comfort cargo space and highway noise I began to realize that my back really was hurting every day and suddenly it dawned on me that my beloved new SUV was the culprit I was driving about 70 miles a day quite a haul I agree but I had never experienced back pains like this after driving
Neg,What attracted us to this vehicle But now we have to ask ourselves We liked it We truly did It does really well getting up to speed in good time Do we have confidence in this cars quality and safety standards As a result im not not_entirely not_confident not_of not_the not_quality not_of not_the not_vehicle In conclusion we had previously considered the 1998 Ford Contour a really good car She tells us that the problem will be fixed free of charge Who doesnt like to feel confident of the way their car handles We purchased our 1998 Ford Contour Sport GL with a 16 valve 4 cylinder engine in October of 1999 My husband pulls over immediately and we haul the kids out of the car in record time No one should have to go through this experience but people have Quite a few people apparently It was nearly new it was in our price range and it was a pretty blue color When my husband relates the tale to the woman at Ford she is very understanding and sympathetic To me it was a good car that handled well had a peppy four cylinder engine and was an economical drive Yes the Ford Contour definitely has a dark side Since we have owned the car there have been 2 recalls It hugs those bends and turns and what that translates to is a solid secure feeling through the car and steering wheel She even goes so far as to tell us that she knows the exact problem they ve seen quite a few This vehicle is definitely above average in this regard and this feature is possibly my number one favorite in the 1998 Contour Next good thing about the 1998 Ford Contour is its acceleration abilities My husband is a diesel mechanic and he said it smelled like burning wiring All of a sudden light gray smoke starts pouring from the glove compartment and dashboard So why hasnt Ford issued a recall to prevent another possibly more serious incident from happening Maybe this is like the Freestone Tire issue there has to be a certain death toll to make results happen In addition all of the literature that we read about the 1998 Contour was very positive Performance handling and fuel economy were highlights of reviews From what we read in the Lemon Aid book the car represented excellent value for money The answer is a resounding No Frankly I have also lost a lot of respect and confidence in The Ford Motor Company as well I cant not_recommend not_this not_vehicle not_to not_others not_in not_all not_conscience not_despite not_our not_previous not_level not_of not_content not_with not_this not_car not_as not_their not_are not_just not_too not_many not_uncertanties not_and not_questions not_surrounding not_the not_safety not_and not_quality not_of not_this not_vehicle We had some diagnostics done earlier this year and the results determined that we get about 13 5 kilometers to 1 liter of gas Things could be very different for the 6 cylinder Contour but if you are looking for an economical vehicle to operate consider this vehicle an option Now onto other matters So well there have been at least three recalls Lets face it recalls are a little inconvenient but stuff gets fixed for free so who cares right Well let me ask you this does the number of recalls reflect the quality of the vehicle overall I think it does We get excellent mileage im certain this is due largely to the fact that this is a 4 cylinder vehicle and given the prices of fuel these days this is definitely a BIG plus Now I have seen reviews that differ on this point but they do not not_say not_if not_they not_are not_the not_4 not_cylinder not_vehicle not_or not_the not_6 not_cylinder What else is looming in the future Will be get the next recall notice or will we be in an accident that leads to the next recall Which leads me to my big issue with the Ford Contour and with Ford itself Last Saturday morning as we were zipping along the highway my husband and I immediately noticed a very strong burning smell My husband then opens the passenger door pulls down the dash panel and rips out the offending article A plastic three way switch and the plugs that had been in it were totally fried resulting in the wiring burning and the plastic socket burnt and melted Fortunately the car is determined still operable and we are able to drive it to our dealership One to adjust the wiring for the airbags to ensure that they actually do go off when needed and one to readjust something with the rear brakes so that they would not not_seize not_in not_an not_emergency not_I not_know not_of not_one not_other not_recall not_to not_do not_with not_the not_headlights but we asked our dealer and apparently that problem was resolved with our vehicle with the previous owner Whether merging on the highway or zipping in and out of traffic in town this car can meet your requirements I feel that this is important to note as several people will shy away from a 4 cylinder as it feels like you re driving a turtle im sure the 6 cylinder just flies by comparison but the 4 cylinder is far from disappointing in this regard Lastly our Contour is absolutely great on gas We ask her If this is such a common problem then why hasnt there been a recall on the car She then told us that usually something else goes before the problem gets as serious as this so when the customer complains of the other problem they fix the entire thing gratis Ford has not not_determined not_the not_need not_for not_a not_recall not_as not_of not_yet not_She not_must not_have not_noticed not_the not_stunned not_look not_on not_our not_faces not_because not_she not_quickly not_said not_But not_no not_one not_should not_have not_went not_through not_something not_like not_this not_Hmmm not_you not_know not_I not_think not_shes not_right However having lived with the car for the past 12 months im not not_so sure that all of the press that the 1998 Contour received was entirely accurate I think this car would have rated as above average within its class but my problem with this vehicle is a lack of confidence in its quality and safety I will address all of the realities of the Contour both good and bad including the numerous recalls and hopefully you will be able to better make your decision I would like to begin with commenting on all of the great things about the 1998 Ford Contour First this thing handles corners like nobodys business
Neg,NO ONE b Introduction The headlights explode The headlights and airbags were recalled The airbags wont go off in a crash Ok that is it for the pros Cons It starts fine when it is warm Its agile too with very little body flex in sharp turns But dont not_worry not_about not_it they wont go off The cruise control will get stuck on resulting in a crash It was nothing but trouble the day it came off the assembly line The throttle cable may fray not not_returning not_to not_idle not_position not_resulting not_in not_a not_crash The rear brakes may lock up and refuse to unlock resulting in a crash The muffler is welded to the frame which will make any replacement expensive This is so the airbags dont not_throw not_anything not_into not_you not_if not_they not_go not_off Ford has to stop trying to make their cars and components look like their emblem On cold mornings sometimes this car refuses to start Battery problem sensor problem I dont not_know The seats are almost comfortable maybe if there was more leg room they d be bearable The designers of the Contour should have looked less at the engine and suspension and more towards comfort interior exterior airbags headlights If you own one of these cars take it to the dealer immediately to get these things repaired If you really want one resale sucks so you ll be able to get a fully loaded 1998 model for 10 000 Thats only the first two years ownership god knows what will happen when Ford quits recalling and they start exploding like Pintos This car has been deeply effected by the Driver Returns On Foot syndrome it is about time Ford removed it from their line up To change the oil you must drain it directly onto an exhaust manifold which of course smells very bad until it all gets cooked off If you really want a family car with some pep get the Impala SS or an SUV with a 4300 Vortec which will keep up just as well and afford better gas mileage If you really want one and are set on getting it no matter how bad it is e mail me and I ll pray for you It seats no one comfortably maybe people who stand five feet tall and below on a recent trip with four adults each and every one complained of being cramped The gas mileage averages at 25 mpg with a 2 5 Liter engine that is obviously ridiculous a friend with a 1997 Sebring has the same size engine and averages 33 mpg on occasion getting as high as 36 Overall The dash board is a joke im used to dash boards where you can put things this one is sloped towards the front seats and anything and everything placed on the dash board will eventually fall What was Ford thinking when they designed a four door car that is capable of 143 mph Obviously when their fastest Sedan is just as fast as their mid sized engine sports car they ve done something wrong The model I speak of was a 1998 which is a refined version I would have hated to see a 1997 or before model of this car they probably have a lower life expectancy than the Mustangs at 2 5 years The radio antenna is motorized which makes for a nice clean look but once that servo goes and you know it will it will be a pain in the butt to replace or it can probably be rigged so that it is always up since the CD player wont even work unless the antenna is up Ovals do not not_make not_for not_good not_climate not_controls nor do they flatter the exterior of this car Road noise is terrible Vibrations at freeway speeds are horrible never mind trying to go faster than that it feels as if the entire car is going to fall apart After an alignment it got a little better but didnt not_go not_completely not_away While the designers of the Mustang should have at least tried to compete with Chevys race oriented cars Pros Ford knows how to do paint it has a beautiful paint job If the headlights didnt not_explode not_they not_put not_out not_adequate not_light and the fog lights work good for daytime I guess for a mid priced sedan this thing moves pretty well 0 60 in 12 seconds
Neg,The problem however is the axles and the tires But we all have our own opinions dont not_we The engine runs great and we have not not_had not_any not_under not_the not_hood not_work not_in not_a not_year Once alignment is gone or anything happens then the cash starts pouring out of the pockets The axles are weak and if not not_aligned not_just not_right not_the not_tires not_where not_extremely not_fast I would have to recommend the car for familys but not not_for not_single not_young not_people not_with not_higher not_chances not_of not_accidents not_etc First of all I have to say that the Ford Contour is a very comfortable vehicle and is a great family car My fiancee and I own a Ford Contour currently and it gets us where we need to go It is a pretty dependable car Something else is that the car looses value quickly Not a good investment if planning on selling it I do believe that the car would run forever if taken care of but once the miles get on it then be prepared to loose some money Believe me I know Well the sum it all up it is very roomy great engine and great gas mileage But on the contrary it depreciates quickly and often requires alot of body work
Neg,It has been doing this since I got it and ive had it for 2 years The reason that I would not not_buy not_this not_car not_again is because they did not not_make not_the not_gas not_tanks not_very not_well The reason I bought the contour is because I wanted a car that was more comfortable and bigger At most gas stations I go to it can take up to 15 minutes to fill the tank because the pump will click off every 20 cents It may be petty but after a while you get agitated while trying to put gas in your car when it is really cold outside There are good points to the car for example it drives pretty good and it is comfortable Overall though I wish I would have gotten a different car Another reason is that it has had 2 safety recalls I just think that if you are going to put that much money into a new car you should not not_have not_to not_deal not_with not_these not_types not_of not_problems I originally bought a new 1998 Ford Contour A month after I got it I was not not_all that thrilled with it Before I bought it I had a Ford Escort in which I had no problems with for four years
Neg,It does have a little more interior space than my Tracer No power anything no tape or cd player etc I MISS MY TRACER But I have had no less than 7 recalls on this car over the last 2 years He had one free day to go to the dealership and trade it for something bigger better faster We paid over 16 000 for this car and the only options we got were air conditioning not not_really an option in Georgia and a rear spoiler My husband was transferred from Indiana to Georgia and decided my poor little Tracer just wouldnt not_make not_it not_on not_the not_racetracks not_they not_call not_highways not_in not_Georgia He came home with a new Contour I have been driving this car for over two years now and I love the fact that it keeps up with the 90 mph traffic on the highways Some of them were for minor problems but some of them were serious enough to have killed me or someone else I also had a problem that wasnt not_even not_on not_the not_recall not_list not_I not_would not_probably not_be not_much not_less not_upset not_about not_this not_had not_we not_not not_paid not_so not_much not_for not_this not_car
Neg,When I rented a Contour I was very pleased with the performance handling and economy of the car In fact I liked it so much that I bought one Now I wish I had bought a Buick In the year and a half I have owned the car there have been at least four recall notices and several service advisories issued I have replaced one wheel bearing at 43 000 miles and my mechanic told me it was never properly packed with grease I had over 175 000 miles on my previous car before I had to replace any wheel bearings I now need to replace another bearing the air conditioning does not not_work not_there not_is not_a not_leak not_in not_a not_right not_front not_body not_seal not_that not_allows not_water not_to not_drip not_on not_the not_floor not_if not_the not_car not_is not_parked not_on not_an not_incline not_during not_a not_rainstorm not_the not_left not_passenger not_door not_hinge not_groans not_and not_squeaks not_the not_seal not_around not_the not_left not_passenger not_door not_allows not_road not_water not_in not_the not_door not_and not_the not_carpet not_does not_not not_fit not_I not_have not_replaced not_one not_front not_speaker not_and not_now not_need not_another not_one not_I not_have not_also not_replaced not_the not_climate not_control not_switch not_but not_it not_still not_malfunctions not_during not_very not_damp not_weather not_when not_I not_need not_the not_defrosters not_most not_Complaints not_to not_Ford not_Motor not_Customer not_Service not_and not_the not_Better not_Business not_Bureau not_have not_resulted not_in not_Well not_your not_warranty not_expired not_so not_too not_bad not_This not_experience not_has not_not not_only not_put not_me not_off not_ever not_buying not_another not_Contour not_but not_possibly not_another not_Ford not_product

Neg,This was not not_a not_leisure not_purchase There is still a problem with the vehicle over heating We needed a second vehicle for her to get to work My wife and I purchased this vehicle when she was promoted to a manager at the restaurant in which she worked They cant not_seem not_to not_find not_anything not_wrong but I have spent plenty on fixing things that arent wrong I personally dont not_feel not_that not_anyone not_should not_buy not_this not_vehicle This one purchase of a Ford has convinced me that I will always buy Toyotas This Ford Contour has about 60 000 miles on it at this point and we are hoping to be rid of it by May 2001 We just cant not_waste not_any not_more not_time not_with not_it not_in not_service not_Compared not_to not_the not_Toyota not_that not_we not_own not_the not_Ford not_is not_driven not_less not_but not_serviced not_more not_at not_a not_higher not_cost not_im not_sorry but if that is the best that Ford can do than no matter whether my mother works for them or not not_Id not_rather not_have not_the not_reliability not_of not_a not_Toyota This vehicle was purchased because it was the closest vehicle that Ford had to a Toyota Corolla we had a 1992 Toyota Corolla that we finally traded in 1999 after having driven it for almost 200 000 miles Compared to what we were used to we like the vehicle for the lighting features like interior lights that activate when the door knobs are pulled from the outside We decided to buy it at a dealer for which my mother works Kenny Ross Ford in Irwin Unfortunately the problems began at the dealership Even though I was immediate family to an employee they tried to sell me the vehicle for almost 4500 over the invoice price Luckily I am an avid online shopper and visited the kelly blue book site before I went to examine the vehicle or I may have assumed that I was getting a nice deal This is convenient in the dark when you are trying to get in and start the car Most everything else about the car is horrible For the size it doesnt get very good gas mileage nothing compared to the Corolla that we had It handles rough I dont not_drive not_it not_frequently but when I do it is my wifes vehicle I seem to have to work harder at controlling it There always seems to be problems with this vehicle I believe it has been recalled for at least 6 items I lost count after that some of the recalls arent minor
Neg,What a hassle There have been more recalls But at least recall repairs are free Ford that is working my last nerve The major problems have been coming out of my pocket I purchased a 1998 Contour in July of 1998 Its been almost two years since I wrote that review That being said I never noticed anything wrong with the car It is great for a small family it fits a car seat and two people in the back seat The roof of the car seems to be slightly higher than the Taurus so my 6 foot 2 husband could sit in the car rather easily In the first year alone I had to take the car back to the Ford dealership that it was purchased from 5 times for recall repairs Sorry we make a bad car every once in awhile luck of the draw and that I should save my 2500 transmission bill as there will probably be another recall on it Other Contour reviews also describe major transmission problems Buy a Kia Ford doesnt stand by their work Id had experience with the Contour due to renting Contours several times in the Us and Europe Its handling and MPG were acceptable to me so when it was time to bit the bullet I paid 14 K new with only a few frills Overall the car has been wonderful its Two months ago I had to replace the tie rod ends and tires 400 and now the transmission has failed and needs to be replaced due to a bad clutch plate Ford dealership mechanics have refused to accept responsibility for this problem by saying Its not not_our not_job not_to not_fix not_Fords not_mistakes and Its a lemon you should get rid of it Ford Corporate says It seems to me that Ford while trying to introduce a car between the soon to be gone Escort and the Taurus has not not_really not_thought not_through not_the not_building not_of not_the not_Contour not_in not_America not_My not_car was built at the Kansas City Ford plant and in spite of their kindly calls to see how I liked the car they still built a car that had 5 RECALLS UPDATE
Neg,The Ford Contour is an acceptable vehicle for the die hard Ford fan that will never consider another brand but the competition is stiff and many better cars are out there for the taking at a comparable price The classification of this car has a lot of competition The Nissan Altima Toyota Corolla Mitsubishi Galant and Saturn make it a crowded field in the similar price range ive driven the all new Nissan Sentra and I think its a hidden treasure in itself I dont not_own not_a not_Ford not_Contour but I rented one for my class reunion in GA last weekend I had the car for only 4 days but I noticed immediately many of the ups and downs of this automobile I currently own 2 cars that have amazing stereo systems in them One has an incredible 7 speaker Nakamichi stereo see my Lexus LS400 review also The Ford Contour had a very basic 4 speakers system that took some getting use to The most obvious problem was the deck wattage output With the volume all the way up sound quality was poor and distortion from any amount of bass was unacceptable ive heard some of the Mach systems in other Fords so I know quality is in reach if a potential buyer needs something better In Georgia it is humid almost year round so a top notch ventilation system is a must The Contour has that down pat The AC worked very well with simple knobs and switches for easy operation and it blew VERY COLD just how I like it Acceleration was a disappointment also Flooring the gas pedal resulted in a lot more noise than movement which was quite a let down for a modern day V6 Handling was a pleasant surprise especially cornering Taking a quick turn wasnt not_at not_all not_a not_frightening not_experience not_like not_in not_some not_cars not_this not_size but the rattles from the interior made me wonder if something might fall off the next time
Neg,I bought my 98 Ford Contour in December of 1999 because I was looking for a reliable car Since that time I have had to take it in for 4 recalls air conditioning stopped working and needed new coil and unit fumes coming into car they havent been able to identify the cause as of yet and they dont not_know not_yet not_why not_the not_car not_is not_beginning not_to not_be not_difficult not_to not_start All of these problems require drop off at a dealership waiting for a ride to work or making other arrangements or getting a rental car due to the work not not_being not_completed not_by not_end not_of not_day not_which not_translates not_into not_missed not_time not_from not_the not_job I have a strong feeling that this is only the beginning of the constant repairs I am going to have with this car I like the design leg room space and comfortable ride of the Ford Contour I dislike car repairs and unreliability I will not not_buy not_another not_Ford not_again nor would I recommend a Ford to a friend
Neg,This vehicle is also very poor in inclimate weather There is nothing about this in the owners manual They found the problem and told me that Ford trucks need to have diagnostics run on Ford equipment to get an accurate reading This vehicle is nice to drive when you arent carrying a load of any kind and when the sun is shining The Ford Ranger is a nice looking truck with comfortable seats and is good for those Sunday drives I bought this vehicle because I read an article in Consumer Reports stating that this was a top quality vehicle and I liked the way it looked and handled at first However my respect for Consumer Reports went down rapidly In rainy icy and snowy conditions this vehicle is like driving a bumper car on the road Any poor road conditions and this vehicle turns like a whale and slides like it is on a Slip and Slide childs toy Basically this is a very poor excuse for a pick up truck This vehicle should only be bought by people in warm weather climates who just need a nice looking cruise around pick up truck and who can afford to make repairs two or three times annually Anyone not not_meeting not_this not_description should stay away from this pick up truck However the Ford Ranger is also a truck with very little power for hauling trailers or carrying any loads such as for moving a desk for the office or a chair for the living room The Ford Ranger is also a truck that is very expensive to fix and requires alot of repairs that need to be done at the dealership where costs are much higher For example I took my vehicle into my mechanic to get a diagnostic done and the diagnostic came up with nothing wrong so I went and got a second opinion and still nothing was wrong but my engine light was still on and I needed to know what was going on Finally I had to take my truck into the dealership and get a diagnostic which cost 159 95 tax
Neg,The sound system in this truck is terrible The only way i can feel like a man is if i can wax someone at a stop light good luck doin it with this truck If you want a truck that can do something other then pull a small trailer with a small load i wouldnt not_recommend not_this not_truck not_at not_all The speakers are for old people who dont not_like not_to not_crank not_it not_Another not_reason not_why not_it not_is not_not not_a not_good not_truck not_is not_because not_of not_the not_sad not_engine not_that not_they not_but not_in not_these not_Come not_on not_a not_V6 not_in not_a not_new not_truck not_is not_not not_needed not_anywhere The Ford Ranger is a decent pickup truck for light loads I bought this truck for moving stuff like a lawn mower and stuff like that I loved this truck because it drove really smoothly and it looked pretty sharp I hated this truck because it has no balls I mean come on a truck is suppose to be manly
Neg,Even the kickdown was smooth The car looks good from the outside The front seats are cramped for such a large car The visibility from the driver 146s seat is very good The heating cooling controls were designed in the dumbest way possible And that 146s where good stuff ends Handling It has nice curves but without boy racer look so it appeals to both older and younger drivers The car handled like a van Slightest turn and the car was rocking and rolling all over the place The Mustang that I drove had 3 8 liter V 6 in it mated to a 4 speed automatic transmission The engine was adequately powerful and didn 146t need to downshift a single time no matter what the road was There is no trunk release lever inside the car so you need to get out of the car and either use the key or button on remote control To be fair Ford took care of most of these stupidities in their Ford Thunderbird convertible but it also costs twice as much as the Mustang I drove On the fifth day of driving the car I finally found the controls for moving the driver seat they were located in the front of the seat power seat in this case and not not_on not_the not_left not_or not_right not_edge not_of not_the not_front not_side not_of not_the not_seat but right behind driver 146s legs In the end I would not not_recommend not_this not_car not_to not_anybody not_as not_after not_short not_period not_of not_time not_the not_feeling not_of not_rip not_off not_will not_set not_in not_as not_you not_start not_thinking not_about not_how not_much not_money not_Ford not_saved not_by not_giving not_the not_Mustang not_interior not_design not_job not_to not_a not_group not_of not_5 not_Detroit not_bums I was on vacation in Florida in 2003 and during that time I had the opportunity to rent the 2002 Ford Mustang Convertible I drove it for more than a week so I think that I was able to see the good and the bad sides of driving this particular car Engine and transmission When you try to open or close the top you have to use the two levers one on each side of the windshield which might be troublesome for a single person In Ford Thunderbird they finally replaced them with single central lever which is foolproof and easy to use It was a silky smooth engine too with deep low satisfying engine note as a matter of fact I mistaken it for V 8 at first but then out of curiosity I opened the hood and saw that it was a V 6 The engine sounded just like V 8 The transmission that the engine is mated to is very smooth also with barely noticeable shifts The door release lever is below driver 146s knee in the most awkward spot right where you would never expect to find it It took me a while to find it the first time when I was trying to get out of the car at night None of the window switches are lit at night same goes to power locks It is as long as many sedans and wider than most of them but it is pretty cramped in the front and I am not not_even not_mentioning not_the not_backseat not_which not_is not_suitable not_mostly not_for not_children not_I not_am not_6 not_feet not_tall not_and not_weigh not_200 not_pounds not_which not_is not_pretty not_average not_Whoever not_was not_in not_charge not_of not_ergonomics not_should not_146ve not_been not_fired not_or not_limited not_to not_designing not_floormats not_for not_Yugos For example if you use air conditioning you can not not_direct not_the not_airflow not_to not_the not_desired not_spot not_because not_there not_is not_no not_separate not_button not_for not_A not_C not_Rather not_there not_is not_separate not_position not_for not_A not_C not_on not_the not_same not_knob not_that not_is not_used not_to not_direct not_the not_airflow not_so not_if not_the not_knob not_is not_in not_A not_C not_position not_it not_cannot not_be not_in not_defog not_position not_I not_could not_not not_use not_the not_A not_C not_for not_longer not_than not_40 not_minutes not_since not_I not_was not_wearing not_flip not_flops not_Florida not_and not_was not_risking not_of not_freezing not_my not_toes not_off While the car has very good ride in the straight line doing a very good job isolating driver from the road bumps if you need to make a turn and I am talking about just a slight turn not not_something not_extreme not_you not_better not_have not_your not_seatbelt not_fastened or you have a good chance of landing somewhere outside of the car Granted it is a convertible so it is not not_as not_stiff as a coupe but still it is considered a sports car afterall so it should at least drive like one Design and Ergonomics
Neg,The color is nice too And the thing really moves However there is no passenger lumbar support If you have a crampy lower back this is nice I dont not_own not_this not_car but I have driven and ridden in it as a passenger The V8 in the GT has a lot of power and great pickup for highway merges On the plus side the car has a nice sound system and it looks cool to drive around in The car has good leg room as I am 6 2 and do not not_feel not_cramped not_especially not_in not_the not_passenger not_seat One nice thing is that the drivers seat has a lumbar support that blows up to the size of the Goodyear Blimp This review will share some of my experiences in the car First thing the car makes bumps feel like craters in the ground You will feel every little pothole in the road will tooth jarring clarity SOmetimes when driving the car when I hit a bump my arm smacks the armrest made out of hard plastic and my arm feels like it fractures The car has an annoying feature of the window opening all the way when just pushed down a little on the drivers side Since I like to crack the window even in the winter I hit the down button just a touch but the whole window opens This does not not_say not_a not_lot not_for not_the not_struts not_shocks not_or not_the not_armrest not_Next not_item not_the not_car not_sits not_straight not_up not_and not_down not_I not_thought not_that not_I not_would not_be not_lying not_down not_and not_driving not_with not_an not_arm not_extended not_but not_this not_is not_not not_the not_case not_I not_sit not_very not_up not_and not_down not_just not_like not_driving not_a not_regular not_non not_sports not_sedan The headroom is OK but the car is cut in such a way that I have to be VERY careful when getting in and out not not_to not_smack not_my not_head not_Once not_I not_had not_to not_bend not_over not_so not_much not_to not_get not_into not_the not_drivers not_side not_that not_I not_pulled not_a not_muscle not_in not_my not_chest not_and not_was not_in not_pain not_for not_the not_whole not_next not_day However I am told this is standard on new cars as is the lack of a cigarette lighter so I suppose I ll just have to deal with it The car has standard airbags but no head airbags or side airbags so just make sure that if you plan on crashing you get into a head on collision not not_a not_side not_impact
Neg,There is a lot of rear end whine It feels like it will break apart over some of the bumps It sounds like a big rig is passing me but there is no truck there It is also very loud inside the car I can barely hear the stereo at cruise However all that changed when I realized that I spend very little time looking at the car and a lot of time being beaten to death by it on the road It wasnt not_long not_before not_I not_was not_wishing not_I not_had not_bought not_the not_Celica not_I not_shouldnt not_have not_gone not_and not_looked not_at not_the not_Celica not_once not_I not_bought not_the not_Mustang not_because not_I not_could not_kick not_myself The Celica is much more quality oriented the ride is smoother and the image suggests that I am not not_a not_redneck not_idiot not_Mustang not_suggests not_a not_redneck not_with not_grease not_under not_the not_nails not_and not_an not_inferiority not_complex Driving the Mustang with its hard seats lack of lumbar support and a hard as a rock suspension is like riding a real mustang and you will get saddle sores I looked over the field before I bought the Mustang and it had the power edge All I was interested in at the time was power and edgy looks I also just had to have a convertible
Neg,The gas mileage for the highway is very good It comes with basically power everything seats windows door locks The car looks very sporty and has plenty of curves It comes with either a V6 or V8 engine and hard top or convertible At one point I loved this car so much I gave it a pet name If you have the money it can be worth getting but unless Ford wouldnt not_even not_honor not_any not_part not_of not_the not_warranty and my family had been buying cars from that dealer for years If you want looks the Mustang is nice but if you want reliability stay far away from this car When you drive this car you can feel every bump in the road and it gets to be uncomfortable after a while My car has a very loud and obnoxious engine knock that wont go away except when I put high octane gas it in Ford made better quality cars it d be sufficient to say you might be throwing money down the toilet for this car The controls on the car are easy to reach and not not_difficult not_to not_figure not_out And being short the power seats were very much appreciated It also comes with tilt steering and airbags and four disk brakes ABS at that time was an option for the car I believe which I didnt not_have Secondly I had to spend another four hundred dollars to get the frame fixed in the back because somehow it had cracked and i have never been in an accident The car was horrible in the winter well if you consider going up a hill sideways in the snow bad Of course any sports car in the winter is a challenge to drive The one thing against Ford and their sports cars compared to Chevy is that the older Mustangs are a little bit underpowered considering what the Camaro has even though with the newer model Mustangs they increased the horsepower Things tend to shake and rattle in the car at times because of bumpy roads but for the most part this car is best suited for an even well paved road because then the road is smooth and relatively quiet The seats were very comfortable with the

not_crazy not_really not_just not_a not_little not_too not_attached Why you ask I ll tell you First of all my transmission went at 40 000 miles and that was about twelve hundred to fix I had another friend who had a 1994 Mustang GT and her transmission went at about 34 000 miles The car sucks up gas like theres no tomorrow in the winter it handles poorly in any type of bad weather condition and it seemed like any time i turned around something was going wrong with the car or something was breaking Then again maybe I just had a poorly manufactured Mustang In my opinion and im not not_a

not_manual not_transmission not_because not_the not_automatic not_isnt not_strong not_enough It gets about 27 miles to the gallon on the highway Local driving it gets about 17 to 20 depending on the stop and go of driving With the gas tank only being 15 4 gallons going to the gas station at times happens frequently but when you drive all over the place it is expected When that is done the engine purrs like a kitten and I love the way the engine sounds when I hit the accelerator hard I have had a few problems keeping the wheels aligned and it has wore down a lot of my tires but considering I tend to drive it hard at times I most likely am to blame the most for wear and tear and the tires To my best knowledge the 1994 3 8 L V6 Mustang has about 145 horsepower with 230 pounds of torque which to me isnt not_bad but compared to about 50 more horsepower with the Camaro Chevy puts Ford to shame if you want to see a comparison of the two I believe Vara has a review on these two cars I do

of all the trouble it has had its 80 000 miles strong and each time I have to go somewhere I still look forward to getting behind the wheel
Neg,This is only a rare occurrence Yes the mustang is a great muscle car But that is it Now for the negatives The windshield wiper relay function works only on occasion There is virtually no head room and no back seat room About a year ago I bought a Mustang GT to fulfill a dream The windshield is small and you will find yourself looking around the rearview mirror The seats are comfortable and the layout of the inside is shaped somewhat like a mini cockpit For starters the gas mileage is unreal 18 Miles to the gallon if you drive like a retired old person If you drive like a 16 year old you are looking at about 10 miles to the gallon It handles great in dry weather and handles better than expected on rain DO NOT DRIVE ON SNOW One would think they would have improved the quality by now and maybe have some pride in building their cars Dont get me wrong I love Honda cars I think they are the most reliable but not not_most not_powerful The automatic transmission died and had to be rebuild for a whopping 2000 The Idle sometimes is too low and the car shuts off at stop lights The ride is super rough I live in NY and the potholes here are unreal And in a Mustang they feel like the grand canyon As many others I always loved the mustang Finally I was able to buy one I was very lucky because I found one that was only driven on the weekends The tires are expensive and dont not_last not_too not_long not_so not_many not_little not_things not_I not_could not_go not_on not_forever not_I not_do not_not not_comprehend not_why not_Ford not_continues not_to not_build not_vehicles not_so not_unreliable not_and not_with not_so not_many not_defects It will last longer and save you money in the long run I personally will never buy a ford vehicle after this experience Even though I kind of love the Mustang and dont not_really not_what not_to not_give not_it not_up not_I not_am not_looking not_into not_buying not_some not_little not_Honda not_for not_everyday not_use The bottom line is this is not not_a not_car not_but not_a not_toy not_which not_has not_to not_be not_taken not_care not_of not_greatly not_and not_can not_only not_be not_abused not_on not_occasion not_I not_would not_recommend not_having not_a not_small not_reliable not_Japanese not_car not_that not_saves not_lots not_of not_gas not_so not_you not_can not_have not_that not_for not_everyday not_use not_and not_drive not_the not_mustang not_only not_on not_the not_weekends Take the bus I love the rumble sound that comes out of the dual exhaust I love the looks you get when you drive it I love how you can blow away most of these little Honda cars that have all kinds of work done to the engines and they still sound like lawn mowers The previous owner took really good care of it Everyone thought I had bought a brand new car I wanted to buy a stick shift vehicle but This vehicle was in such good shape that I opted to buy it even though it was an automatic A decision I have lived to regret More on that later Driving this vehicle is awesome Lots of power even for an automatic
Neg,The rear seats are very small Not to mention the trouble spots My test GT came with the automatic transmission It makes the seats even more hospitable My test GT made a LOT of noise Unfortunately my test GT was plagued with problems The front hood vents look nice but serve no purpose The Cobras 5 spoke 17 inch alloy wheels look great The standard GT wheels look okay but I prefer the Cobras INTERIOR It is available with either a 5 speed manual or a 4 speed automatic The GT comes with a more powerful 5 0 liter OHV pushrod V8 engine The Mustangs pony car styling was redesigned for 1994 with a sexy more rounded body The controls are easy to use and reach Build quality is sub par It makes 215 horsepower at 4 200 rpm and 285 lb ft of torque at 3 300 rpm The long heavy doors are a nuisance in tight spaces and when parked sideways on hills This years body styling is a far cry from the boxy angular Mustang that debuted in 1979 Other than that there is more than enough passing power and a LOTS of low end torque There is more than enough lateral grip in the corners and overall is very fun to fling around corners There is absolutely no leg room for the long legged and even people about 5 feet 5 inches will feel confined With a stiffer suspension than ordinary Mustangs Cobras came only with a 5 speed manual and had standard ABS as well as a slightly different styling EXTERIOR With either transmission the torque comes on very quickly but has the tendency to run out of breath after about 5 000 rpm With a longer wheelbase and a few extra hundred pounds than the 93 model the ride is still stiff but not not_as not_jarring not_as not_before The standard engine is a 3 8 liter OHV pushrod V6 engine that produces 145 horsepower at 4 000 rpm and 215 lb ft of torque at 2 750 rpm The Cobra uses a modified version of the GTs V8 and produces 240 horsepower at 5 000 rpm but the same 285 lb ft of torque at a higher 4 000 rpm If wind noise is not not_intruding not_at not_speeds not_above not_65 not_mph then the rather loud exhaust engine noise is The interior looks very old school with cheap looking hard plastic everywhere The owner received 4 no that is NOT a typo recalls during his entire ownership of the car For more info about these recalls visit this website http www nhtsa dot gov cars problems He said that he had replaced it with a rebuilt automatic transmission that had 50 000 miles on it and within 5 000 miles started acting up again The V6 when paired with either transmission is adequate enough for most situations but I did notice that when paired with the automatic it was a little reluctant to downshift If you shop for a V8 model it would be wise to have another car in your garage for when the weather gets wet or you need the cargo room to haul The front seats are comfortable enough for long drives but for tall people like myself there is just not not_enough leg room to stretch out and be REALLY comfortable I like the GTs power lumbar support feature optional There is a chattering noise that can be felt coming from the rear during tight turns after highway driving I read that this is caused by a defect in the clutch packs in the Traction Lok PosiTrac differential The Ford Mustang was redesigned for 1994 although it was still based on a modified Fox chassis called Fox 2 that dated back to 1979 Hatchbacks were discontinued but coupes and convertibles remained Compared to the previous generation the 94 Mustang was longer wider and lower Although the Cobra never feels weak at low rpms its engine was tuned for more mid range torque and all but eliminates that weak top end feeling that ruins the GT models fun I averaged 15 7 mpg on the recommended premium fuel but Ford says mid grade 89 octane fuel is reasonable HANDLING The GTs suspension is poorly damped and feels like it is crashing over large bumps Even on apparently flat smooth roads you can still feel the GT jumping on occasions picking up even the smallest road imperfection Although the Cobra model has a stiffer suspension it rides very much the same as the GT RELIABILITY When I put it in OverDrive it had the tendency to slip and then the engine would flare to rather high rpms depending on how hard the gas pedal is pressed According to the owner when the Mustang had about 70 000 miles on it the transmission did the same thing Make sure that if you decide to buy a Mustang GT with an automatic transmission have a dealer check it for any problems VALUE All Mustangs deliver good performance at a reasonable price and should be an attractive buy for anyone at any age The V6 model is more of a daily driver than the Cobra or GT but is not not_as not_quick The weak four cylinder engine was also discontinued A 145 horsepower V6 engine was standard while the GT used a 215 horsepower V8 A Borg Warner T5 5 speed manual transmission was standard an electronically controlled 4 speed automatic optional Although all Mustangs for 1994 had 4 wheel disc brakes anti lock brakes were optional Convertibles included a power top and glass rear window with an optional rear defogger Mustang Cobras came with a powerful 5 0 liter 240 horsepower V8 and were sold in limited numbers The mere act of entering the backseat requires a gymnastic that most people will find a hassle Just to get in you have to duck under the low roofline or risk bumping your head squeeze between the seat and the doorjamb and be prepared to have your knees digging into the drivers or front passengers seat if you are tall Trunk space is insufficient for everyday living If you plan on keeping a Mustang as your weekend sports car then there is enough room to carry a few golf bags and other stuff ENGINE There is more body lean than expected in ALL models but nosedive is serious only on the base and GT models I feel the steering wheel could be stiffer than it is on the base and GT models but the Cobras is nicely weighted for sporty driving Unfortunately all Mustangs of this model year have the tendency to have their tail ends skip around bumpy corners All Mustangs have a problem when it comes to handling in wet weather All models spin the tires when trying to come up a hill after a stop if you are not not_very not_careful not_with not_the not_throttle not_Snow not_practically not_immobilizes not_the not_Mustang not_RIDE
Neg,Who cares I always wanted The Mustang It has been serviced well by the way so I dont not_feel not_that not_it not_is not_the not_problem It is fun to drive most of the time I have not not_been not_totally not_pleased not_with not_the not_performance not_of not_this not_car And a convertible to boot I bought this car after a divorce and I wanted something with some muscle and I wanted to go topless This car left me longing for much more power though and I think I would shop around more the next time I want a sports car You lose a lot of power and performance as well as my transmission is going out at only 100 000 miles maybe thats why I call her Christine The first year it seemed to have a lot more power than it does 4 years later I understand that an engine will lose some power but I feel a significant loss in mine If you want looks and a fun car to drive you probably cant not_go not_wrong but of you want speed and performance then look again Also I do not not_recommend not_an not_automatic not_in not_this not_car These turned out to be the best parts of this machine I liked the power it had although it needed more and it gets a lot of looks on the freeway from the opposite sex maybe because it was red or topless It has also been in the shop a lot for some steering problems and items that should have lasted longer than they did I like the tightness of the car and the steering It reminds me of the 79 Trans Am if anyone has ever driven one
Neg,My strong recommendation if you are interested in a 1994 Mustang is to check its history Find out if it was recalled for the head gasket before purchasing it because mine went FAST Also I was plagued with permanently squealy brakes that noone could figure out so make sure it has a good radio to drown out that annoying noise Id had transmission problems with my 93 so I was happy that it only cost 200 to get it fixed this time but within 3 months I was sorry I ever purchased the car At 136 k miles the head gasket blew When I called the dealership to get a quote on repairs I was told there had been a recall on this car so I took it down there after the engine had cooled back down Turns out Ford wont back their cars after 100k and I was going to be stuck with 1200 1500 bill to fix it I traded it in got less than 1 3 of what i paid for it and got a 1996 Thunderbird and its a very solid car I bought a 1994 Mustang LX coupe for a decent price but quickly learned it was not not_quite not_a not_solid not_vehicle not_After not_having not_owned not_3 not_Mustang not_convertibles not_in not_the not_past not_I not_was not_confident not_that not_the not_new not_body not_style not_wouldnt not_have not_been not_a not_compromise not_in not_quality but from the day I brought it home it had problems I was told that I would have to replace the transmission to fix the shutter but a full servicing fixed that problem for the most part it still didnt not_shift not_quite not_right but the shutter disappeared
Neg,UPDATE That is not not_a not_problem not_in not_the not_Focus not_Wagon As you can see the noise is painful I am writing this update after owning my 2001 Ford Focus wagon only 4 1 2 months The tech described the sound and discomfort to when his ear drum broke a few months back The tech then called the engineering department at Ford to find out how to deal with the problem Now narrowed down to body type I went on my search of different makes and models of station wagons If you are looking for something affordable roomy and has great gas mileage the Ford Focus Wagon is worth the money So I knew if I wasnt not_getting not_another not_gas not_eating not_van not_it not_would not_have not_to not_be not_some not_sort not_of not_station not_wagon When the service tech was in the car for a drive to understand the problems noted to him my husband rolled down the windows My first fill up after driving about 110 highway miles and then some city driving also I figured the Focus Wagon got around 27 mile to the gallon The engine in mine is a Zetec 4 25 L It still has pep but doesnt need a lot of gas to achieve the goal After taking my vehicle to the auto dealership to have them investigate why when the windows go down especially the rear ones an extremely loud and painful vibration occurs We all know you get what you pay for and maybe thinking it is cheaper because it is lacking in features How discouraging to buy a brand new car and be making payments and cant not_even not_roll not_down not_my not_windows not_Beware not_when not_checking not_into not_purchasing not_this not_vehicle The gas mileage is the most important feature of this vehicle With todays gas prices going up this is a must feature to be looking at when choosing a new car This is far from the truth The Focus Wagon has standard features such as power door locks power windows CD player air conditioning and cruise control Unfortunately ABS breaks are not not_a not_standard not_feature and cost around 350 400 to have the option included The storage space in the back is extremely roomy and the pull over cover is an added plus I went shopping for 2 weeks of groceries for a family of 5 and had no problems getting all the bags in comfortably Space is definitely not not_a not_problem The engineer had no idea as to how to fix the problem and said he had a stack of similar complaints on his desk Ford is selling Focus wagons knowing there is a window problem I am now in the process of finding out how to handle this problem The ease of getting in and out of the car was another factor in my purchase Unlike a lot of small cars the Focus Wagon seats sit higher I really like the crank under the seat to adjust the seating height I hate sitting in a car where my head almost touches the roof We are spending too much on gas for that van I told my husband With that comment I went on my search for a new vehicle I knew I needed and wanted something big enough to still haul stuff like lumber or my kids bikes A regular car trunk just isnt not_deep not_enough not_for not_transporting not_lumber not_or not_long not_items My first priority was price Being a family of 5 money is tight and I needed something affordable but of good quality I checked the prices of the VW Jetta wagon and the Saturn wagon Both were quite a bit more expensive The Ford Focus was by far the more affordable of the three Having access to a Ford A plan was another deciding factor Ford also at the time of my purchase was offering rebates and interests rates of 500 00 cash back 6 9 interest or 1000 00 cash back and 7 99 interest

Neg, i bought my 1995 Ford Windstar GL brand new in 1995  i must have been drunk it was  18 000 with tax  and came with the 3 8L MPFI V 6 i have been the only owner of this Windstar and i Always take good care of all my vehicles  personally changing the oil religiously every 3000 miles  keeping them washed  engines always clean enough to eat off of  armor all the tires every week  etc  i am a car freak and enjoy taking care of my stable but within 3 years  this Ford Windstar received no less than 7 Factory Recalls some of the major ones are  Defective Head Gasket  but they wouldnt fix or replace unless there was Visible damage already  ie  white smoke  overheating  etc  the Ford dealership told me Not to bring it in for the   Recall Fix   unless it was already Broken  GRRR  Hood Separation at High Speed  the recall notice said at high speeds   the flimsy plastic hood may Separate  so they applied more glue to my hood  Side Door Reinforcement  the sliding side door needed to have a beam welded inside it  the Stupid Fat mechanic that was working on my car Cracked one of my inside door panels while performing this recall  when i informed the dealership of the damage  at first they Denied it  they said I broke it myself  after complaining to the service manager AND the dealership manager  they finally agreed to replacing the interior body panel the mechanic broke  but the part had to be Special Ordered  which took a week  and another few days for them to Install it  GRRR  Transmission Fluid Pan was Leaking like Crazy  it was leaking ATF fluid faster than i could pour it in  my van had first developed a slow tranny pan leak after about 10K miles  but the Ford dealership told me it was a   normal maintanance   problem and Not a Defect  so i had to fix it myself  grrrr  Gas Tank Reinforcement  the recall notice said the cheap plastic gas tank may Crack or Leak in high temperature conditions  so a flimsy metal strap was installed to   reinforce   it Nitpicky Complaints  the Rear Bench Seats are Very Heavy  have a friend help you remove install the rear bench seats or you ll mess up your back  the window cranks  on non electric window  are in a very Awkward location  almost all the way to the floor and toward the front  Dont try to open close your windows while driving  Seatbelts are very uncomfortable  Rearview mirrors are awkward  especially at night  the Air Intake duct sits Very Low  sucking in air at tire level from the front driver side  Dont drive thru even low flood waters or your engine will suck in water right thru the air intake duct  this happened to a friend of mine as he drove thru a small puddle and his 3 8L engine was Mangled Needless to say  i will NEVER buy a Ford EVER again  what a complete Nightmare buy a Toyota or Honda instead  they are Worth the extra money 
Neg,The vehicle served us well but for a couple draw backs I bought this vehicle used in 97 and for the most part was satisfied but leery In the final days as owner we had numerous problems with the ignition switch and undetermined mis shifts from the transmission The ignition switch was replaced twice and in the end left my wife stranded road side while I was away on business The ride was comfortable if a little noisy inside and seats were excellent Configuration was OK and we enjoyed and miss the electronic dash that came as an option As far as draw backs go we drove it on vacation to Myrtle Beach from Ontario Canada and on arrival fortunately the head gasket blew as per the Ford recall they would only replace blown gaskets not not_fix not_on not_spec Ford was good I was in the States as a Canadian and covered it including towing 100 This was the final straw and we parted ways myself and the van not not_my not_wife I was leery of the transmission noises as the van is rated poorly for transmission problems and my fears in this regard contributed to our decision to go Japanese and get a 2000 Sienna All in all I did not not_hate not_the not_van not_but not_feel not_much not_as not_one not_does not_when not_a not_trusted not_friend not_starts not_to not_talk not_behind not_your not_back not_betrayed
Neg,The overheating apparently caused the service engine light to appear Some problems were never fixed and were hard to trace We took the van back twice for service but the problem was never fixed We only gave up on fixing this problem after several major problems overshadowed the minor one The car always intermittent indicated that one door was ajar Usually this happened going around corners and over bumps I purchased a 1995 Ford Windstar in 1998 with 45 000 miles already on it From the first day we experienced problems that were minor and later had major problems We eventually got too frustrated with the van failing and using tow trucks and finally traded it in on a Toyota RAV 4 Brand new I ll tell you about the RAV 4 in another review The van had 110 K miles on it in the end We performed minor repairs on the Transmission that cost 150 but the transmission still slipped but only when placed in reverse The first major problem was the battery went dead which by itself is not not_major not_however not_we not_tried not_to not_jump not_start not_the not_car not_which not_ended not_up not_burning not_out not_the not_on not_board not_computer not_Battery not_cost not_plus not_tow not_was not_100 When diagnosed we discovered that the oxygen sensor was now faulty Estimated cost to repair about 300 Now the O D overdrive light on the van began to blink and the transmission started to slip I was told directly related to the overheating A repaired transmission was quoted at between 1200 1500 we didnt not_even not_ask not_how not_much not_for not_the not_O not_D not_blinking not_light not_to not_be not_fixed The second time the battery went dead was within the next two days Again a tow was in order and a bill for 300 for the onboard computer Next the car overheated and was localized to the water pump Again not not_a not_significant not_problem not_by not_itself but later the van continued to overheat Cost for the water pump I dont not_remember but we eventually replaced the heads on the engine for 900

Neg, Note All of the bad things I am about to say about the Ford Windstar only affect Windstars with the 3 8 litre engine  This is the engine used in over 90  of Windstars  even the base models  but if you have one with the old underpowered 3 0 litre you should be alright My parents bought a 95 Windstar LX loaded with most options in 97  It had about 50000km on it  We really liked it  It was in perfect shape when we got it and we bought it from a dealership we had bought from before and they were really good to us  The bad part of the story doesnt start until our last year of owning the vehicle We got an extended warranty on the van because our previous vehicle that we traded in on it  a 93 Mercury Sable  had quite a few problems before the warranty ran out and we didnt want to have to pay a lot of money to keep the thing running  The extended warranty went to about 120000km I think  For the whole warranty period we didnt have one problem with the van  It ran perfect  had good power  was comfortable and we really liked it  I cant remember us having any problems with it at that time The bad news happens later on around 145000km we got a recall notice  actually an extended warranty on a defective Ford product  stating that they will cover the cost of repairs to the head gasket on Ford Windstars up to a certain mileage and date  not very far ahead of the current date at that time  We took the van in to our local dealership  not the one we bought the van at  and this was a big mistake  They say they checked it out and the headgasket was fine  About a month later  past the extended warranty date for the headgasket  at 150000km my parents were driving on the freeway and all of a sudden cold air blew through the heater  Then my dad noticed the temperature gauge was almost as high as it could go  He immediately pulled over  When he opened the hood there was antifreeze everywhere  They got it towed back to the local dumbas  dealership  They looked at it and basically said  Sorry  its not covered anymore  Its gonna run you  1800 2000 to get fixed  Needless to say my dad was kind of ticked off  The next decision we made was a good one  We called the good old dealership we bought it at  who we had been unfaithful to by bring the van to the other dealer in the first place  They told us they would come pick up our van  from the local dealership  and tow it for free out to their dealership  There had been a lot of complaints to Ford and we were waiting to hear there decision on whether or not they would cover the cost  Meanwhile my mom has to drive to work every day  a 45 minute trip  and my dad has to drive to work at a different time in the morning and a different direction  Our only running vehicle at this time was the trusty old 1983 Pontiac Grand Prix  still running at this time  We called the dealership to see if they could do anything about this and the guy we bought the van off called Ford and seemed to really make some noise  Anyways in no time at all he got Ford to pay half the cost and he decided to chip in 1 4 of the cost  This left us to pay only 1 4 of the cost and we were pretty happy about this  A week later we got a letter from Ford saying that they were sorry but there is nothing they could do  This notice meant nothing because our dealership had already got Ford to pay half  If he hadnt done that we would have been stuck with a big repair bill  In the end the dealership replaced the headgasket and while the engine was out they replaced the spark plugs which did need replacing and they also replaced a belt that was worn  Even with all of this the total bill came out to about  1200 which we paid 1 4 of  This was much less than the estimate the a hole at the other dealership gave us The van seemed to be running fine after this and we were planning on keeping it for a while still  However about a month later with about 155000km on the van mom said something weird happened a couple times when she stopped at a redlight  When she stopped at a redlight and then started to go again she stepped on the gas but the engine just revved up like it was in neutral and then clunked into gear with a lurch  We had a trusted transmission mechanic take it for a test drive but it didnt do anything wrong when he was driving it and it didnt most of the time when we were driving it  He said he would have to take the tranny out to find out if anything was actually wrong and thats already getting into big money  We decided to trade it in as soon as possible on a smaller more economical car  We traded it in and it had seemed to be working alright until the day we were driving it in to pick up our new car  the worst possible time  it started going into neutral at stoplights a few times and when my dad pulled into the parking lot of the Dodge dealer  My dad felt terrible and was really upset by ripping off the Dodge dealer but if we hadnt traded it in we would have been broke  Ford puts cheap a  parts in their vehicles that are known to fail and the customer ends up paying for it in the end Our Windstar gave us reliable transportation most of the time we owned it  The only other problem we had was when we were in Florida the starter connections had gotten corroded and the van wouldnt start  We couldnt get it started even with a boost and had it towed to a Ford dealer  They claimed it was a dead battery so they would rip us off when it only needed a new  5 part  Ford dealerships suck  I only know of the one good one that saved us a lot of money on our blown headgasket  Our Windstar was totally reliable up until about 150000km but thats when the whole friggin drivetrain gave out  This is unacceptable especially considering how much it costs to get these parts replaced  Its also almost impossible for most people to work on these vehicles  Our 1983 Pontiac Grand Prix has never once been in a garage the whole 3 5 years we have owned it  We do all the work on it ourselves and have spent about  100 in repairs the whole time we have owned it The other day I just got off a long day of work and was driving in the grand prix with the windows up and the stereo turned up and there was a windstar on my right with a Quebec license plate and he had his left turn signal on  I figured he didnt know where he was going and was trying to get somewhere so I slowed down a bit to let him change lanes in front of me  He didnt change lanes and I soon realized his had his 4 way flasher on not his signal light and he was going about 25km h in a 50km h zone  Dont know why I thought he was turning  but anyways all of a sudden I realized I could hear an extremely loud knocking coming from the Windstar engine  Right away I thought of our old van and all the complaints about the Windstars that I had read  I passed the van and a little ways up the road I stopped in at a car lot to casually look at cars and listen to the racket from the Windstar as it passed by  I waited for it to come over the hill and I could hear it before I saw it  It was the loudest  most unhealthy knocking ive ever heard from any engine  That engine had to be TOAST  It looked like they were just trying to make it to their destination and give up on the vehicle  If its knocking that loud you dont keep driving it unless your not worried about fixing it anyways  It sounded like the engine was about to blow up right then literally  Its undescribable  im a major car nut and obsessed with engines and this was kind of amusing to me to be able to listen to an engine in such bad shape    I thought it was fun but I definately wouldnt tell the owner of the van that  Anyways with the amount of 95 Windstars giving up the ghost out there  you are bound to see something like this eventually Now that ive told you all the bad things about the 95 Ford Windstars I ll talk about the good things about it Performance  The engine had good torque and power at all speeds  The transmission shifted extremely smooth most of the time that we owned it  The gas mileage that we got was surprisingly good for a van with this big of an engine  Handling was alright for a van and the brakes worked really good  Comfort Features  The front seats were really comfortable  The back seats werent great for long trips and were impossible to fall asleep in but our van didnt have the bucket seats in the back  it just had 2 benches  The buckets seats  actually called captains chairs I guess  are a lot more comfortable  The air conditioning worked great with the rear air  There are vents in the ceiling that work good to keep all passengers cool  You can close the vents if you want  The rear heater was awesome  I guess it was kind of a safety hazard as it could melt a plastic bag if one was left right next to the vent on the side of the floor  But it sure heated us up fast in the winter  There are plenty of lights in the van all the way to the back so you can see in the dark  There was 3 power outlets in the van which was handy  Sometimes I plugged in my Discman to the power outlet at the middle seat so I didnt waste batteries and on our trip to Florida we plugged a portable refrigerator thingy into the very back power outlet  This was really handy  The factory stereo only had a tapedeck and am fm but it was decent for a factory system  I also liked the design of the interior on this van  It was nicely done  Its hard to remember all the little features cause it was a while ago  but there were lots of them and it was nice Safety Most people know that the Windstar got rated for 5 star safety rating so I guess its pretty good for safety in a crash  Not so safe to get stranded out in the middle of nowhere in the winter but at least your safe in a crash I guess Anyways  as you can see I have plenty of good things to say about the Ford Windstar but I dont think they re worth it unless you re rich enough to be able to afford the repairs  In that case you could probably buy something a lot nicer than the Windstar though  I have heard a lot worse  Windstar Horror Stories  than ours since we only had the 2 major problems  I bet that guy from Quebec could tell you a good story about his Windstar  The newer ones have corrected some of the problems but on www cartrackers com  forums and then go to the Ford Windstar page  its the only vehicle that gets its own forum on here  lol or go to  My Lemon  there still seems to be a lot of problems with the newer Ford Windstars  I wouldnt recommend one  
Neg,From the time we picked up our 1995 Windstar we loved the ride But as many new vehicles are prone to this one was in the shop for tweaking a few times If you have not not_received not_this not_important not_notice be sure to contact Ford for whatever good that will do I HAVE EDITED THIS DUE TO A VERY MAJOR EXPENSE ENGINE FAILURE ON JANUARY 29 2000 PLEASE READ THE BOTTOM FOR NEW AND VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION The nearly 1 000 in repair bills was due to the structure of the engine which needed to be somewhat dismantled so that the mechanics could work on the problem labor costs This was probably an omen of things to come as we have had the brakes replaced at low mileage and under warranty because Ford claimed that they did not not_have not_the not_proper not_brakes not_to not_install not_in not_the not_first not_place not_when not_the not_vehicle not_was not_new not_I not_still not_dont not_understand not_that not_one not_Also not_the not_Check not_Engine not_Light not_is not_constantly not_on not_We not_have not_had not_it not_checked not_out not_several not_times not_when not_the not_vehicle not_was not_under not_warranty not_and not_they not_have not_not not_been not_able not_to not_find not_any not_cause not_for not_it not_nor not_could not_they not_fix not_it not_After not_the not_warranty not_expired not_we not_needed not_to not_have not_the not_Windstar not_serviced not_again not_because not_of not_an not_antifreeze not_leak not_this not_turned not_out not_to not_be not_a not_recall not_notice not_item not_but not_still not_cost not_us not_plenty Oh they said that we could take the chance and not not_get not_the not_repair not_work not_done not_since not_it not_was not_so not_costly not_but not_knowing not_that not_we not_could not_have not_major not_problems not_if not_we not_didnt not_fix not_it not_what not_else not_could not_we not_do not_but not_shell not_out not_the not_money not_to not_Ford not_MY not_HUSBAND not_TOOK not_THE not_WINDSTAR not_IN not_BECAUSE not_OF not_STRANGE not_SOUNDS not_IN not_THE not_ENGINE not_AREA not_2 not_WEEKS not_AGO not_AND not_WAS not_TOLD not_THAT not_AT not_79 not_000 not_MILES not_THE not_ENGINE not_NEEDED not_REPLACING not_THIS not_WILL not_COST not_US not_3 not_000 not_DOLLARS not_THE not_EXTENDED not_3 not_YEAR not_WARRANTY not_ON not_THIS not_WORK not_WILL not_COST not_ANOTHER not_1 not_634 not_00 not_WHEN not_THE not_DEALER not_WAS not_CALLED not_YESTERDAY not_TO not_CHECK not_ON not_THE not_PROGRESS not_OF not_THE not_WORK not_ON not_THE not_REBUILT not_ENGINE not_WE not_WERE not_TOLD not_THAT not_THE not_LIFTERS not_ARE not_BAD not_TOO not_THIS not_WILL not_ADD not_ANOTHER not_200 not_00 not_TO not_THE not_COST You bet Ford will get a letter on this one AND THEN SOME I thank goodness for the communication possibilities of the internet because I did a search on Ford Windstar Recall Notice and was alarmed to find that thousands of people who have purchased the 1995 Ford Windstar are having similarly costly expenses and all seem to be pretty much the same in the nature of the repair work Although it is comforting to know that we are among a large group of people having the same wallet draining experience I believe that it is time for the rest of the silent majority to speak up If enough of us get to the point of saying im not not_going not_to not_put not_up not_with not_the not_way not_we not_re not_treated not_by not_the not_Ford not_Motor not_Company not_we not_should not_be not_able not_to not_force not_Ford not_to not_put not_out not_a not_recall not_on not_the not_engine not_so not_that not_they not_must not_pay not_for not_the not_trash not_we not_are not_stuck not_with not_One not_last not_note not_before not_I not_end not_this not_ranting not_through not_my not_research not_of not_dissatisfied not_customers not_on not_the not_internet not_I not_learned not_that not_the not_recall not_notice not_on not_the not_head not_gasket not_problem not_was not_apparently not_not not_received not_by not_everyone
Neg,I bought this vehicle when expecting my first child The exact thing that the recall was for happened in November 99 I was informed that the recall had expired and they could do nothing for me I had the problem fixed by an independent mechanic Approximately two weeks later I received another recall on the fuel tank This time stating that it could fall off the vehicle I definitely feel that unless you are willing to deal with the recalls and repairs you should not not_purchase not_this not_van not_I not_do not_not not_know not_of not_the not_status not_of not_the not_newer not_models but I am not not_willing not_to not_take not_my not_chances not_and not_buy not_another not_Ford not_Windstar We chose the Windstar because it had excellent safety ratings I like the way the minivan looks and rides I have enjoyed the car overall until the last 3 months or so I received a Recall in 98 on a certain engine part that could cause the head gasket to blow I took the van to my local dealer from which I bought the vehicle and they claimed to find no problem and therefore would not not_replace not_a not_part not_that not_wasnt not_broken
Neg,Now they expect me to invest more than 1000 in head gaskets that may last what maybe 10 000 miles maybe 25 000 And I thought quality was Job 1 HA At 40 000 miles I replaced head gaskets and had the transmission rebuilt in my 95 Windstar Ten months ago at 72 000 miles the engine was replaced The bottom line is that they know this engine is flawed and they cant not_figure not_out not_how not_to not_fix not_it and they wont stand behind it Take my advice if anyone offers to sell or even give you one of these things run away screaming This is to say nothing of brake jobs every 25 000 miles and numerous electrical problems I wont bore you with a long defense but in case you re wondering this van is not not_driven not_hard not_Today not_I not_learned not_that not_the not_head not_gaskets not_must not_be not_replaced not_again not_but not_that not_I not_am not_4 not_000 not_miles not_over not_the not_12 not_month not_12 not_000 not_mile not_warranty not_Ford not_refuses not_to not_bend not_the not_rules
Neg,Which was a 1200 repair I have 1995 Ford Windstar that now has 72000 miles on it The van is great to drive and the interior has worn well and still looks great But mechanically the poor Ford has had it I had to replace the head gaskets at 70000 miles My next vehicle will be an import I also have a 1987 Toyota with 149000 miles and have never done anything to it but oil tires amp brakes Maybe one day Ford will be able to build a quality product and when they let a bad motor get off the production line they should stand behind it So I went ahead and had it fixed 3 weeks later while returning from a funeral out of town the van broke down and left me on the side of Interstate 81 in the middle of the night I had the van towed back home only to find out that it had broken a connecting rod and I have to replace the motor A 3500 repair This bothered me but I figured after 70000 miles it could be worse I then found out that Ford knew this was a problem with all of their 3 8 liter V6s that year and even had a program to replace the head gasket for free if the van had 60000 miles or less I contacted my local Ford dealer and Fords Quality Care department both said they could be of no help because I had more then 60000 miles on the van
Neg,My dad had always wanted a van We lost 2500 because of Fords incompetence Well a few months later the head gasket broke He decided to try ford again He purchased a 1995 model white paint and white interior In the end it was the head gasket again It was a good vehicle for the first few thousand miles It cost us 1500 dollars to replace the head gasket He had owned an LTD ford wagon a white one with blue interior Mind you as soon as the warranty expired the transmission failed My dad just shook his head and hung up on them Who in their right mind would place a plastic gear in a transmission It was the best vehicle we had ever had to this day We had it overhauled and they couldnt believe the condition of the transmission It would overheat momentarily and then suddenly it would go back to normal They said it was time for our 85 000 mile checkup on our van The car ran fine for an other year until the warrantees on the engine and the transmission expired With our horrible luck a week later we got a letter in the mail recalling our model van for the head gasket It cost us over a thousand dollars to get it replaced and to our disdain we find that the transmission was built with a plastic gear Then he managed them to pay for the labor the 1500 but refused to pay for the engine which had failed due to their faulty gasket This time they said 2500 My dad said forget it We traded it in for a Pontiac Grand Am after that which is a great car White smoke billowed out of the exhaust and the car overheated like mad I did everything i could do to get it home And then my father had to fight ford to pay us anything Initially they offered to pay us for the head gasket itself which was only 200 We love it Someone bought our van by the way For 2000 Didnt even get it off the lot the engine locked up on them Ford called our house shortly after we bought our new car It ran fine for a few days but a mysterious knocking and loss in power suddenly appeared Antifreeze from the head gasket had worked its way down to the crankshaft and corroded the bearings and because of this we had to replace to whole engine Then just our luck the transmission failed again I was driving one day and the car started jerking Then it rode ok after i put some transmission fluid in it but it wouldnt not_change not_out not_of not_second not_gear They thought it was the original transmission and thought the van had to at least have had over 100 000 miles but their jaws dropped when we told them the transmission was less than a year old A few days after that the engine started overheating
Neg,The inside is my favorite part I just cannot not_believe not_how not_nice not_this not_van not_is not_My not_overall not_opinion not_is not_spend not_the not_money not_and not_purchase not_this not_van It is well worth every cent I love mine and when the time comes to retire it I will surly purchase another Ford Windstar We purchased this van to provide adequate space for our family during travel Boy did we get more than we expected This Van has not not_only provided us with the space we needed but we also have so many options and luxuries Beginning with the outside of the van We bought a 95 model the paint is in immaculate condition Looks brand new two tone paint green and tan Love the combination Engine Clean runs great sounds and drives like brand new van Not bad for 5 years old Looks like this one may be worth the money Interior Excellent Spacious Comfy seating with adequate leg room Not cramped Many options inside ie lumbar in front seats adjustable seat belt height heated outside mirrors and lots of extra storage room

Neg,This van is great for families who have several kids with lots of friends We bought this vehicle to haul seven people around town but we have used it for schelpping ping pong tables trampolines and more It is safe and comfortable but it has had MANY MAJOR reliability problems over the past years and has NOT been driven that much Seriously investigate reliability before purchasing The options you have to buy to make this a decent car power windows locks make the price uneccisarily high Overall I would not not_purchase not_this not_vehicle not_without not_some not_kind not_of not_statement not_guarantee not_additional not_insurance not_from not_Ford But I must say this van has tons of cargo room and seating comfort especially with the captain seating option
Neg,As our kids grew the van became smaller and smaller It drove fairly well more like a car than a van We looked at several used models and finally settled on a 1995 Ford Windstar GL But alas this was not not_to not_be not_During not_the not_time not_we not_owned not_our not_Windstar not_it not_came not_under not_various not_recalls But the steering ratio was horrid Although we were told the van was the largest among the minivan class we soon discovered this was not not_interior not_space It had less than 30 000 miles on it and had been a rental model for the dealership so we felt fairly confident it had been serviced properly An adult could not not_comfortably not_squeeze not_into not_the not_3rd not_row not_seat not_at not_all not_Door not_latches broke power windows malfunctioned cassette player stopped working And that was in 2 years of ownership When we found out about our 3rd pregnancy we also found out that our nice Explorer had to go Why Because our 3rd pregnancy was resulting in our 3rd and 4th children yep twins Each time we took it in it wouldnt not_be not_properly not_repaired and the recalled item would have caused more damage to the engine that would not not_be not_covered not_resulting not_in not_money not_out not_of not_our not_pocket In fact our Windstar was traded in for our new Dodge Grand Caravan while in the shop for yet another repair Ford says its improved the Windstar I hope for the sake of consumers out there putting their trust in them they have As for me once bitten twice shy

Neg,So buyer beware Then it started overheating We checked the thermostat no problem My husband and I previously owned a Dodge Caravan we loved I bought the 95 Ford Windstar due to our 2 year old daughter and our future children On the way back from the beach we blew the head gaskets 1200 And now the transmission is acting iffy We found the Windstar for a great price 8000 with 89 000 miles Lots of miles but looked in good condition The van was great for the first 2 months then it got crazy First trouble with the air which turned out to be the computer 500 And at this point we have so much money invested in the car we cant not_sell so we are stuck driving it until it dies We had read Consumer Reports before we bought the van and it checked out Unfortunately we didnt not_wait not_long not_enough not_because not_now not_its not_coming not_out not_that not_its not_a not_lemon
Neg,No equipment failures on the Honda and I hear the same thing from many Honda Owners It was a fight to get reimbursed for my blown head gaskets back at 57 K miles I am an extremely unhappy owner of a 95 POC Windstar w 120K miles I am posting this so that potential Windstar owners know what to expect a few thousand miles down the road There is constantly something wrong with this car from electrical problems to AC problems to electrical door lock problems to chimes and warning lights always going off I religiously maintain this car following the Ford recommended maintenance to the T One month after my 120K maintenance in which they reportedly inspect the engine cooling system the POC left me stranded with a blown front cover gasket and a failed water pump The repair shop told me the warning signs should have been visible during the inspection I have performed extensive research on Windstar problems and know my situation is not not_isolated not_Both not_dealerships not_in not_the not_Charlton not_SC not_area not_Jones and Palmetto have lousy service departments and just give me the run around when I bring these issues up So beware potential Ford Windstar Owners Ford claims to have fixed the problem but do you want to take the chance Dont believe all the Ford Hype Our 91 Honda is running like an old reliable clock at 140 K with only routine maintenance
Neg,They are our worst customer I will no longer buy a FORD vehicle And over the years I have had a huge amount of trouble with the 4 wheel drive system The new FORD Focus has been out for less than a year and has had 5 recalls already The blowouts involving Firestone were mainly on original equipment tires not not_the not_aftermarket not_I not_no not_longer not_trust not_FORD not_or not_their not_products Their Q1 program is supposed to reduce costs such as waste and inefficiencies to allow the supplier to pass along the savings My guess is that they are cutting corners in quality which passes the initial FORD testing but is failing in the long run For the past 6 or so years to boost their profits they have demanded from all suppliers a 5 per year reduction in price Whats going on Since my company is a supplier to the automotive industry I can only assume that FORD will be going steadily downhill How many years in a row can you reduce your price and not not_cut not_back Could you work for 5 a year less every year Sooner or later you would need to cut back some critical area affecting your quality of life Well the same is true with suppliers you can only go so far Some suppliers have redesigned their product so they can sell a cheaper product Note My company supplies a non critical item Having been a FORD worshipper for many years I have finally de sourced FORD as a supplier for my family cars Dating back to to the late 1980s I had not not_purchased not_anything but FORD products From a Taurus Wagon to two Escorts and two Explorers FORD products were in my opinion the best quality cars suvs on the market Lately though I have changed my mind Yesterday I received my second recall letter in less than six months Everyone has heard of the Firestone fiasco Todays recall concerns the suspension system
Neg,Then it quit being cold The compressor went out AFTER THE FIRST USE But instead they fixed it and the bill was 1200 So back the the repair shop and 650 later we had A C for two weeks They could have charged it up and it would have lasted another 8 years The vehicle has plenty of great featurs and its comfortable but the modern technology comes at a great price as it ages We own a 1994 Ford Explorer with the Eddie Bauer package Its a great looking vehicle all the comforts you d want Leather seats Lumbar electronic everything We took it back and their new compressor had gone out but I made them pay for repair Another big headache was the Four Wheel Drive I need the four wheel drive daily because I live atop a large rocky hill Then a week later when it finally got warm enough to use the A C I tried it and the car died at 55 miles per hour I had to steer up a hill and off the road So for 400 a tire I got my 4WD back My last Chevy cost me 129 for a pair of hubs from Warn and I was back on the road but it cost over 900 to get the Explorer working again The most expensive component was the A C It eventually started getting warmer and warmer and this year we took it in to be charged Well that model already used R 134 But Ford charges a fortune for it Plus that had to fix the leak where ever that was A truck thats 8 years old didnt not_just not_spring not_a not_leak You push the button and the light comes on and you go up the hill Well eventually it got harder and harder to climb and then you d have to romp up it in order to get home Well after spending 450 in tires in one year I took it in the Ford dealer told me they just get old and lose their power Well I wasnt not_exactly not_convinced not_I not_jacked not_it not_up and there was no power at all I took it to a mechanic and he found the automatic hubs to be bad Well with the Explorer you have to get them from Ford no aftermarket available
Neg,We also had to replace the front stabilizer bar several times I purchased this vehicle in 1998 as it was coming off a lease The mileage was low and the body was in great condition and when I drove it there were no problems Since purchasing it though we have had quite a few problems Brakes went early and of course you all have heard about the tire recalls This was another recall but as a second owner we didnt not_hear not_about not_it and had to pay for it ourselves Finally our transmission died with still low mileage on the vehicle Doing some research online I found that this problem has happened to thousands of Ford owners and that Ford is aware of the problem but is unwilling to help with costs or to even address the issue See this website for an example http www carlounge com cgi carsbbs read php f 1 i 1722 t 1411 I decided to trade my car in since the cost to repair or replace the transmission was estimated at 2000 3000 I didnt not_get not_a not_whole not_lot not_for not_it not_certainly not_not not_blue not_book not_value not_since not_dealers not_are not_having not_a not_hard not_time not_reselling not_Fords not_I not_now not_have not_a not_used not_Infiniti not_Qx4 not_that not_has not_a not_7 not_year not_100 not_000 not_full not_warranty not_Cant not_beat not_that
Neg,All this by the way happened in less than 2 years of ownership The exterior matches the interior perfectly they are both plain boxy and offer a dated design The interior of the Pony is plain and as basic as it gets The car had less than 110 000 miles on it i Final Thoughts i A cheap car at a cheap price Before I bought my 94 Escort Pony now gone and in its place a 98 Sunfire GT I owned a 1990 Ford Escort Pony While not not_as not_refined not_as not_its not_successor not_1991 not_models not_and not_later not_the not_1990 not_Escort did have some good features considering the price This car isnt not_going not_to not_turn not_any not_heads not_except not_those not_who not_have not_joined not_the not_Ford not_Escort not_following not_cult The drivers seat was not not_comfortable and offered minimum support the same can be said for the rest of the seats in this car In late 1990 as a 91 model the Escort got a major face lift and interior engine changes which made its successor much more desirable NOTE The 90 horsepower is reached at a fairly low RPM so off the line acceleration is not not_too not_bad but this car obviously was not not_made not_for not_burning not_rubber The 4 speed is fairly low geared I do not not_know not_the not_final not_drive not_ratio not_however not_its not_low not_enough not_so not_you not_can not_hear not_the not_1 not_9 not_liter not_engine not_straining not_at not_highway not_speeds The Pony is only recommended as a last resort and if you can get a extremely good deal on one if not not_the not_1990 not_Escort should be avoided Happy Car Shopping The Escort which was given a face lift in 1988 does look a tad more sophisticated than its predecessor but still lacks modern styling Even back in 1990 this car was looked at as a dated design The 4 speed manual also was not not_accommodating not_in not_town not_as not_it not_would not_sometimes not_decide not_it not_did not_not not_want not_to not_shift not_into not_a not_certain not_gear not_at not_any not_certain not_time not_Cruising not_on not_the not_highway not_besides not_being not_noisy is also bumpy and aggravating This review is based on a 1990 Escort Pony The 1990 Ford Escort rides on a small 94 2 wheelbase and has an overall length of 169 2 The Suspension consists of Macpherson struts up front with coil springs and the same treatment in the rear i Interior Accommodation i The dashboard is downright dated and so is the rest of the interior My Pony came with no options whatsoever not not_even not_a not_stereo not_Manual not_windows and doors were a way of life Arm rests on the drivers doors were of cheap plastic but had fallen off after a few years of ownership The suspension is unforgiving and lets you know when you have hit a small bump or even when passing over reflectors on the road a hard jolt can be felt Handling is inadequate Significant roll can be felt and without power steering in the pony models you better have some muscular arms Note Many options are available on other models There is adequate room up front for small adults but even the front is cramped the rear was apparently made for children only My Escort Pony was a 2 door coupe so getting people in and out of this small car was a real pain especially since the passenger seats would not not_fold not_forward not_all not_the not_way not_Vision not_is not_limited not_With not_the not_claustrophobic not_feeling not_cabin not_and not_limited not_visibility not_driving not_this not_car not_was not_no not_picnic not_Exterior not_Innovation not_i In 1990 the Ford Escorts that were sold in America came with 2 engines a standard 1 9 liter CFI central fuel injection that produced 90 horsepower at 4 600 RPM and 106 lb ft of torque A 1 9 110 HP EFI efficient fuel injection engine is available for this year only in the Escort GT i Driving Impressions i My Escort Pony came equipped with the 90 HP CFI engine which gave this car almost adequate performance for hill climbing but was shy of having enough power in high gear to make it up hills without lugging down The 1990 Escort is offered in either a 2 door hatchback or 4 door hatchback Price Reliability An Escort Pony in 1990 with no options would run you around 6 000 dollars and 9 000 dollars for models like the LX Today with poor resale almost all models of the 1990 Ford Escort can be had for less than 2 000 I have seen them in papers for as low as 500 00 with claims like runs great As for reliability My Pony was a real nightmare Problems included worn Cv joints torn boots Tears in the pleather trimmed doors shifting problems a multitude of interior Leaks oil leaks hatch struts went out faulty gauges overheating drivers window would not not_roll not_up not_all not_the not_way not_and not_rust not_was not_found not_in not_the not_fuel not_lines
Neg,A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ME FIRST The newer style Escorts are a completely different story And that is exactly what happens The smaller the area the faster it will wear thats just basic physics This includes both the bushing on the strut rod and the inner pivot bushing The lower ball joints are another sore spot Not greasable and prone to rapid wear They are basically like mentioned above Mazda 323s and are miles apart from the older models in quality This is about the older Ford Escort the whole car including the steering and suspension system got a total re design for the 1991 model year The only real problem with the re designed Escorts are the outer tie rod ends like the older ones are not not_greasable and will wear out rapidly If you are considering an Escort from 1991 and newer it is a much wiser and acceptable decision and you should be pleased with this model The ball joints on this car are integrated into the complete control arm so when the ball joint portion wears you have to replace the complete lower control arm If the engineers designed it where the inner tie rods were more horizontally mounted there would be more surface area contacted and it would not not_wear not_as not_rapidly But now its too late they are committed to mass production Even when you replace the factory unit with an after market part the names still the same rapid wear This could really be a good thing though because you will get new bushings when you replace the ball joint but if you dont not_need not_bushings you have no choice and at over 125 00 each retail it is an expensive repair to replace both sides The design of the suspension is such that there is quite an angle from where the inner tie rods screw onto the steering rack down to the steering knuckle and this angle dictates that there will be a small contact area where the ball on the rack end of the inner tie rod contacts the bearing surface And even though the parts would be covered with proof of purchase and receipt from the garage you got it done at the labor would have to be covered by you and the hassle of another trip to the garage and being without your vehicle is enough to shy you away from one You can find some very well engineered and built suspensions these days but all the same some very weak and suspect ones in my experience and my purpose is to help you make a more informed decision After reading my reviews read some on other aspects of the car you re looking for from the experts here at epinions and make your choice NOW ON TO THE ESCORT I have read many reviews on automobiles from aesthetic interior power warranty options etc points of view I believe an important but always neglected area though is from a steering and suspension system point of view and let me tell you most people are missing a very important part of researching a prospective major purchase by not not_being not_well not_enough not_informed not_in not_this not_area There are many problems with other portions of the suspension on the Escort too like strut mounts and bearings but suffice it to say I am not not_at not_all not_recommending not_any not_of not_you not_to not_consider not_a not_used not_older not_Escort not_it not_just not_isnt not_worth not_it not_Even not_if not_you not_got not_one not_really not_cheap not_and not_got not_all not_of not_the not_front not_end not_parts not_replaced not_with not_lifetime not_warranty not_after not_market not_parts not_they not_will not_wear not_out not_due not_to not_extreme not_angles not_of not_operation It was then that the car was based on the Mazda 323 when Ford and Mazda had somewhat of a merger so this opinion is for the pre 1991 models Having the constitution of the United States on my side is a very good thing because there is not not_one not_redeeming not_quality not_about not_the not_suspension not_of not_the not_Escort and if they could the Ford Motor Company and its engineers would sue me for writing this First off nothing is greasable on the Escort and the tie rods both inner and outer wear out at a rapid rate as do the lower ball joints
Neg,It is also very boxy in shape and is very high off the ground The shifting is terrible and even though this car needs a new transmission we were told that is always will shift poorly Thankfully I do not not_own not_this not_car not_because not_if not_I not_did not_I not_would not_curse not_myself not_everyday not_for not_making not_such not_a not_terrible not_decision not_much not_as not_my not_boyfriend not_does The inside is not not_much better there is hardly any interior room and as unimportant as it is the controls are tacky and poorly placed However the biggest problem with the car is not not_all not_the not_maintenance not_it not_needed and still needs although that certainly doesnt help it is how terribly this car handles He has to replace the transmission the struts are crap and he severely needs new ones it is so bad that you get a headache from all the bumps and vibrations This car has cost my boyfriend almost as much as he paid for it in repairs and there is seriously always something wrong with it things he cant not_afford not_to not_fix It accelerates slowly and seemingly has no power Perhaps the only good thing about this car is the fact that it is reasonable on gas not not_great but not not_horrible either I definitely would not not_recommend not_this not_car not_it not_is not_known not_as not_a not_lemon not_among not_most not_people There were serious problems with the steering when he first got it that needed to be fixed immediately it had alternator problems and the list goes on there have been so many repairs its hard to keep track Many repairs can be expected with a used car but this is ridiculous If however you do decide to purchase an escort I would seriously recommend getting it looked at by a mechanic to assess the cost of repairs before you buy it So far you re probably thinking im unreasonable in my assessment but consider this the car only had 46000 miles on it when he bought it He bought this car nearly two years ago I told him then not not_to not_buy not_it and I still tell him now what a terrible deal it really was I have had the misfortune perhaps fortune since I will never have to deal with such an experience from this particular car of being present and experiencing every single one of this cars downfalls since the day he bought it Sometimes I even have to drive it myself when I am nice enough to let him borrow my wonderful Honda Civic For starters this car looks horrible form the outside I have never been able to get over where the side view mirrors are placed it looks absolutely ridiculous to have them sticking out right in the middle of the front door rather than at the front like most cars
Neg,They add a nice touch What tilt wheel The wheel caps are nice too This car doesnt have one They each have their own buckle The interior is small and very cramped To me a tilt wheel is a MUST There is little leg room in all four seats The rear two seats have a lap belt with a separate shoulder harness The transmission and the power steering dipsticks are NOT EVEN LABELED The front end looks big and old with the large 80s volvo like headlights The exterior is nothing special however the back end is quite nice looking The sun visors are very nice and have a covered mirror with lights You have to be small to drive this car Tilt wheel The seats are high off the floor and the lower cushions are thick There are coin holders below the shift lever and in the locking glove box The brake oil washer fluid and coolant fluids are easy to fill and find This review is on a 90 Escort LX 2 door HB THINGS THAT WENT WRONG The back seat cushion is tilted funny which makes it uncomfy It is my neighbors car and we used to go many places in it until I got my Corsica Well I dont not_exactly not_own not_this not_car but I have driven in it plenty of times over the last few years This is a plus Under the hood Under the hood of the LX you will find a weak 1 9L four Cyl engine My neighbor bought a brand new 1994 Escort and sold it within a year because it was ALWAYS in the shop John9740 as own ratings 1 low 2 3 4 5 high Power 2 front seats 3 back seat 1 trunk 2 brakes 2 reliability 1 room space 2 overall 2 5 but due to reliability I have to give it only sad stars This vehicle has only 98 000 miles on it but yet is breaks like it has 198 000 miles on it This car needs one significant repair at least once every two months Sometimes more From what I can remember these things went wrong Both door armrests and handles inside have fallen off She had to go to Sears and ask a worker which was which There is a light under there so you can see at night Please be sure to be VERY careful when buying this car If you arent rich then DOnt buy it FYI The ignition system needed replaced radio died A C died the headlights broke electrical and cost well over 200 to fix washer fluid pump oil leaked and needed fixed water pump died map lights stayed on and would not not_turn not_off not_which not_drained not_the not_battery not_clock not_wont not_work not_right not_engine had some problems auto trans is going to go bye bye soon brakes wear out fast and there have been many more problems that I dont not_want not_to not_bore not_you not_with not_Now not_back not_to not_the not_review not_Interior not_exterior
Neg,Try auctioning for a 90 escort on ebay The car started having more trouble after we patched her up The muffler fell off I bet it would have worked better if it were younger The transmission fluid tube that runs from the resevior to the transaxle came off on the interstate and I had to exit with my lurching car to the nearest service station If they list the cars faults it ll be busted transaxle on there for sure The Experience I may be the only person alive that was excited to get an escort I paid for it all by myself cash The Product The 1990 Escort LX the sporty version is a four door with hatchback model that I have owned for the last year 1 2 I have driven approximately 2000 miles on it This is due solely to the fact that there are parts missing from the transmission I believe this is due to somewhat poor maintenance on the part of the previous owners and second due to that the transaxle on this model down to the LX is considered crap We were aware it had a slow shift but had no idea how long it was going to be before the car was a goner I ll tell you the exact expiration date June 25th 2000 I was driving along on Kingston Pike in Knoxville TN when I heard a fire engine I glanced in my rearview mirror and the guy in front of me who I left well over two car lengths between STOPS with SUCH SPEED must be nice to have anti lock brakes a feature my escort didnt not_have that I SLAM on my brakes and my brakes lock and I smash into him We patched up the car We named her doo wop as she had never bebopped in her entire 10 year career as an automobile
Neg,This was the worst car I have ever owned Literally as the odometer rolled past 80 000 The fuel pump tranmission distributor cap spark plug wires CV axles both all went out Sure you are thinking this idiot never even changed the oil WRONG I know the importance of routine maintenance This car couldnt hold up to regualr weart and tear this must be why the Odometer has only 5 dgits on it it wont make it to six I know the car was never intended to be built like a tank thats why it costs as little as it does however everything is made of cheap plastic lacking any quality and value to the owner Also if you are even near 6 feet tall you will not not_fit not_in not_this not_car not_front not_or not_back not_seat
Neg,You tighten it it loosens It does magnificent in the snow Is very roomy The back seat is a little awkward to get into I bought this 1991 Ford Van to fit my family of 6 into I loved it at first It is very easy to drive and seems to be pretty powerful Gets decent mileage around 22 miles a gallon It has never left me on the side of the road And it has tons of space to take everything that everyone wants to bring There is also a stationary seatbelt in the middle seat which has injured several people getting into the van When I replaced the wiper motor I noticed the one I took out was a refurbed one which meant this was the third possible wiper motor on this car Otherwise it has been great it totes the whole lot of us around safely Then things began to go wrong I have owned it for 6 months and in that time the starter the wiper motor and heater have gone out I am also experiencing some larger engine troubles but I realize that mine was probably the product of someone before me not not_taking not_very not_great not_care not_of not_it not_Besides not_the not_obvious not_mechanical not_problems not_nearly not_every not_screw not_has not_backed not_out not_and not_everything not_wiggles not_and not_giggles not_and not_rattles

Neg,Thats a lot of money He was just starting his career at that time My husband purchased a 1992 Ford Probe used in 1997 The final straw came when the drivers side window broke There were problems from the start of his even considering this car He got a pretty decent loan from Ford Credit Company and was paying about 200 month We pawned it off on an unsuspecting Saturn dealership in Tucson who over valued the car On the lot there was a newer model Ford Probe with less miles Obviously it cost more Well my husband really liked this car It already had 100 000 miles on it Unfortunately my husband was blinded by the sporty car that he could actually afford It wouldnt not_roll not_up not_all not_the not_way not_The not_estimated not_cost not_to not_repair not_it not_was not_over not_500 Immediately we started looking for another car The salesman got him really interested in that car and offered for him to drive it off the lot on Saturday night and come back Monday to work out specifics Thankfully my husband did not not_take not_up not_that not_offer not_I not_should not_also not_mention not_my not_husband not_was not_in not_a not_hurry not_to not_get not_a not_car not_because not_his not_car not_had not_been not_stolen We wont be buying any Ford cars in the future Please see my response to the excuses of why the problems of this car should have been expected in the comments section When he returned to the dealership the following Monday the same salesman told him that he couldnt afford the newer Probe and had no memory of even offering it Since my husband had gotten his heart set on this car he settled for the older Probe He paid the blue book value for the car Within 2 months things were going wrong Within 5 months it became obvious that the previous owner had worked on the car creating several problems Besides the regular payment the Probe was costing about 1000 in repairs every 3 months Even though the car was sold qualifying under the lemon law by the time there was enough problems to take action the dealership was under new management and they supposedly could not not_do not_anything not_Ford not_was not_contacted but by the time they responded the dealership had dissolved They told us they would auction it off for parts so we didnt not_feel not_so not_bad not_We not_were not_never not_happier not_to not_get not_rid not_of not_a not_car not_We not_cannot not_recommend not_a not_Ford not_Probe not_to not_anybody not_especially not_because not_the not_Probe not_model not_has not_been not_discontinued not_and not_you not_can not_only not_purchase not_it not_used not_at not_this not_time not_Our not_treatment not_from not_Ford not_was not_also not_very not_poor

Neg,This estimate is the average from 3 body shops One gust of wind and I am blown all over the road I recently had a blow out going about 55 mph on the highway These cars are not not_made not_well not_I not_would not_not not_call not_them not_safe not_cars not_because not_of not_the not_amount not_of not_damage not_I not_sustained not_from not_such not_a not_seemingly not_simple not_fender not_bender When the blow out of my tire occurred I really did not not_realize not_how not_much not_damage not_the not_little not_bang not_had not_done not_until not_I not_tried not_to not_change not_the not_damaged not_tire The driving conditions were ideal but I my car was thrown into the side railing of a bridge and the damage accrued from this simple blow out is going to be about 2000 dollars I currently own an Aspire and there are some good things about it and some bad things about it One of the great things about this car is the mileage I can fill it up and it will go forever However this car really does not not_handle not_well
Neg,The other two models have an SPI engine with only 110 horsepower Others are more economical and can really help stretch your fuel dollars to the fullest But the overall cost is still low when compared to the average vehicle Final Thoughts The 2003 Ford Focus Sedan is a simple vehicle with a few nice features combined with some real annoyances Some are large and heavy and drain the gasoline faster than a reservoir following a dam burst Of the three sedan trim levels the ZTS is a little more sporty and it offers the most options Ford Motor Company makes many vehicles in all sorts of sizes to accommodate the needs of its customers The 110 horsepower engine in the LX and SE trim levels operates with a single overhead cam and two valves per cylinder This is a safety reminder that is becoming more and more common in newer models of cars This is due to the somewhat larger more powerful engine in the ZTS a 2 0 liter Zetec engine with 130 horsepower All three models are available only with 4 cylinder engines Price Ford Focus will appeal to many people for one simple reason the low price For myself I will stick with the more enjoyable vehicles that cost a little more and guzzle a little more gas The price is low too and the smaller engine equates to greater fuel efficiency Cargo space is also very good with the Ford Focus The trunk contains about 13 8 cubic feet of usable storage area and this can be increased with the fold down rear seats This review will center on the sedan style With the sedan you can choose among three different trim levels LX SE and ZTS It might free up some cash flow because the price is so low to spend on other things but the fun with Ford Focus ends right there This provides enough power for easy driving in the city but once it comes time to accelerate quickly the Focus has a difficult time gaining ground One vehicle that fits into the latter category is the 2003 Ford Focus a smaller vehicle designed with economy in mind Features Options Ford Focus comes in several different body styles Hatchback Sedan and wagon The invoice price on the three models is approx 12 400 for the LX 13 900 for the SE and 14 700 for the ZTS Adding options will of course increase the price by a couple thousand or more It beeps at you until the driver gives in and fastens the seat belt Seat belts are a good idea of course but it gets really irritating listening to that beep Another annoying sound is the turn signals Lets talk first about the good points Besides the low price this vehicle does offer a reliable responsive steering system

not_the not_wheel The large trunk was one of the first things that caught my attention when I first examined this vehicle im always looking for additional storage space and a large trunk is an important consideration when im judging the merits of a car Now lets talk about the negative aspects of the 2003 Ford Focus Sedan First of all I got really annoyed with the seat belt beeper My bottom line on this vehicle is that its a very basic simple practical car for money conscious consumers With an invoice price range from 12 400 to 14 700 14 500 to 18 750 retail the 2003 Ford Focus Sedan will likely remain a popular choice for millions of Americans who are sick and tired of flushing so many dollars down the drain to make a car payment and to pay for fuel They might cause a greater feeling of lightness in my wallet but they are also more in tune with what I want in a vehicle and what I am willing to pay for The 2003 Ford Focus Sedan is inexpensive but it fails to excite or even to satisfy Unless your funds are tight I recommend focusing on something a little more enjoyable These three trim levels are arranged in order of price and overall luxury with the LX being the most basic the ZTS the most luxurious and the SE falling somewhere in the middle of the two Each of these three trim levels seats five and comes with a standard option package that includes most of the usual bells and whistles that one expects nowadays tilt steering wheel automatic transmission manual is an option front air bags power windows and locks 3 year 36 000 mile warranty CD player etc This is especially true when the air conditioner is running I often found that to pick up sufficient speed when entering the ramp of an interstate highway I was forced to temporarily turn the a c off im afraid that 110 horsepower just doesnt cut it when it comes to quick get up and go The ZTS trim has a little more power 130 horsepower but not not_by not_much I didnt not_drive not_the not_ZTS but I doubt that the additional power of 20 horses would make a significant difference
Neg,But once I had loaded my amp a Fender Accoustisonic I was very grateful for the nice water tight windows and the heater air con Jr not not_terribly big or heavy a couple of small drums other percussion and my costumes I had to pretty much floor the gutless wonder to make the speed limit going up the Volcano Highway While the trunk CAPACITY was excellent I found the high lip on the trunk painfully inconvenient Lifting all of my gear that high was very hard on my back and shoulders I almost couldnt get the heavier stuff into the trunk and getting it back out was worse I did like how far forward the load can sit so the tail doesnt overload and lighten the front end On the return home making the downhill run the car had no problems staying with traffic and handled quite well Nice and tight steering excellent cornering capability comfy seating At 5 3 tall when I stand up reeeeeaaaaalllly straight I found the leg and head room to be fine I did bump my head once when I was squirming around trying to adjust the seat so my 6 Sweetheart may not not_have not_been not_as not_comfy This made me really wonder what it would have been like with four adults sitting in it No idea what kind of engine was in it but whatever it was the exercise wheel could have used an extra mouse or even an upgrade to a mouse or a gerbil Perhaps adding a rubber band auxiliary engine would have helped Hmmmmmm Guess I wasnt not_at not_all not_impressed not_with not_the not_powerplant not_Handling not_was not_pretty not_decent not_though I recently had to rent a car to carry a bit more stuff than I could get on the back of my bike Harper Rental in Hilo Hawai i assigned me a 2003 Ford Focus sedan with 8 365 miles on it When I rode over to pick it up and first saw the car I thought Gee Thats kinda pretty I wont mind driving that around Well it was nice in the PARKING LOT This made me think it would probably be a lousy family car unless you just tool around town and use it for grocery runs so it doesnt have to work very hard Mashing the accelerator to stay with traffic sucked the gas down so I lost any fuel savings associated with such a lightweight car Acceleration was sluggish so I was unable to pass any of the heavy equipment or horse trailers which were averaging about 50 mph
Neg,MY EXPERIENCE The Focus fares much better in this area I test drove a 2003 Focus LX sedan at a local dealership The Focus has many strengths but straight line stomping is not not_among not_them The Focuss interior isnt not_perfect but it competes very well with the best in class My test drive lasted about half an hour and consisted of winding secondary roads and the freeway PERFORMANCE The Focus transmission shifted well enough but lacked a precise mechanical feel that would have made it fun As mentioned before the engine isnt not_all not_that not_quiet but road and wind noise are pleasantly muted INTERIOR The steering feels just a touch squirmy on center but is otherwise second only to the Mazda3s for feel and precision To be fair this relative lethargy is less pronounced in other Focus trims that arent all that much more expensive For example the SE gets a 130 horsepower engine along with a CD player and other useful niceties for a little over 1 500 more There has been a good deal of griping about the Focuss front seats in the automotive press but I found them plenty comfortable during my test drive Ah heres the rub The Focus is quite a good little car but according to Consumer Reports its reliability is Much Worse Than Average a fairly scathing criticism There were only two notable caveats in the Focuss cabin One was the materials which were predominantly cheap hard plastic detracting from the sense of quality And while the high upright driving position wasnt not_to not_my not_liking not_I not_can not_imagine not_many not_buyers would love the commanding minivan like view of the road it provides While I havent driven either of these models their behavior should be identical to that of the sedans while adding a measure of cargo hauling ability and uniqueness RELIABILITY The trunk is also quite spacious for a small car and a standard split folding rear seat makes it all the more flexible For further utility buyers can choose from a five door hatchback style the ZX5 or a conventional station wagon That trims the 0 60 time down to a more reasonable 9 5 seconds or so and although I havent driven a Focus with this engine its likely to add a measure of confidence in freeway merging that the LX model was short on TRANSMISSION CLUTCH There was also an unusual amount of road feel coursing through the wheelrim an unusual quality in a low priced car and one that allowed me to intuitively judge how much grip was left when I was driving hard on a twisty road And while this is purely anecdotal evidence and far from conclusive one of my friends who bought a Focus recently would certainly agree with CRs findings his water pump broke twice in one week stranding him out of town for days OVERALL The Focuss soft suspension allowed quite a lot of body lean in hard turns which was unsettling at first but once I learned to trust the Focuss chassis I found it a capable handler with plenty of grip in reserve on winding roads As good as this car is there are others like the Civic and Corolla that drive just as nicely and arent nearly as likely to give you problems A new car should give its driver total peace of mind and thats something the Focus may not not_be not_able not_to not_deliver So frustrating I really liked this car in nearly every respect and yet I cant not_give not_it not_my not_recommendation not_Although not_its not_a not_fresh not_modern not_design not_and not_its not_road not_manners not_are not_fun and engaging its very poor repair record was more than enough to temper my enthusiasm and I simply cant not_give not_the not_Focus not_the not_nod not_with not_a not_clear not_conscience The other was the distracting styling of the dashboard where numerous slashing curves and unusual angles competed with the road for my attention during my test drive PRACTICALITY ive already mentioned the expansive interior but its worth mentioning again as it adds a considerable measure of practicality to the Focus from the inside it feels like a much bigger car Its road manners have a distinctly European feel to them which comes as no surprise when you consider that the Focus was designed in part by Ford of England with the European market in mind Its steering was firmly weighted and responded quickly with a solid decisive feel that inspired great confidence on twisting roads The shifter finds the gears accurately I never missed a shift but it has long throws and its action feels mushy Similarly the clutch engaged very smoothly making it nearly impossible to jerk the car during gearchanges but it had a long throw and engaged way up at the top of the pedal travel which made for lots of left leg aerobics when driving around town STEERING HANDLING There was a surprising amount of room inside both front and rear and space was especially generous overhead it felt like I could have worn a ten gallon hat while seated if I was for some reason possessed to do so All the Focuss controls were easy to see and use and while they didnt not_operate not_with not_the not_well not_oiled not_silkiness not_of not_the not_Corollas not_or not_Civics not_controls not_they not_were not_easily not_superior not_to not_the not_crackly not_switchgear not_in not_other not_domestic not_alternatives not_like not_the not_Chevy not_Cavalier not_and not_Dodge not_Neon Two thumbs up for European driving priorities and their positive effect on the Focuss excellent dynamic qualities RIDE Another impressive quality of the Focus is how well it rides Usually agile handling cars make some noticeable sacrifice in ride comfort due to their stiff suspensions but not not_the not_Focus not_Its not_ride not_is not_quite not_soft not_and not_absorbent not_soaking not_up not_bumps not_and not_ruts not_quietly and without harshness Damping is a bit on the soft side meaning that the car bobbles over dips and humps in the road but most of the time it simply swallows the bumps without disturbing passengers The engine in the LX model that I drove was among the weakest in the budget sedan brigade putting out just 110 horsepower Although acceleration felt adequate around town the Focus felt decidedly flat footed on freeway on ramps even when I wasnt not_pushing not_it not_When not_I not_floored not_the not_throttle not_for not_maximum not_acceleration not_the not_sensation not_was not_akin not_to not_driving not_through not_deep not_sand and the engine wasnt not_very not_quiet not_about not_it either Most car magazines have quoted the LXs 0 60 times around 11 seconds which isnt not_awful but places it among the slowest brand new cars
Neg,This car has the problems I own a 2000 Eddie Bauer Explorer The rear windshield wiper would not not_work not_properly Whats worse is dealing with Ford and their dealers The car is nice has all the whistles and bells that someone could want and it rides decently In fact I would say they have the best trained customer service departments I have seen anywhere It has been in the shop for at least 2 months of ownership Little stuff big stuff it doesnt matter But within the first year of ownership I have had numerous little problems that have turned out to be major inconveniences The door locks didnt not_work not_Warning not_lights not_come not_on not_for not_no not_reason and the dealer has to this day been unable to find the cause Oh they do an absolutely great job with customer service always promising that they will do whatever they can apologizing for all the frustration etc However its one thing to be nice and say all the right things on the phone but its another thing to be able to actually resolve the problem Their cars have so many little things that go wrong and its surprising how ineffective they are in fixing them I would estimate that in the first year of ownership I have actually only had the car 10 months

Neg,The Ford Econoline van was not not_only a mechanics worst nightmare but also the owners This van had numerous problems including severe break problems and an overall rough ride from light suspension The ride was horrible it got about ten miles to the gallon on gas and used up your money in many other ways So if your looking for a van out there I believe that you should shop around some more and definatly not not_look not_in not_to not_the not_Ford not_Econoline not_van not_unless not_your not_up not_for not_a not_rough not_ride not_and not_spending not_money not_on not_brakes not_every not_four not_months not_I not_really not_do not_not not_recommend not_this not_van not_to not_anyone The brakes had to be replaced at least every four months and the suspension seamed to always bottom out and not not_provide not_enough not_suspension not_for not_even not_the not_regular not_trip not_around not_town not_Sure not_this not_van not_was not_nice not_for not_carrying not_people not_and not_cargo but mechanical problems put this van on the bottom of my list
Neg,My 1996 It accelerates quickly and handles very responsively The strangest thing about the Probe are the windows My chief complaint about the ride is the noise The material and workmanship of the interior seems top notch My car was broken into and cleaned out much to my dismay It is versatile for a sports car since it is a hatchback The car is a front wheel drive and handles very well in the winter The automatic transmission makes for quick starts and the shifting has a sporty feel It even had a small rear spoiler which added to the sportiness As mentioned before the windows are sealed with rubber molding but no frame The gift would have cost me almost as much as the original amount paid In the end I decided to donate the car to charity and bought myself another car It looks cool and its so much fun to drive Even the automatic has power galore There is no frame around the windows and the doors are sealed with a rubber molding around the door frame The interior looks great and the seats are similar to the bucket seats you see in many sports cars All it takes is prying the window slightly and then using a wire hanger to unlock the door The problem with this is that it makes it noisy outside wind is easily heard and easy to break into It allows you to fit a lot of things inside although the sporty styling means less vertical space for transport Ride At times the ride can be a little rough especially when going over bumps and potholes but overall it handles like a dream Probe SE was a gift to me and the buyer got a great deal on it at least thats what I thought at first Appearance This car is great for people that dont not_mind not_frequent not_repairs not_or not_those not_who not_are not_car not_enthusiasts not_who not_can not_do not_their not_own not_repair not_work The shape of the Probe makes its length a little longer than I tend to like Its difficult to park the car a lot of the time This means that wind noise can be heard through the window and rain can easily leak in Sometimes in fact the window would roll down on its own The engine also rattles and squeaks a lot Reliability Here is the Probes weakest point reliability About two days after I got the Probe the engine stalled while I was in Chicago traffic The Probe is a great looking car Some say it looks like an artificial sports car but with the sleek styling and flip up headlights its got a very sporty look The RPMs will run high then quickly shift to give the quickest acceleration Despite the fast acceleration it gets great gas mileage I usually got 30 or more miles per gallon on the highway The rear seats are not not_roomy and passengers in the back seat will often bump their heads on the rear window Features My Probe SE had some great features including excellent A C great pick up and handling and a decent sound system In 4 months the check engine light went on for the 3rd time I was told that the car needed a new catalytic converter just replaced a year before new oxygen sensors just replaced 4 months before and electrical work all which would add up to 1800 It started again but then after I stopped for gas I couldnt get it started After having it towed I found out it was a bad connection between the battery and the engine and cost 30 to fix Little did I know that repairs were going to be much much more expensive later on During the two years I owned the car I had to replace the oxygen sensors twice 700 each time this happened I had to replace the catalytic converter 800 with installation and have minor work on the transmission about 350 After I had given up a few limbs to pay for repairs and had complete preventative maintenance done on it I figured it would run for a while with no problems
Neg,The tires were shot around 30 000 miles I purchased a 1996 Ford Probe in May of 1997 After only a month the A C went out And in Texas summers an A C is a given It was my first new car purchase ever I thought I had the perfect car WRONG It was brand new with only 15 miles on it when we got it Very clean very sporty And that will be a normal cost for about every 30 000 miles after that Stay away from this and any other Ford if you can The fixed the problem and we were on our way A month went by and the same thing happened again Again we got it fixed This continued to happen at least 4 times over the next year or so On top of the A C problems the brakes wore out after 25 000 miles We took it in and discovered that our dealer wouldnt not_give not_us not_a not_loaner not_even not_though not_it not_was not_only not_a not_month not_old not_Eventually not_I not_got not_one not_anyway The seats tore up And the gas mileage was so so When you drive down the rode it seems as if you are in a wind tunnel or something And when it rained outside it usually rained in on us Needless to say after about 60 000 miles we traded it in just as the transmission was fixing to go out on it By the way to get a transmission fixed you have to fork out about 2500 bucks
Neg,It idles pretty loudly In this case its the Ford F 250 The diesel engine is a little more thriftier This engine serves only 2 purposes Towing and fuel economy There are gasoline engines available but gas mileage with those engines are horrible The optional Reverse Sensing System helps a lot because usually the bigger the car err SUV the bigger the blind spots As far as styling goes I would call it functional but nothing more INTERIOR The wide seats are very accommodating Power adjustable pedals are a nice feature but im a rather tall driver and thus have no use for them The 7 3 liter POWERSTROKE turbocharged V8 diesel engine produces 250 horsepower at 2 600 rpm and a substantial 505 lb ft of torque at an extremely low 1 600 rpm This may sound like a lot of power but in my opinion the 7 250 pound SUV NEEDS that kind torque just get moving To me an SUV of this size should only be used for towing or hauling However luxury options such as leather upholstery an entertainment system a CD changer and even automatic climate control is either standard or optional depending on the model ENGINE The Ford Excursion is the largest sport utility vehicle on the market I would only recommend this vehicle if you REALLY need to tow 11 000 pounds EXTERIOR Like some SUVs on the market the Excursion is based on a pickup truck This is the Excursions weakest point due to its size Its very ponderous on twisty roads and has a huge turning circle Getting in and out of parking spaces is like a chore to me im surprised there is even a limo version of the Excursion The diesel is more expensive to buy than the gasoline engines so take it for a test drive before you decide to buy one All engines use the same 4 speed automatic transmission I averaged 17 7 mpg in a mix of city and highway driving HANDLING There is a lot of head and leg room all throughout the front and 2nd row seats even for me Although the Excursion is not not_very not_aerodynamic not_I not_feel not_it not_does not_a not_good not_job not_of not_keeping not_wind not_noise not_down not_to not_a not_minimum not_not not_like not_a not_Lexus not_though not_My not_test not_car not_has not_the not_diesel not_engine The brakes feel strong but it takes a bit longer to stop from speed than other lighter im talking 5 000 pounds sport utility vehicles RIDE Small bumps are easily absorbed due to the 137 inch long wheelbase Hitting larger bumps to me can get annoying at times Despite being so large the Excursion feels very stable in a straight line RELIABILITY Although nothing too serious has happened for a while I was hearing a popping noise coming from under the floorboard I have yet to figure out what it is but I will update this review as soon as possible VALUE Despite its drawbacks the Excursion is a fairly good value assuming you need the towing capacity or room for 9
Neg,You may ask My answer I did twice My wife and I lease a 1997 FORD RANGER XLT They work for a couple weeks or even a month In Ohio the highways and biways are constantly cracking and getting potholes in them Why didnt not_you not_take not_it not_to not_the not_shop not_to not_get not_it not_fixed I wasnt not_going not_to not_mention not_the not_fact not_that not_the not_WASHER not_FLUID not_dispensers not_dont not_work not_either She absolutely LOVES it but I wish I could drive it off a cliff The bumps on the roadways are enough to make an airsick person want to fly to get around This is because the rear window does not not_extend not_far not_enough not_to not_the not_side not_of not_the not_truck not_to not_increase not_the not_peripheral not_vision Any vehicle that fish tails when it hits a little bump in the road while going around a gentle curve IS NOT SAFE Then it starts happening again Well my wife loves it Thats why we still have it in the driveway Next February when the lease has expired its Bye Bye Ranger Then after I turn them off I ll be driving down the road a little way and the HIGH SPEED wipers will just start going AND I CAnt STOP THEM When we purchased the truck in February 1997 it was a very sturdy truck with power and comfort all together However after only 50 000 miles it feels like its falling apart at the seams My wife gets studs put on the rear tires for winter driving but we have to put 8 10 bags of sand in the bed of the truck for the studs to make any difference whatsoever The electrical system shorted out after only 1 year of driving it For instance if I want to turn the wipers on I turn the knob but have to wait for about 3 4 minutes for them to kick in What has happened over the past few years with this truck is that the suspension is not not_shot not_the not_steering not_is not_over not_sensitive not_it not_seems not_lighter not_around not_corners not_and not_all not_in not_all not_it not_makes not_me not_very not_uncomfortable not_driving not_it not_around We did not not_get not_an not_extended not_cab not_so not_needless not_to not_say not_the not_seats not_arent not_as not_comfortable not_as not_possible not_However not_FORD not_puts not_the not_seats not_so not_high not_up not_in not_the not_cab not_that not_the not_roof not_seems not_too not_short not_I not_am not_only not_5 not_9 not_and not_I not_feel not_like not_I not_have not_to not_slouch not_to not_keep not_from not_hitting not_the not_ceiling not_The not_blind not_side not_is not_HUGE
Neg,The gears are very tall Unless you ve got a good 150 yard headstart My two major gripes are the cabspace and lack of acceleration I bought my 97 Ranger in 2000 and must say that overall it has been a good vehicle On a short trip 10 Min the Truck is fine after that you ll start squirming and trying to stretch your legs if 6 tall or more Want to try and merge onto the freeway DOnt EVEN THINK ABOUT IT COWBOY One minor gripe is the 2 spark plugs per cylinder twice as expensive for tune ups due to double plugs and wires Another gripe are the electrical problems Ford is infamous for its Check Engine Light Mine came on twice since I owned the truck Only one time did it cost me Highlights are Price affordable Utility move stuff fridges kegs sofas Durability fairly low maintenance
Neg,I bought a 1997 Ford Ranger to make a 6 500 mile trip from Alaska to the East Coast I had made the same trip two years before with an 1987 Chevy S10 I got much worse gas mileage on a the Ford which was 10 years newer Also the Ford would not not_handle not_the not_same not_mountains not_that not_my not_S10 not_had not_no not_problems not_conquering not_I not_have not_not not_enjoyed not_my not_Ranger not_because not_my not_Chevy not_ran not_and not_handled not_much not_better not_and not_was not_10 not_years not_older not_I not_will not_never not_buy not_a not_Ford not_again not_I not_recommend not_Chevy not_S10 not_for not_peace not_of not_mind not_on not_a not_long not_hard not_journey

Neg,It also got excellent gas mileage But man what an ugly car The only good thing about this car was that it did have air conditioning and a tape player I had this car given to me as a rental from Enterprise I had for one day because that was as long as I could deal with having it im used to cars that have a little up and go So when I drove this car I was fairly upset with it I went and a trip to another city which was about 90 miles away and it was the worst trip I had ever made A diesel drove past me and I almost got sucked into it It was awkward to drive and man was it ugly
Neg,Also the CD changer installed in the console only works sporadically The check engine light came on which caused me to replace multiple sensors It continued to glow then one day it began flashing then went off It has become unreliable and I have been advised by 3 repairmen to trade it soon At 37 500 miles just after the warranty expired the switch on the automatic seat broke and a week later the metal lever that controls the back of the seat literally broke in two Next I noticed a shaking sensation when braking replaced the brakes but the problem remains I looked at all the other SUVs and chose a 1997 Ford Explorer XTL for the roomy and comfortable interior Until approximately 24 000 miles my only trips to the shop were for oil changes but problems have steadily come sice then First came a problem with the accelerator sticking the dealer said that nothing was wrong but 6 months later Ford had a recall When I took it to the dealer while the warranty was still in they stated there was nothing wrong A clicking sound on the right side started somewhere around 38 000 miles Later I noticed that my engine wasnt not_running not_smoothly not_my not_Explorer not_was not_hard not_to not_crank and it frequently chokes down I have taken it to several mechanics to attempt repairs but all of them have concluded that there is a crack in the intake manifold a major repair that has to be done by the dealer
Neg,We got the two door We purchased a used 96 Ford Aspire Thats wonderful unless you have children The original owners got smart and bought something else That was difficult very difficult but finally accomplished It looked great For a small car its even roomy The brakes make up for that They are super touchy You have to put a little muscle into turning the wheel Although it is a funny image of course thats not not_safe not_or not_legal The seats do fold down in the back to make more room That was until I tried to fit a standard sized folded playpen into the back My husband drives this car the most and my older beat up car is my preference compared It sure isnt not_child not_friendly not_for not_parents not_I not_thought not_the not_hatchback not_would not_be not_nice not_with not_children There is plenty of foot and leg room for such a small car but they sure didnt not_make not_the not_back not_storage not_area not_roomy There are only four seat belts in this car Unlike most cars there are only two seat belts in the back instead of three This car would be great for a grandmother or your average run of the mill Sunday driver Its slow Obviously you need to not not_have not_small not_children not_with not_this not_car The Aspire might have air conditioning and a better stereo than my old Tempo but having to drive the Aspire just isnt not_worth not_the not_luxury not_of not_air not_and not_better not_speakers If you arent very light on the foot you will get to meet the dash in a sudden fashion I notice they tend to lock easily Why they didnt not_put not_one not_where not_there not_is not_obvious not_space not_for not_one is a mystery I get a work out just driving the car Power steering my foot In other words if you need more room in the car to fit something in the back I suppose you could strap the kids to the top of the car in their car seats LOL This car is great on mileage Its about the only plus to it Its got no get up and go My 86 Ford Tempo which is ten years older has more pick up and go than the Aspire You can put your foot to the floor on the gas but you ll find yourself saying a prayer when you try to merge on a Freeway that you dont not_get not_hit because it takes you forever to reach traffic speed What was Ford thinking when they made this car Obviously they werent thinking about families children or their needs I have dubbed the Aspire the new and improved version of the Pinto I now know why there are so many used Aspires for sale What a mistake Its family unfriendly if you have small children in car seats Getting small children in and out of the back is a pure nightmare in the making You have to actually climb into the back seat to get them out Its even tough to fit the carseat through the room you have between pushing the seat all the way up You obviously cant not_put not_them not_in not_the not_front not_because not_of not_the not_air not_bags
Neg,Ok The price was affordable It didnt not_work not_very not_well The glove box is an actual glove box There just isnt not_any not_power not_in not_this not_baby The alarm shut off so the car started again She felt it was too hard to steer Mine was one of the better models made I had air conditioning It was cheaper than paying for a new joint and boot which was the problem You can barely put some weight on the brakes and they tend to almost lock up While driving in the desert I noticed that the car doesnt do well in extreme heat either The ashtray fell out or jammed up when I tried to use it for a change tray The alarm didnt not_even not_go not_off not_when not_I not_tried not_to not_start not_it not_The not_system not_worked not_fine not_that not_way One day my battery for my remote died and I could get into the car but I couldnt get it started Id save a lot on gas money Reason one to hate this car is that it is small When AAA showed up the guy just shook his head at me popped open a panel under the dash and pushed a button While the seats in the back fold down to make more room if you want to carry something large there really isnt not_that not_much not_space not_in not_the not_back The car wouldnt not_start not_I not_had not_to not_call not_AAA not_thinking not_Id not_just not_have not_it not_towed not_home not_borrow not_the not_wifes not_alarm not_remote not_and not_go not_replace not_the not_battery not_in not_mine It matched my budget on payments I thought it was kind of small but since I drive a lot I didnt not_mind because I knew It depended on the light outside or lack of I should have been warned right there that maybe this car wasnt not_one not_to not_buy not_Even not_the not_dealership not_couldnt not_name not_that not_color This you can adjust to which I did but I wasnt not_real not_happy not_about not_it not_The not_steering not_I not_also not_got not_used not_to but my wife refused to drive my car after a few times The third time I had to take it in was because while driving on the freeway I could hear a bad noise coming from the wheel well on the passenger side I had to replace the front axal It sure hurt me realizing exactly how much having that piece of junk for a year had cost me after they deducted what Id paid on it to that point deducting the trade in value and adding that remaining balance to my replacement car It was the kind that locks the ignition so no one can drive away with it if they break into it The alarm was a real piece of junk Someone could smash a window steal everything in the car and it wouldnt not_set not_the not_alarm not_off When I did try to buy one and have it installed the people just shook their heads at me and explained that they would have to do a lot of work to remove the factory installed unit and get a new system in This adds to your normal bill So my title is sort of a rip off from a funny movie but when I think about the Ford Aspire I had that title is stuck in my head I bought a 1996 Ford Aspire I still cant not_tell not_you not_the not_exact not_color not_of not_it not_It not_was not_a not_purple not_blue Thats about all that you can fit into the tiny thing A pair of gloves I wanted to upgrade the stereo system but realized that again they had really made this car compact I had a hard time finding a unit that would fit in the very small space provided All anyone ever had to do was break a window pop that panel to push a little button rip out the ignition and take off with my car in less than a minute I was a bit furious over this fact Reason number eight to hate this car is that it only comes with two seat belts in the back seat It doesnt bother you at first but after an hour you start to feel it in your back and behind side Reason number five to hate this car is while traveling you really notice the flaws about this car While driving in the mountains you are going to experience power loss on the way up Traffic will start passing you by even though you have your foot to the floor You can put your foot to the floor trying to merge with traffic going over fifty miles and hour and still not not_reach not_that not_speed not_at not_a not_decent not_pace ive almost been in accidents because of this The car just has no get up and go Reason number three to hate this car is the wheel is hard to turn when you are doing U turns yet the brakes are super touchy The fourth time I had to take it in was because there was something wrong with the transmission I could feel it slipping Reason number seven to hate this car was paying the huge bill that came with all four of those repair bills Reason number seven to hate this car and I blame this one one the dealership I bought it from was the alarm that came with it It was a cheap alarm system There is room for a third one but Ford must have really wanted to cut corners when they made it There is about fourteen inches of space in the middle of the backseat that is totally a waste of space in that regard Would it have killed them to put in a middle seat belt I guess so They sure didnt not_do not_it not_Reason not_number not_nine not_is not_the not_total not_lack not_of not_comfort not_the not_car not_has not_and not_functions Also we had problems shutting the hatch back Sometimes it didnt not_want not_to not_shut not_Sometimes not_when not_I not_hit not_a not_dip

not_Its not_when not_you not_get not_on not_a not_highway not_or not_freeway not_that not_you not_notice They assured me that the wiring was a nightmare as well Reason number ten is looking back at the other nine reasons and knowing that I paid too much money for this car regretting buying it in the first place and having to go out to find another car I no longer have the Aspire I couldnt wait to be rid of it after having it for just over a year I also want to mention that the trade in value of the car is painful While some might think the wife not not_wanting not_to not_drive not_their not_car is a reason to buy it remember reason one and two Reason number four to hate this car is that when you travel any distance in it the car seems to shrink on you While you might frown about this because we all know cars dont not_really not_shrink not_I not_know not_that not_it not_feels not_like not_it not_is not_After not_an not_hour not_or not_so not_on not_the not_road not_you not_realize

Neg,The first time at 32 k Although my 1996 automatic Aspire runs well has decent pickup for a smaller car and gets great gas mileage I have been unfortunate to have had to replace the transmission 2 times and the transmission just went out again so will be a 3rd time Ford honored the warranty but the second time even though it only had 22 k on the transmission there was 54 k on the engine so would not not_honor not_the not_original not_rebuilt not_or not_the not_extended not_warranty not_purchased not_with not_the not_car not_As not_the not_transmission not_was not_rebuilt not_by not_a not_third not_party not_this not_last not_time not_they not_are not_going not_to not_honor not_their not_work not_and not_cover not_the not_transmission but if left up to Ford I would have to pay again so this economy car is costing more than that
Neg,So they had replaced the cables replaced the brake pads and machined the rotors due to wear They had told me the parking brake cables were sticking and had worn out the rear break pads I had purchased a 1997 contour sport new from a Dealership expecting it to be a good trouble free family car All they could tell me is its out of warranty and your going to have to pay for the parts and labor The car wouldnt not_come not_out not_of not_park not_until not_you not_messed not_with not_it not_for not_about not_ten not_minutes not_I not_called not_the not_dealership not_and not_asked not_for not_the not_service not_manager not_and not_told not_him not_what not_I not_was not_experiencing not_now not_I not_didnt not_get not_anywhere not_with not_him not_I not_finally not_had not_it not_and not_put not_the not_car not_up not_for not_sale not_and not_will not_NEVER not_buy not_another not_ford Thats when I blew up and told them all the problems I had with this NEW car they didnt not_seem not_to not_care so I hung up and went to the dealership and wasted my time arguing about it I left with the problem still needing attention About a month later I had another problem with the car The day after I bought it I had found the spare wheel and jack missing The Dealership had taken one out of another contour A few months later when the rain started coming down I found that I had two inches of rain in the trunk I took to the dealership and a week later in the shop they had fixed the leaks About a month later the brakes started squeaking when backing up it was loud The noise had stopped and the car ran good until the check engine light came on I took it back to the dealership and they hooked it up to the diagnostic and found all kinds of problems with it So they put me in a rental car until they can get the parts they needed to fix it The car was under warranty so nothing came out of my pocket and the people were nice About twenty miles over my warranty my coolant light came on I checked the coolant and it was at its normal level I called the dealership and told them the problem and they said it was probably a faulty switch and the warranty had expired I told them all the troubles I had with it but they didnt not_seem not_to not_care not_A not_week not_later not_my not_brakes not_did not_the not_same not_thing not_when not_I not_had not_bought not_it not_new not_I not_called not_the not_dealership not_and not_told not_them not_the not_problem not_had not_not not_been not_fixed not_since not_this not_was not_the not_same not_thing not_that not_happened not_the not_first not_time
Neg,If only looks were everything The car often stalls out after its first started The engine is noisy in most situations other than cruising at a steady speed and the car could use a little more power When I factored in all the considerations I decided to stick with the Contour nonetheless I do still like the car The car has been driven on the highway most of its life and it already feels like it could use a whole new suspension under some circumstances If we had bought a Honda Subaru Toyota or Nissan even if it would have had a few more miles on it I would probably be writing a more positive review now The worst of the bad news about this car is that although it is only going on 4 years old it feels like its going on 10 years old The biggest reasons are the comfort of the car in general the mid range size of the car that wasnt not_easy not_to not_find not_in not_other not_models not_the not_seats not_the not_fuel not_economy not_and not_the not_way not_it not_looks If you own one of these and you havent had trouble with the brakes yet you are very lucky Ours needs 4 new rotors because it vibrates or shimmies when it comes to a stop most of the time Thank goodness I cant not_think not_of not_much not_to not_say not_about not_the not_transmission not_although not_its not_nothing not_to not_rave not_about not_Looking not_back not_on not_it not_although not_we not_certainly not_could not_have not_done not_worse not_than not_we not_did not_we not_wish not_we not_hadnt not_been not_so not_patriotic Last year my wife needed a newer car than the 85 Buick she was driving I had read reviews and information about the Contour touting it as a pretty good all around car I was worried about crash worthiness though If I remember correctly the Contour doesnt usually score well in all areas of crash protection It hasnt quite gone over 80 000 miles yet but you d think it had gone way past Further we have just started experimenting with putting a car seat in the back for our baby and it doesnt look like its going to be a good fit Also if you need the rear seatback to fold down at least on this non sport model you cant not_I not_agree not_with not_any not_of not_the not_professional not_consumer not_mags not_out not_there not_that not_say not_body not_integrity not_is not_poor not_Also not_mechanically not_for not_the not_most not_part not_we not_dont not_have not_much not_confidence
Neg,But if you can get a quite one then you will love to drive this car everywhere I originally bought my 1997 with 25 000 miles Contour because it looked real nice and it was very comfortable About a year or so later I started getting noises from the dash center console and some near the rear window I have always loved Ford and have always bought exclusively from them but this car has irritated me with its creaks and clicks After having it for over a year I am trying to trade it in but the lots are starting to get an inventory of the 97 and earlier Driving the car I must admit is very fun the handling is superb and with only a 4 cylinder engine it is pretty quick Everything is real responsive I am not not_sure not_about not_the not_later not_models but this one is a curse to all who hate noises as they drive
Neg,The manual transmission is very slow and the low end torque is minimal Thought I got a good deal I was wrong Bought a 1997 Contour Sport V6 5 speed with 58 000 miles on the odometer in 2000 Do you think a Honda or Toyota would require repairs like this at 83 000 miles Found On Road Dead is not not_such not_a not_bad not_acronym This car only had 83 000 miles on it when I got rid of it yet the resale value was terrible and just about everything on the car had failed This car may seem like a bargain when you first look at it but look a little deeper Mine needed 1800 in emissions system repairs when I traded it in and this was at 83 000 miles My opinion of this car is that it is a complete piece of junk Avoid at all costs spend some extra money and buy a Honda or Toyota The Contour V6 is fun to drive when it runs properly but is it not not_nearly not_as not_quick as advertised the 170 hp V6 seems pretty weak This car came completely loaded power everything leather interior fog lights etc Unfortunately this car proved to be about as reliable as your average Yugo I had this car for all of 25 000 miles yet I had to replace the water pump twice the fuel pump the rear main seal on the engine a 1 000 repair and I sold it when it needed an 1800 emissions system repair
Neg,The four cylinder engine needs a lighter car to pull around than its assigned mid sized Contour chassis But sometimes love just isnt not_enough not_especially not_when not_it not_is not_so not_confined not_to not_the not_cornering not_ability not_of not_my not_modified not_car The SVT would have better suited me but it was too much money for my budget and still carried over the same cheap looking interior The light is annoying in its frequency of attack and it has been reset two dozen times already as technicians have tried to fix re occurring problems by replacing one part at a time There is no cheaper car on the road that can handle corners better than my Contour and that helps keep my wallet open and me under the car or visiting my dealer This is probably a dangerous time to write a review since my check engine light just came on again but I have finally been provoked to dole out some public disdain for the current sedan offerings from Ford especially after a recent spike in expensive repairs on my Torridor Red Ford Contour GL The brakes are disc drum and fade at the hint of being used for spirited driving which isnt not_too not_much not_of not_a not_concern not_unless not_going not_down not_hill not_because not_they not_usually not_cool not_off not_by not_the not_time not_the not_under not_powered not_engine not_can not_get not_the not_car not_to not_the not_next not_corner not_that not_requires not_braking not_I not_am not_out not_accelerated not_by not_everything To make matters worse it comes on and then goes out leaving me wondering if it just burned out from over use Technicians cannot not_use not_the not_computer not_to not_pinpoint not_the not_problem not_when not_the not_light not_is not_out not_because not_it not_was not_told not_to not_me not_that not_the not_error not_code not_stored not_in not_the not_computer not_goes not_away not_unless not_the not_light not_has not_been not_on not_very not_recently The short list of unscheduled maintenance and expensive repairs is as follows Manual transmission failed and was replaced with the clutch catalytic converter failed and blocked exhaust oxygen sensor wire became loose and prompted hundreds of dollars in unnecessary repair before it was found rear window rain seal has been replaced five times and keeps coming off both front wheel bearings have been worn out and replaced windshield cracked when car was washed in the sun Other annoyances include the many recalls on this vehicle the creaks and vibrations in the dash and rear side door lack of rear legroom in such a large car In search of some performance I have tried an open element air filter and Flowmaster exhaust which did help a little but were too loud for me as I reached my mid twenties Searching for a quieter upgrade I use tires that are a little bit smaller than stock to keep the revs slightly higher I contest that the real nightmare for Contour owners is not not_the not_interior not_plastics not_quality not_that not_is not_more not_of not_an not_annoyance not_and not_embarrassment not_or not_the not_adherence not_to not_the not_standard not_Ford not_recipe not_for not_another not_overweight not_under not_powered not_car not_to not_add not_to not_their not_lineup not_of not_tubby not_cars not_and not_RV not_like not_SUV not_146 not_s but the real threat is the consistent lighting of the check engine light along with other various failures that I didnt not_expect not_before not_100 not_000 not_miles This is the last Ford that I will buy because I have read too many stories reporting that these problems are not not_isolated not_to not_the not_Contour not_line and because I dislike the feeling that I have put too much money into performance products for a car that will just fall apart in the next few years I think that most of my problems occurred just after the 60 000 mile warranty had expired just as Ford marketing had planned the Contour to be removed from the US The Contour will never be a proper sports sedan as the ad campaign had suggested it would be and I only wished that I had realized this many years ago and sold it while it was worth 5000 I hope that pesky check engine light wont cost too much to get fixed this time As with many people I found the contour to be a good handling fun to drive car and it came at a price too good to pass up about 12 800 with everything a college student could use Power mirrors door locks A C an interesting but chintzy cup holder all for the aforementioned low price I purchased the Contour to complement the 1967 Mustang that I had inherited from my father thinking that it would reliably serve my needs as I commuted to College and began working after graduation Little did I anticipate that my 67 Mustang would be of so much use to me over the next five years as my only working car not not_scheduled not_for not_maintenance I have about 102 000 miles on my Contour and only keep it because I have finally set up the suspension and wheels tires just right to out corner unsuspecting BMW drivers on the 110 freeway in Los Angeles
Neg,There is no excitement whatsoever to driving this car How many recalls can a car possibly have in 3 years time In 3 years time we ve had at least 5 recalls sent to us from Ford The carpeting on the floor was fitted poorly and hangs out from the plastic molding on the edges The excitement of having a new car wore off quickly when we noticed imperfections in the design and quality of the vehicle Almost immediately our clock light burned out The cupholder a single one mind you was broken after pulling a purse off of the passenger seat It looks like a clone to many other models out there that have no major design features to make it stand out in the crowd Save your money and shop around for a better buy you ll be thankful you did We purchased a 97 Contour for use as a family car liking the fact that is was a fairly affordable buy However from the very start we ve had problems with our vehicle Upon taking it off of the lot we had the check engine light on the salesman informed us that it was a common occurrence if the gas cap isnt not_put not_on not_tightly and that it needed to go into the shop to have the switch reset
Neg,The highway ride is glassy smooth and quiet and power is typical of the Zetec engine What I say now The Contour started giving me trouble last August and hasnt stopped Then I ran across a black 97 Contour GL with 67 000 miles at the local ford dealers used lot If you keep it spinning in the mid range 3000 4500 rpm the Contour is capable of surprisingly urgent acceleration So I traded the thing in on a 2002 Mitsubishi Lancer im much happier now Review on the Lancer coming soon What I said then I have always liked the looks of the Ford Contour but I never seriously considered buying one Out of the blue the engine began to die at random intervals while driving No warning of any kind it simply shut off After much wailing and gnashing of teeth I set about looking at used sedans in the 8000 and under range I drove them all Corsicas Neons Cavaliers even an ancient Camry When my wife and I decided to cut expenses it was clear that the easiest way to do that would be to unload my beloved Ford Focus ZX3 check out my Focus reviews The dealer had the car for the better part of a month and couldnt figure it out After a while they just gave up and I have had to live with it Then the airbag light started flashing intermittently In spite of my disappointment over giving up my Focus the Contour has become an agreeable driving companion and I believe it will keep me happy until our finances stabilize and Ford brings the Focus ZX5 to the States Update January 2002 On the downside my Contour has a good deal of play in the drivetrain which makes smooth corner exits difficult and standing starts take a bit of concentration to avoid chattering the too grabby clutch I dont not_know if this is a typical Contour problem My biggest gripe with the interior is the retractable cupholder in the center console Its flimsy and too small for anything but a soda can Also its too close to the shifter and parking brake I tugged the brake handle up with the cupholder open and lost some skin off of my knuckles It had the best ride and except for the 3 1L Corsicas the most get up and go The Contour is also the least boring to look at of any car on the list I had the car in the dealers service department the first three days I owned it Minor glitches that the dealer took care of at no charge for me They replaced the rear suspension links which were making a horrible thunking noise over bumps the belt and idler pulley and adjusted the drivers door to eliminate a bit of leakage around the seal Since then the car has been smooth running and trouble free Some of the interior bits are a little loose but no more than I expect in a pre Focus Ford car All of the options and gadgets work perfectly
Neg,The handling is a joke This car is fun to drive There is an absolute lack of bass I have edited some of the content The new tires solved the wobbly turns and the shimmying steering wheel The O2 sensors needed to be replaced again At first the cars finish has held up very well My other car died and I was in a jam You can move the seats forward without using the levers This is the third time in 30 000 miles UPDATE 06 11 02 We ended up paying about 4000 and the shirts off our backs It bounces over bumps and you ll feel every one The interior has held up very well too except the front seats It has been trouble free for the past few months knock knock There is something about owning a T Bird with the 5 0 V8 engine Thats a Toyota dealership for you The speedometer only goes to 85 mph This car does handle more like a sports car now than it did There are a few specks of peeling paint on the black trim on the front bumper This car has everything power windows locks mirrors drivers seat rear defrost keyless entry and alloy wheels There are no cracks or blemishes in the entire dash board and there is no fading either Thats not not_a not_big not_deal not_though not_Speaking not_of not_broken not_the not_rear not_defrost took that path around 100 000 miles This car handles much better now so forget those negative comments I made about the handling The airconditioner needed to be recharged Figures Another 80 down the drain 120 000 miles UPDATE 01 30 02 The steering wheel likes to shimmy too Again this may fix itself when I replace the tires The rear arm rests are bulging out of their notches too and the release levers on the front seats are busted This is only visible if the doors are open and you actually look at the underside of the doors Now the clearcoat is beginning to peel on the roof After 150 000 miles though you cant not_be not_too not_surprised My voice can go lower than these 6x9s I just put in a Kenwood CD player and some Polk speakers I bought this car because it was Saturday and I needed to get to work on Monday It took with it 3 02 sensors some belts and hoses the water pump the power steering assembly a turn signal assembly and some fuel lines The trunk lines dont not_seem not_to not_fit not_together not_evenly but I suspect the guy before me was in a slight accident The fluid monitoring system is gone too I think the transmission missed the rear defrost because it went around the same time The only part of the interior that shows any sign of wear are the seats which are very worn and uncomfortable Well some clamp came loose on the radiator which caused some antifreeze to spill out Not too bad only 30 UPDATE 06 03 01 It would make a good car for a single person or a couple who isnt not_ready not_smart not_enough not_to

and long It is still a little off balanced as far as weight distribution but the handling has improved Check out my review of the Firestone Firehawk tires UPDATE 09 09 00 At least the dealership where I bought it from agreed to pay for half of my new transmission which I had repaired elsewhere The passenger automatic seat belt is possessed I just try not not_to not_upset not_it not_I not_have

lets see whos first to 100 mph turbos need not not_apply Thats pretty wimpy for a V8 ive had the thing burried way past 85 The radio rots im not not_sure not_if not_its not_just not_old or if radios

afford anything over 5000 at the time so when my buddy called about the 91 Thunderbird I jumped at the offer Well the starter went out so I had to replace that 116 000 mile isnt not_too not_bad not_for not_something not_like not_that not_That brings the grand total for the repair bill to about 4500 since I bought this car in August of 99 im not not_liking not_this not_car not_so not_much not_UPDATE not_01 not_03 not_00 The mechanic actually said there had been a fume fire on my gas tank I think I might have bent over on that one but who knows I think my tires are getting lonely I will have to replace them in a few weeks Let me start by stating that I purchased this car with 97 000 miles on it and it currently has 145 000 miles I will reveal how this car has held up after 9 years and 1145 000 miles and what I have done to it within my first 50 000 miles This car likes to roll into turns no matter how slow you go It sort of wobbles when I turn Its not not_visible wobble but it feels like it moves from side to side while turning This got better after I purchased new tires for it but its starting to happen again with only about 30 000 miles on the new tires Apparently this car only likes brand new tires Even these entry level items are a vast improvement I may be crazy but I love my T Bird Despite its shortcomings theres just something about driving a V8 T Bird I will definitely miss this car when its time to trade it in for a familymobile I would recommend this car as a first car for people in high school because it is a cheap car to buy the resale value is horrible but the V8 would get them into trouble and the V6 is laughable I put in another 2 grand into this thing I replaced the shocks oil pan and a bunch of brake junk I had to recharge the A C again which is becoming an annual event The Check Engine light comes on for no reason I must say the car rides so much better now that I have replaced the shocks I also had to replace the tire rods and a buch of crap related to that The cars more quiet now and rides much stiffer Its nice Still make sure you dont not_buy not_one not_of not_these not_things not_with not_100k not_miles not_on not_it

Neg,The drivers side seat was quite comfortable However this is not not_so not_bad not_for not_a not_V not_6 not_with not_196hp not_Comfort The normal Mustang comes with a 3 8 liter V 6 engine with 196hp With this powerful 3 6 liter V 6 196 hp engine this car definitely drives very well on those rough highways The inside space of the car as well as the trunk space seem to be larger than earlier models As a trade off to the fast acceleration the fuel efficiency of the car was not not_so not_good not_Based not_on not_my not_rough not_estimate the car drove about 25 miles per gallon This is definitely a big improvement from 80s Mustangs Design Compared to Mustangs long time competitors like Camaros and Firebirds Mustang definitely made a great improvement of its design and image An American legend After rented a 4 door Mazda for one week I was ready for something more powerful to drive around rough highways in the Los Angeles area during my business trip The GT models come with a 4 6 liter V 6 engine with 260 hp Because I only drove a non GT I am sure that GT performs totally different from my review This I was impressed to find the traction control which definitely helps to reduce the chance of losing control of the vehicle under bad weather conditions Performance Basically there are two different models for 2001 Mustang What did I rent A 2 door 2001 Ford Mustang which came with standard options such as dual airbags cruise control power windows CD player and A C In addition to those standard items the car had a traction control However the suspension system of the car seemed to be not not_working not_as not_nicely not_as not_a not_regular not_sedan not_like not_a not_Toyota not_Camry not_Basically not_the not_suspension not_system not_does not_not not_absorb not_shocks not_very not_well not_However not_this not_seems not_to not_be not_a not_quite not_common not_symptom not_for not_a not_sports not_car As soon as I stepped on the pedal I knew that I chose the right vehicle to drive around the highways of the LA area I could not not_compare not_the not_way not_the not_car not_accelerated not_with not_a not_4 not_cylinder not_sedan not_Despite not_the not_fact not_that not_the not_car not_accelerated not_very not_fast not_the not_noise not_from not_the not_engine not_was not_not not_annoying not_at not_all not_I not_no not_longer not_felt not_scared not_when not_I not_was not_merging not_onto not_a not_freeway not_People not_were not_flying not_on not_a not_merging not_lane While keeping its identity as a traditional American sports car the current Mustang body was designed based on the first generation Mustang this car looks classier than ever I guess I am not not_a not_big not_fan not_of not_those not_bad not_boy not_looking not_cars not_like not_Firebirds not_and not_Camaros not_Believe not_it not_or not_not not_Marketers not_for not_those not_cars not_target not_those not_people not_who not_are not_attracted not_to not_a not_bad not_boys not_image not_Overall not_I not_really not_enjoyed not_driving not_this not_car not_on not_the not_highways not_in not_the not_Los not_Angeles not_area
Neg,The Mustang seemed to hesitate when making evasive maneuvers It was like driving my moms Civic except extremely uncomfortable and with poor handling The Miata won and I was disappointed by the lack of performance in this beautiful car I was driving My friend bought it anyway and thats great for him But I ll stick with my CRX thank you very much That reminds me the handling im used to my little CRX which can stop on a dime and with the right tires make 90 degree turns are 30mph The car is pretty heavy too which made it feel more like a truck than a sporty coupe Needless to say I can not not_recommend not_this not_car not_Its not_too not_unrefined not_for not_my not_tastes and lacks the amount of power you d expect from a legend What gives I realise its a sports car but how hard would it have been to give you a couple extra inches of legroom I wont even talk about the rear seat its more of a storage space for your stuff that wont fit in the tiny trunk than a place for people to sit Next up performance I recently got to test drive a 2001 Ford Mustang with my friend who is going to buy it The particular car we drove was a V6 manual transmission convertible I ll say it right now the car looks really cool I felt like a millionaire driving it Bright yellow with a black convertible top and a black leather interior Its definitely a fun car but only on the outside For a car that looks so pretty you d expect it to have the innards to back up its racey look Not so my friend I actually street raced someone I know not not_smart who was driving a Miata I could see they had a five speed too but heres the thing Miatas are rated at I believe 135 hp they re also a 4 cylinder while the V6 Mustang is rated at 160hp On the inside you re treated to horribly uncomfortable font bucket seats and an even worse rear seat Even though everything was covered in soft leather the seats were hard and unforgiving I can stay put in my 1991 CRX for 6 hours without a single problem but my back hurt after half an hour of driving this beast Not only that but the legroom was awful I can completely stretch my legs out in my CRX im 6 1 but in the Mustang my knees hit the dash with the seat scooted all the way back
Neg,With the 3 0 it was a higher 2 800 RPM This car can be found for around 2 000 The interior of the 1990 Ford Taurus is almost all new for this year These cars go for very cheap today the Ford Taurus has terrible resale value For 1990 4 engines are available the base engine is a 2 5 liter that produces 90 horsepower The exterior looks almost exactly like it did back in 1986 very little exterior changes have occurred since introduction But for those who need a car but dont not_have not_a not_lot not_of not_money this is good news This engine is found in a multitude of Ford Mercury and Lincoln automobiles first seen in the Ford Thunderbird as a base engine In fact this style was so adored in 1990 the Ford Taurus was the best selling car in America i Pricing Reliability i The 1990 Ford Taurus still has the same AXOD 4 speed automatic transmission but since 1989 it has larger fluid lines so ATF can lubricate vital parts more efficiently There is the Vulcan V6 3 0 liter which produced 140 horsepower found in all models and the 3 8 which is found in the GL and LX models The dash is totally changed from its predecessor and is much easier on the eyes than it once was Ergonomics are very simple and easy to use This may not not_seem not_like not_a not_lot not_in not_fact not_its not_not but it does not not_do not_too not_bad not_of not_a not_job not_moving not_this not_car not_around not_the not_2 not_5 not_4 not_cylinder was dropped in 1992 The LX model I drove had power everything including leather power seats with power lumbar support 6 speaker premium Ford sound system which sounded excellent for a stock system of this time period and manual keyless entry One of my major gripes with the 1990 Ford Tauruss interior is the lack of bucket seats Instead Ford uses a split bench front which aids in more seating however results in lower levels of support vs a bucket seat design Exterior Innovation i You will notice that the 3 8 compared to the OHV 3 0 models that acceleration from the light is much quicker hills are a snap and cruising is hushed At 70 MPH the 1990 Ford Taurus 3 8 is cruising at an aprrox 2 100 RPM There is also since 1989 a new engine by Yamaha which is a 3 0 liter DOHC V6 engine that produces an impressive 220 horsepower and 200 lb ft of torque this engine unfortunately can only be found in the expensive SHO super high output models i Interior Innovation i These cars have been known to cause their owners a great deal of misery Other Cars To Consider i 1 Honda Accord 2 Chevy Lumina a href content 63653777028 http www epinions com content 63653777028 a My Review 3 Toyota Camry 4 Buick Le Sabre 5 Dodge Dynasty 6 Plymouth Acclaim 7 Chevy Corsica 8 Chevy Beretta 9 Nissan Maxima 10 Nissan Stanza Happy Car Shopping The paint has improved over the 4 years and the rear tail lights look more modern Back in 1990 this car was still ahead of its time GM still had its boxy Buick Century and other boxy family cars but they were starting to get the hint that Ford had something going with this whole aerodynamic theme The only problem is is that the 1990 Ford Taurus has a reputation for being a lemon I personally have never owned a 1990 ford Taurus but I did own a Mercury Sable for over a year with the same powertrain and it had loads of problems including transmission bands breaking lots of money to fix starter problems alternator fuel pump power steering pump lines new struts wheel bearings and a few other things The headliners on these cars are awful Since this is almost 2003 most of these headliners are already ripped you most likely will be hard pressed finding a 90 Taurus with a mint condition interior i Final Thoughts i I do not not_recommend not_the not_1990 not_Ford not_Taurus not_however not_if not_this not_car not_is not_a not_must not_on not_your not_car not_shopping not_list not_I not_cant not_stress not_enough not_how not_important not_it not_is not_that not_you not_take not_it not_to not_a not_professional not_mechanic s ince late 1985 when the Ford Taurus first was shown at autoshows around the world it was almost an instant hit people loved this aerodynamic concept looking car with no front grille Finally in 1986 the Ford Taurus went on sale along with its sister car the Mercury Sable i Driving Impressions i My tester 1990 Ford Taurus unlike the 1987 models came with a more powerful 3 8 liter V6 as an option Actual horsepower specs are the same between the 3 0 OHV Vulcan and the OHV Essex V6 but unlike the Vulcan it reaches its 140 horsepower at a much lower RPM and instead of 160 lb ft of torque it has a more impressive 215 lb ft The 3 8 is fuled by multi port fuel injection and is a pushrod design
Neg,The cruise control worked sometimes The dealer service WHAT dealer service It would decide to start The ignition module failed 4 or 5 times The seats were threadbare before 100 000 miles That revealed serious disfiguring rust in the unibody and floorboards It would sit for days and then BAM The trunk had a basketball sized hole in it from rust It was white with a black interior which proved to be very hot in the summer time The turn signal stalk broke off and the one I got at the junkyard broke off too The PRNDL gear indicator was way off so it looked like it was in reverse when it was really in drive The Taurus left me stranded so many times I almost got fired from my job for being late or no show so much The windows doors and windshields leaked so badly that I eventually had to rip out the carpeting and padding and throw it all away due to mold The boss just couldnt believe there was a car this unreliable but it was true So finally in April 1998 I bought a new GMC Sonoma Thats a total POS too read my review on that lemon here on Epinions I got 1000 for the Taurus on a trade in and still owed 3800 on it for repairs The fuel injection had to be replaced at 69 000 miles I went through so many power steering pumps I forgot to keep track im guessing five or more My parents bought the 1990 Taurus L brand new in August 1990 I thought it was only the second car they ever bought that wasnt not_dorky looking the other being a 1981 Monte Carlo It took me 2 years to pay off on a car I didnt not_even not_own not_anymore not_NO not_MORE not_American not_made not_junk not_for not_me not_My not_next not_car not_will not_come not_from not_Germany not_or not_Japan not_end not_of not_comment The windshield would drip on my feet it rusted the brake pedal Electrical problem that was never solved began around 90 k entire electrical system would go dead except the battery which was fully charged The headliner fell out the door panels fell off the struts on the hood gave out so I had to prop it open with a 2x4 to work on it The suspension was forever out of alignment They gave me the car as a college graduation present in May 1996 with 42 000 miles on it I drove it to 148 000 miles somehow I ll start by saying what I liked Styling The five Alternators lasted maybe 30 000 miles water pumps lasted 40 000 went through 4 of those too I got really darned good at replacing things under the hood THe factory radiator was plastic and it cracked through at 70 000 miles The transmissions always shifted hard and abrupt with a lot of gear whine The CV boots were always disentigrating The Ford brake pads were good for maybe 25 000 miles a set front rotors lasted twice that rear drums went only 70 000 miles and this was with nothing but highway driving The ignition switch wore out every 40 000 miles Eventually the locking mechanism kept jamming so I took a crowbar and just broke the darned thing and started the car by just pulling up on the little rod inside the steering column Everyone thought it was a stolen car because of that no just poor Ford quality By the time I scraped together the cash to buy a new vehicle the engine was just about shot and the cylinder compression was gone in two cylinders plus the oil pump was gone and the valvetrain was tapping badly sounded like an old Chrysler Slant Six if ya know what I mean The stereo speakers sounded good until I put a 50 watt per channel JVC in there and it blew them up in a few days I also liked the big mirrors on the Taurus Now for the bad And there was a lot of bad The car went through two transmissions each costing 1800 The Ford dealers in Louisville KY are these giant conglomerate corporations that care about money not not_customer not_service not_I not_learned not_to not_just not_go not_buy not_the not_parts not_and not_do not_the not_work not_myself not_as not_they not_either not_didnt not_have not_mechanics not_who not_were not_competent not_or not_they not_just not_rolled not_their not_eyes not_when not_yet not_another not_problem not_Taurus not_came not_in not_for not_repairs The taurus was a great looking car about the right size to carry 4 5 people comfortable seats very legible gauges good acceleration with the 3 0 V6 great handling good cargo room in the trunk I also liked the air conditioner which was much stronger than other Fords ive driven when it worked I liked the fake wood strip on the dashboard it looked like wood not not_plastic
Neg,In time the drivers side window became a problem My mom started it and we were on our way It felt like we were riding in an enclosed lawnmower That is what it felt and sounded like We were lucky to get the worst car ever a 4 cyl taurus Ohhh i remember going with her to pick it up It looked nice in the garage it was in really it did So depressing My mom bought this car in 1994 after her last car was stolen My mom had a 1986 Ford Taurus I belive it was the first year of of cars The way it sounded was the very least that was wrong with the car All these things happned within 7500 miles of eachother when we got the car it had 49 000 miles piece of junk no Thats right folks pouring rain up a hill in the worst area of NYC and lots of traffic I wasnt not_too not_happy and niether was the 20 cars behind me Someone did help me push the car though The windsheild washer pump never worked and winshield wipers didnt not_work not_either not_OK not_OK not_and not_the not_rear not_bumber not_was not_falling not_off not_since not_the not_day not_we not_got not_the not_car not_Needless not_to not_say not_the not_tranmission not_died not_again not_and not_my not_mom not_gave not_to not_car not_away It was fine to open but when it came time to close the window went out instead of up real nice for protection huh The car wasnt not_very not_mechanically not_well not_built not_either not_I not_was not_lucky not_enough not_to not_be not_driving not_the not_car not_when not_its not_transmission not_droppd not_dead Oh yea another thing the hood couldnt stay up by itself he held it open with a hockey stick oh yea and another thing about opening the hood well the thing u pulled back on to make the hood release broke off so we had to pull the wires with a vice grip So after the transmission was fixed it worked sort of A few monthes later the car went on fire now that i think about it it was taken to the mechanic at least once a week because the engine was smoking severly overheating Did i metion we kept water in the car incase the car went on fire
Neg,It only had 28 500 We also miss the cargo space tremendously They temporarily fixed the climate control but it broke again It was a good car but it simply was not not_reliable The digital speedometer always a mistake and automatic climate control began to fail The first seven years were totally trouble free but in late 96 early 97 it began to develop problems There was some leak in the line to the speedometer causing it to suddenly register 0 while driving down a highway So we took it into the shop and they claimed to fix the transmission but of course it was a Ford dealership and they basically lied to us And the climate control system would blow either too little or too much air it was basically as uncooperative as possible That Spring the transmission began to have problems It was mainly having problems going from first and second gear but it got so that we had to manually shift the car from first to second And finally in May of 1999 a head gasket blew and a belt snapped Its been parked on the street every since while we debated and procrastinated deciding its fate The 3 8L V 6 was very peppy handling was secure for a wagon and the climate control and trip computer were all somewhat ahead of their time a bit too much so it would appear I had a 90 Ford Taurus wagon which I just got rid of The reason it cost more to repair the car than it was actually worth So we donated it to a local school and the cars problems will be fixed and it will be washed and waxed and hopefully whoever gets the car will be very grateful After all it was one of those low mileage cream puffs The night it was towed away I still remember that the interior smelled fresh the car glistened in the moonlight and the tow driver was truly amazed we wanted him to tow this new car away And on the whole it was a very good car Things were OK until December of 98 when the drivers side power seat simply failed I was never too confident in the design especially considering how much stuff is hanging down below that seat it just doesnt look as well designed as other power seat systems ive seen
Neg,Two of the times it was the water pump busting But there are other problems with the car I would just like to emphasize My family did not not_have not_a not_lot not_of not_money not_to not_just not_dish not_out not_around not_1500 not_dollars not_for not_another not_air not_conditioner and I found out later that this is a problem with many Ford vehicles until the mid 1990s My parents bought this car when i was elementary school and I loved it For a family car this had enough room to keep my parents from constantly telling my sister and me to stop arguing about space issues in the back seat The third time it broke down on me it had something to do with my air conditioner indirectly Apparently when your compressor goes that is what happened to the air conditioning it is directly linked to the starter in a Ford vehicle But things began to take a turn for the worst about two years after the purchase of the car used it then being around 2 or 3 years old About 5 years ago my family was riding home in it and the air conditioning just went out like that No warning just stopped My sister has the car now and the last time I talked with my father he said that the transmission is about to go and for a 1990 model it only has 100 000 miles on it During the time I drove it it broke down on me three times So if you do purchase a Ford vehicle before 1994 make sure that the air conditioner is working or is new because if it isnt not_new not_9 not_times not_out not_of not_10 not_isnt not_operational not_I not_began not_driving not_the not_car not_two not_years not_ago not_as not_a not_junior not_in not_high not_school not_Living not_in not_Texas and not not_having not_air not_conditioning not_is not_a not_scary not_situation not_and not_led not_me not_to not_almost not_pass not_out not_on not_one not_ride not_home So if you try using something that requires using the compressor it will stop you car I did not not_know not_this not_at not_the not_time not_so not_during not_a not_downpour not_I not_needed not_to not_use not_my not_defrost not_because not_I not_couldnt not_see not_outside not_of not_my not_window not_Upon not_doing not_this not_my not_car not_stopped not_in not_a not_busy not_intersection not_and not_I not_was not_forced not_to not_push not_my not_car not_to not_the not_gas not_station not_that not_luckily not_was not_right not_near not_where not_my not_car not_broke not_down not_I not_have not_no not_idea not_if not_this not_car not_just not_hates not_me not_or not_if not_it not_is not_honestly not_a not_bad not_car not_my not_suggestion not_Please not_avoid not_1990 not_Taurus not_like not_a not_plague not_I not_knew not_two not_other not_people not_that not_had not_a not_car not_similar not_to not_this not_one not_and not_the not_air not_conditioner not_in not_their not_cars not_broke not_as not_well not_If not_you not_live not_up not_north not_where not_the not_high not_does not_not not_reach not_110 not_that not_frequently not_then not_by not_all not_means not_this not_car not_is not_probably not_the not_car not_for not_you not_But not_if not_you not_live not_in not_a not_hot not_area not_take not_your not_chances not_on not_something not_else
Neg,At first the car was reliable and drove fine but after a few months the problems started Here is a chronological list of the problems I have had over the last 2 and a half years Jan 2000 regulator broken That value of my car is only 1000 at best so repairing it is pointless I continue to drive the car as of June 13th 2002 but the transmission gets worse every day Currently the car is at 125 000 miles My Ford Taurus experience began in October of 1999 when I purchased the car for around 2000 I was attending Stonehill College in Easton MA at the time and needed a vehicle to drive to Quincy MA where I live The car will not not_start not_I not_have not_this not_fixed not_Apr not_2000 not_car not_rattles not_Mechanic not_thinks not_it not_is not_the not_struts but I do not not_need not_to not_replace not_them not_June not_2000 not_AC not_broken not_Just not_in not_time not_for not_the not_summer not_I not_have not_this not_fixed not_Feb not_2001 not_Alternator not_broken not_I not_have not_this not_one not_fixed not_Aug not_2001 not_Problems not_shifting not_into not_reverse The car takes a few seconds to shift into reverse im told there is a problem with my brakes but it is not not_too not_critical not_Aug not_Feb not_2002 not_Reversing not_problem not_gets not_worse not_Mechanic not_tells not_me not_that not_my not_brakes not_are not_the not_problem not_New not_brakes not_are not_supposed not_to not_fix not_the not_problem not_Aug not_2002 not_280 not_brake not_work not_Car not_still not_has not_problem not_shifting not_into not_reverse not_Mechanic not_now not_tells not_me not_that not_it not_is not_my not_transmission not_Estimated not_price not_for not_repair not_is not_1500 The thing that was surprising to me about the Taurus is that two of my friends Taurus died when the transmissions went One died at around 75 000 miles and the other at 125 000 miles I am no expert when it comes to cars but from my own personal experiences with the Ford Taurus and that of my friends I would highly recommend seeking another type of automobile From my current understanding the Ford Taurus is not not_built not_to not_last and if you have one expect the transmission to die Good luck
Neg,The problem is the engine It gets about 20 MPG The paint has been durable On the positive side this car is smooth and comfortable The seats are nicely padded and wear well In summary buy this model if you can afford the repairs The controls help the driver and passenger determine the positioning and angle of each seat It looked great on the used car lot had less than 100 000 and passed the inspection of professional mechanic The heater and air conditioner are hard to get to and may cost about 1 500 to repair I bought a 1987 Ford Taurus station wagon in 1994 to obtain comfort and space at a reasonable price I have now owned it for five years The power steering begins to leak at about 125 000 miles requiring the mechanism and hoses to be replaced I gave my car regular preventative care however these repairs cost me more than I paid for the car Ouch There are weaknesses in the transmission heating cooling system and power steering These require thousands of dollars to repair Most every owner I have spoken to have reported the same weaknesses Count on rebuilding the transmission at about 100 000 miles
Neg,By far the biggest problem with this car is the transmission When it doesnt work you look at a 2100 transmission rebuilding estimate When it works its sloppy has a late or no downshift and slips While the car did its job moving to and from school once per day its not not_dependable While you can sand it off easily and coat it again in paint the rust simply keeps on coming back The 1990 Ford Taurus offered a comfortable ride for the two years I had it But its list of problems are long and serious Starting with the outside the pain has a terrible habit of rusting at the edges of the doors The transmission shop confirmed that this car has major transmission troubles My Taurus started losing fluid to the point where pouring fluid back was not not_sufficient not_it not_leaked not_out not_the not_front not_seal not_the not_second not_the not_transmission not_was not_set not_in not_motion The engine is louder and a poor performer for being a V6 Gas mileage is average at roughly 30 The interior has problems involving squeaky door panels and power locks which break Idle can turn rough on a cold start its very apparent when sitting at a stop light the engine will rev up and down once per second causing the car to rock a new O2 sensor did not not_solve not_this not_problem
Neg,The power windows are rather neat On the other hand the seats arent comfortable They are very stiff and thin for bucket seats The trimline on this Windstar is the SE package The doors do lead me to one major complaint The vehicle does come with power windows and power locks This vehicle is also equipped with an AM FM cassette stereo This leads to a very smooth ride inside the van I dont not_like not_Fords not_as not_a not_matter not_of not_practice While many vehicles these days have keyless entry this particular van didnt You see ive had two really crummy experiences with them It also has front and rear climate controls which was a neat idea The liftgate does open straight up and is a single door in this model It will climb hills especially when you shut off the overdrive As I stated before I had two different female passengers in this van As an insurance adjustor ive never been a fan of this feature on cars There are two sliding passenger doors on this vehicle which makes for a very nice option By hills I mean the Rocky Mountains of Colorado which is where I live It is a comfortable shift of gears that is barely noticeable unless you floor the accelerator With the sliding doors you can also park in very tight spaces and still gain access to the vehicle This is neat for children who sometimes complain that they are too hot or too cold Other features include power mirrors a SecureLock anti theft system and dual air bags It does have an 1800 pound payload capacity and you can fit furniture inside the cargo area with the seats removed The front passengers can control the temperature for the front of the vehicle and the rear passengers can control the temperature back there This is a good feature for people like my dad who for some reason refuses to buckle up It is your basic package not not_a not_whole not_lot not_of not_bells not_and not_whistles not_are not_included not_but not_it not_does not_have not_some not_nice not_creature not_comforts While I wasnt not_hauling not_around not_cargo not_or not_kids I could see where this feature was a blessing especially for cargo As far as I can tell there is no way to raise or lower the rear panel window in the liftgate There is a plastic armrest that can be lifted and lowered but it is at an unnatural position when in the lowered position The transmission shifts gears smoothly without any real jarring In fact I would say the transmission is as smooth as my Taurus The problem arises from the fact that some idiot at Ford chose to put the only outside key entry to this vehicle in the passenger door The one thing I have never been able to complain about with Ford products is that they do make a rather comfortable vehicle You lose major points with me on that even if most people would find that complaint silly This vehicle comes with a six cylinder 3 8 liter engine that produces 200 horsepower at 4900 rpm and 240 foot pounds of torque at 3600 rpm My first was a 1997 Taurus Problems started with that vehicle the first day I drove it home from the dealer and it needed a tow that afternoon There is no flashy trim with this vehicle that would distinguish itself from any other minivan although it does have a factory roof rack and molded bumpers This vehicle is equipped with an accessory delay which allows you to manipulate the stereo and the windows after you ve already shut off the vehicle The front windows go up and down just like in any other car However the back windows pop in and out like van windows did they just do it automatically When I was growing up my mother taught me that chivalry was not not_dead and that you open and close car doors for your women passengers It meant that with the rear seats out you could slide the doors open and have someone pull from either direction to help load the vehicle That was one of thirteen tows that vehicle needed in the 55 000 miles I put on the vehicle and they never found the problem The passenger bench seats are as comfortable as bench seats can be They provide little support for the lumbar or the thighs but then again ive never been in a vehicle that does It is advertised to get 18mpg in the city and 22mpg on the highway Because I do a lot of mountain driving I got far less gas mileage than what was advertised While this is a tall vehicle people of shorter stature is that the politically correct term these days should have little trouble reaching the liftgate in its open position I have to give Ford credit for this feature Thats the extent of the fanciness outside Inside it comes with two benches in the rear that not not_only fold down but slide out of the vehicle totally turning it from a passenger van into a cargo van Another funny thing with the stereo was that when I turn off the engine the stereo keeps running I can pull the key out open the drivers door and close it and the radio still runs The seats provide plenty of room inside I certainly cannot not_complain not_about

not_feeling may come from a pain in the backside literally to take the seats out Its supposed to be a simple process you fold the seat down tug on a hook on the floor and the seat is supposed to slide right out I dont not_claim not_to not_be not_the not_most not_mechanical not_person not_in not_the not_world but it took some engineering thoughts on my end before I was successful in removing the seat from the floor The second problem is my current vehicle the 1999 Taurus which is in the shop as we speak due to a recall and several electrical problems that are being fixed under warranty I know I know im supposed to be talking about a 2000 Ford Windstar and thats exactly what this review is about im renting one and have had one for the last week A Ford Windstar is a minivan I must also state that I dislike minivans very much I think without being insulting that they look dorky and they re made for exactly who im not not_a not_soccer not_mom So what are my recommendations Well Id say if you want a comfortable ride in a minivan then the Ford Windstar is for you If you want a comfortable minivan you may want to look elsewhere im pretty annoyed with the idea that theres no passenger

Neg,My first impression was what a piece of junk The seats were pretty comfortable especially for this type of vehicle The styling is kind of nice although its apparent that Ford took a Chevy Venture and added some NewEdge think Cougar details If you re observant you can easily tell how much the owner paid for each Windstar by the regular or elaborate front grille The fit and finish is absolutely horrible the quality of the materials makes this van basically like a large economy car Maybe the 30 000 version comes with better material I rented a vehicle for vacation last week and unfortunately they didnt not_have not_much not_of not_a not_selection not_so not_I not_ended not_up not_with not_a not_new not_Ford not_Windstar The driver side sliding door is 99 useless and its even hard to get in by the one on the other side because a large and very annoying seat belt makes rear passengers feel caged in The only other thing I have to say about it is Why is this van so radically popular when it is A Pretty shoddy and A total spinoff of GMs vans The power drivers seat is the best the passengers is okay and the 2 bench seats in the back only hold a total of 4 very small children comfortably Family van I guess but definitely not not_a not_van not_to not_hold not_more not_than not_two not_adults not_Overall not_its not_an not_okay not_van not_good not_for not_those not_on not_a not_budget and who dont not_mind not_admitting not_it not_by not_buying not_one not_of not_these The stereo was decent but its radio reception on a scale of 1 to 10 was a negative 40 Theres no antenna in sight anywhere so im guessing its just a wire hidden under the windshield or something Believe it or not not_my not_opinion changed when I first drove it Its a real blast to drive it has pretty good acceleration and braking although the unrefined drivetrain feels too much like my large E150 full size van Since its built on a car platform it rides nicely very low to the ground and it doesnt feel like you re going to tip over like in most other vans Fun to drive or not not_the not_materials still kept their cheap quality and although the steering wheel was kind of nice when I reversed out of a driveway and tried to shift it into drive the position of the steering wheel never let me view the dashboard to see what gear I was going into
Neg,My advise stay away from Ford products with FWD automatic transmissions The main problem is that Ford uses the Ford Taurse transmission in these mini vans Oh yea a rebuilt transmission could cost anywhere from 2 200 to 2 800 Oh yea I now drive a 4 dr Honda Accord to work each day quite a step from a SUV UPDATE The wife an I both work outside the home and I drove a 1992 Ford Explorer and the wife drove a 1991 4 door Honda Accord These transmissions are alread plagued with problems and when you add the extra 800 lbs of a mini van its just asking for trouble We had just returned home from a 11 hour road trip only to have the transmission completely fail while trying to take off from a stop light If your debating the different mini vans look beyond Ford and go with Toyota or better yet Honda I ll likely trade mine in as soon as it gets back from the dealer Our family recently purchased a new 2000 Ford Windstar SEL and so far I have been very pleased with the purchase which when you read on you ll understand that this is saying a lot We are a family of 4 with two boys 10 and 6 We purchased an SEL model with leather CD Cassette dual A C back up sensors and power sliding doors driver passenger side etc After owning this vehicle for 3 months now we could be happier yes me too Gas mileage in town is been running 17 18 MPG and 23 25 on the highway It gave me no warning of any kind just a large crunch when trying to accelerate away from a stop light Get this The warranty expired less than 60 days earlier and after the road trip the van now has 37 K miles on it Ford has agreed to pick up part of the cost but im stuck with a 950 repair It has plenty of power to pull the camper and plenty of room for kids and related sporting equipment I am very picky about vehicles and this van has impressed me as being very solid and free from defects I do hear quick and slight drive train grind when initially driving off after the van has been parked for a while but it only lasts a split second and doesnt re occur until the van is stopped and restarted The other annomily that ive heard is the occasional sound of water from the A C dripping on the exhaust when going down the highway Finally I thought that the power sliding doors was a bit too much when we first purchased the van but after owning it for a couple weeks I realized just how conveinent that option was No hands door opening keeps kids from scratching the doors ensures that they can get in even on hill sides and makes it nice for putting groceries in when your hands are full We love to go camping and we pull a medium size Colemann Pop Up camper when we are able to go I was starting to have serious problems with the Ford Explorer and we decided it was time to buy a new tow vehicle After looking at other manly vehicles Tahoe Lincoln Navigators Suburbans etc I just couldnt justify their cost and fuel mileage Besides the wife typically takes the boys and their friends to recreational activities so she would be driving it as often as I did After some discussion and believe me I was not not_an not_easy not_sell not_we not_decided not_to not_look not_into not_mini not_vans not_as not_an not_option not_to not_replace not_the not_Explorer not_Needless not_to not_say not_I not_swallowed not_my not_manly not_pride and we are now owners of a mini van After looking into many different models we decided on Ford because they were offering 60 months 9 financing at the time on the Windstar and they came packaged with the best options for the price
Neg,It is big I am a soccer mom Dont make the same mistake They pop out with the ashtray There are two up front We get drinks spilled alot The SEL has one on each side The SEL comes with 2nd row captains chairs The manual sucks and the levers stick And getting it back in is even worse The SEL is the top of the line The doors are large and swing open wide It comes with a front console between the bucket seats So the third bench is stuck there more on that later The rear bench thankfully has decent cupholders but they are the only ones It doesnt split in half and it is heavy as hell And until ive paid a little more off on my loan I have no choices If its a soda or worse coffee from fast food the top can and does pop off That way if I wanted to go to BJs I could easily make the 3rd seat disappear The Toyota Sierra has cup holders that fold into the sliding doors Almost everyone else does NOT have the pinchers That means there is less than 20 cu ft of storage space behind it That is peanuts folks And I got this car at a discount but if I were to do it over again and I WON this car in a raffle You may be able to park it but you might have to choose which side of the car gets to exit If you arent using the third bench the Windstar probably has plenty of room I wouldnt not_know not_I not_have not_4 not_young not_children If I put the stroller in the passenger compartment then the kids trip on their way in and out Even weekend trips tax our abilities to travel comfortably It has no additional cup holders in it This is significant SUVs often have a place for drinks on the console Not the Windstar There is no alternative place for cupholders for me and no place to hold a drink for a kid who cant not_reach not_his not_her not_own not_cupholder With as much time as we spend in the car it is unrealistic not not_to not_have not_the not_kids not_or not_me not_drink not_something not_at not_some not_part not_of not_the not_day And hope you never have to do it if you own one Everything disgusting and vile congregates in those wells Keypad entry All of Fords SUVs have this feature If I put an umbrella stroller back there and that is the smallest version of stroller out there I am hard put to fit a weeks worth of groceries in the back There is an additional port by the passenger but its so close to the floor that no cell phone could be used if plugged in and few laptop cords I own an SEL However I think the ground clearance thing would be true of almost any Minivan Most of our relatives live a couple hours away Once this car gets on the highway it is LOUD Also I should note that if you want to recharge your cell phone of you have a passenger charging his laptop he ll have to hold his drink The Grand Caravan has tons of room behind the third seat I think almost twice as much as the Windstar But if I was to get another Minivan I think the Honda would be my car Id throw the keys away First let me say ive driven this car for 18 months so what I write I write from experience Some people may find the following complaints nit picky The smallest piece of crayon A stray nickel can keep it from closing Sometimes these things get stuck in the track to the point where the door doesnt quite close but cant not_then not_open not_easily not_either not_Storage You leave the umbrella stroller home Add a portacrib Give everyone a small duffle and thats it You are out of room Half the Windstars around here have luggage carriers permanently strapped to the roof with good reason Lets talk 3rd bench The cup holders are near the floor of the chairs and flip down Kids in carseats cant not_reach not_them not_at not_all not_Younger not_children not_not not_in not_carseats not_still not_have not_trouble not_reaching not_them not_Adults not_sitting not_in not_those not_seats not_have not_to not_grab not_the not_drink not_from not_the not_top If you put in a heavy drink whether a full water bottle or a coffee thermos and you dont not_close not_the not_pinchers the drink ends up on your foot If its heavy enough it ll end up on your foot anyway the first time you make a turn Which means my options are either a minivan with the 2nd and 3rd row intact or an extra large SUV Anyone who owns an extra large SUV and we do knows that they are not not_the not_car not_that not_you not_take not_to not_zip not_in not_and not_out not_of not_busy not_parking not_lots Then the car starts to smell Its amazing how fast and how bad a little orange soda or the smallest drop of a vanilla shake can smell Dont discount this Lack of useable cupholders is a big issue to anyone who drives but especially those of us with children Automatic closing doors But once this lemon is paid down im giving serious look at the Buick Rendevous With the snow around here Central Mass I need something that can fit 4 kids easily and please NOT with a 2nd row seat that you have to pop up to get to the back bench with more ground clearance that is still easy to park at the Soccer Field or the local Shop n Stop My oldest daughter lost her retainer in the car I had to take out the third bench and both captains chairs before I found it in the well of where one the chairs hooks in I did it myself I am a small but strong person but I can tell you I hope I never have to do it again Even with two people getting the third seat out is unwieldy at best No joke I dont

Neg,He also told me that his bosses 2000 Windstar had the same vibration He did not not_answer not_me not_I not_did not_not not_have not_this not_vibration not_in not_my not_1995 not_Windstar not_why not_was not_it not_added not_in not_2000 not_and not_removed not_in not_2001 The questions to ask yourself is what did Ford change in newer models and why if in their words the issue in the 2000 model is a normal operating condition He stated to me that it was a normal operating condition to me it was not not_anything not_normal and I would not not_have not_purchased not_a not_2000 not_Windstar not_if not_I not_would not_have not_noticed not_it not_during not_our not_test not_drive That is what I was told by a a Ford Motor Company engineer who I met with to discuss a vibration in the gas pedal at 2 250 RPM since that time the vibration has gotten much worse and at times the transmission hesitates shifting to the next highest gear The first time I noticed it was when we were driving 3 hours and I noticed it at highway speeds and my foot started falling to sleep I questioned the engineer at the time if this was normal then why did Ford fix the problem in the 2001 models My concern is what does it mean Could it be mismatched parts incorrect tolerances something wearing in the transmission and will I have a problem after 36 000 miles are on the vehicle Consumer Reports even suggests to stay away from several of the model year Windstars including the 2000 model additional note I talked to an ex engineer at Ford and he was not not_surprised not_what not_I not_was not_experiencing not_because not_his not_parents not_complained not_about not_the not_same not_vibration not_in not_their not_2000 not_Windstar
Neg,And I made close to a thousand dollars of commission off that one van Think about an Expedition instead Low rating because of lack of popularity The dealership took a big hit but they were losing 3 a month for just having it on the lot That happens after the vehicle sits on the lot for over 90 days but over 120 days it gets ridiculous for the dealership to hold on to So if you have to have a Windstar make sure you Dont pay for it Thats just the point of view of a salesman not not_a not_high not_demand not_now not_that not_SUVs not_are not_popular I am a former Ford salesman Yea I sold a couple of Windstars but practicaly had to give them away Before I go in to this I want to say that it did receive a five star safety rating which is the highest a vehicle can receive Very safe well from the impact of another vehicle I was particulary excited to show couples the windstars at the dealership because there were always high bonuses on them I sold a windstar that was a new 1999 model still leftover from a year ago at 6 000 00 under MSRP
Neg,The dealer fixed it under warranty These were adjusted by the dealer under warranty We didnt not_use not_the not_Ford not_dealer not_for not_this not_Saved not_300 The first problem we had was excessive oil consumption We passed on the had to have cooling system flush tire rotation and oil change Saved 300 We had owned a Dodge caravan but swore off them when the transmission failed at 70 k miles The Windstar styling appealed to my wife and the safety features side airbags back up sensor were not not_available not_on not_other not_vans not_of not_that not_year The van is used primarily to carry the kids to school swimming etc Gas mileage is not not_great not_15 not_in not_town not_19 not_highway We had to have another computer update a transmission service and an oil change Cost 350 At 38 k the front brakes had to be serviced Pads and rotors were worn beyond acceptable The problem was never fully explained but we also had to have an update to the computer fuel injector cleaning and an oil change Cost 350 Next the automatic side doors started sticking open At 44 k miles the lower tie rod ends had to be replaced Cost 279 plus the had to have fuel injector cleaning cooling system service and battery test Total cost 500 but after complaining to Ford we got 170 refunded against the tie rods At 34 k miles I wanted the transmission checked as it appeared to take too long to engage when shifting from P or N to D Ford said there was nothing wrong with it and specifications allowed up to a 7 second delay At 48 k the mass air flow sensor and the master cylinder pressure speed switch failed Plus another update to the computer Cost 450 And finally at 50 k the transmission had to be rebuilt Cost 1800 Additionally there is always some little thing going wrong the electric seat the radio speakers the rear wiper etc I like the looks of the van but I will never buy another Ford
Neg,We have a 1990 model Ford Aero Star If you are looking for comfort and a more road compatible vehicle buy yourself a used Aero Star This van is awesome and most comfortable The Windstar has much less head room than the Aero Star This is not not_an not_option not_with not_the not_Windstar not_If not_you not_only not_have not_town not_driving not_to not_contend not_with not_and not_real not_comfort not_isnt not_an not_issue not_buy not_yourself not_a not_Windstar A friend of mine just paid more than 20 000 to try to get the comfort I have in a van almost ten years older and 13 000 cheaper It is much easier to get in and out of the older van than the new one Even with the so called upgrades Ford has established in their newer vans it is apparent they cut too many corners in developing the Windstar Our Aero Star was modified by Qualico with more plush seats and interior courtesy lights for each passenger Even so the Aero Star vans that I have traveled in that are just off the production line are hands down better than the Windstar Aero Star were available with four wheel drive
Neg,It literally fell apart Any car company can do that though The electronics fail all of the time The only thing good about it is the space We bought a 92 Aerostar and as you can guess We had to replace the engine transmission brake stuff and many other vital parts This means that the windows radio ignition lights air etc dont not_work It left us stranded on I 17 200 miles from home with a 4 wheel drive This means that you need a flatbed tow truck so that the gears didnt not_get not_screwed not_up not_Also If you get this car I would suggest getting a cell phone because it is going to leave you stranded The car currently has multiple undetectable flaws that leave us wondering if we bought the wrong car Now We know DO NOT BUY THIS CAR
Neg,Here is where the van becomes extremely dangerous The converter gets extremely hot heating the line up and causing extreme pressure to the lines My mechanic claims this should cause a total design recall on the part of Ford Which eventually causes the line to break at a connection or melt down and explode When towed to a mechanic who specializes in racing cars began working on the brake line we made a shocking discovery These vans could explode and you would not not_only not_lose not_your not_brakes but perhaps your life I am happy to be alive however someone else may not not_be not_so not_lucky My mechanic tried to purchase another line from Ford but they no longer MAKE it While checking the path of why the brake line just blew out my mechanic realized that the brake line is right next to the catalytic converter In 97 I bought a used 95 Windstar Like another complaint listed I also had continual problems with the door ding going off I oiled sprayed and slammed but the ding and light keep going off and have learned to just keep the radio loud enough to ignor it I replace the brakes 4 times in 3 years transmission filter 3 times and Engine and ABS lights kept going on and off When the van hit 100K miles it self destructed Suddenly gas started pouring out of the tailpipe Replaced sparkplugs and wires thinking they may be worn out Gas kept pouring out I was informed by my mechanic it was the fuel injectors at a cost of 129 each 6 plus labor Gas kept pouring out It came down to the computer which is neatly hidden in a 3 hour labor cost to just remove Computer cost 260 plus labor of 900 After 3000 the van ran for two weeks when the whole brake line broke
Neg,It did stop quite smoothly though You did not not_have not_to not_mash not_on not_the not_brakes not_and not_throw not_everyone not_to not_the not_front not_of not_the not_van You can turn twist and do all the maneuvering you want and you still can not not_see not_out not_of not_those not_rear not_windows The vehicle felt too light for being the size it was but then I am used to driving a 5500 lb Caravan But please remember that this was a rental vehicle that we only had for a week I would stick with my Caravan any day The road noise was also quite terrible I felt like I was yelling to the passenger so they could hear me Over all I would not not_purchase not_one not_these It had the get up and go of a snail and the blind spots Boy if you ever wanted to purchase a vehicle with really bad blind spots this would have to be the one The seats were a bit uncomfortable and even in the basic model for being the price they are seemed to be missing quite a few features that you would expect to see like something besides a plastic steering wheel We were rear ended while in our 1996 Dodge Grand Caravan which I love to pieces and had to have it repaired Needing a mini van we ended up with a 2000 Ford Windstar Granted it was the lowest possible model that the rental agency purchases but this van was terrible
Neg,Make it simple Strengths So far so good a year and a half later The only major repair after another 35 000 miles is the steering arm on the front passenger side otherwise just routine maintenance After reading other reviews I guess I cant not_complain not_yet not_The not_dealer not_has not_made not_all not_the not_difference not_so not_far not_they not_have not_treated not_me not_great not_I not_was not_in not_a not_loaner not_car not_for not_several not_days not_while not_the not_transmission not_was not_being not_fixed not_great not_service not_and not_great not_attitude not_from not_the not_service not_team not_so not_far not_and not_its not_been not_the not_only not_reason not_I not_have not_continued not_to not_own not_Ford not_products not_I not_had not_an not_Escort not_station not_wagon not_and not_a not_Ranger not_4x4 not_before not_this not_but not_nothing not_compares not_to not_my not_95 not_Mazda not_626 not_which not_gave not_me not_a not_quarter not_million not_miles not_of not_virtually not_maintenance not_free not_service not_before not_giving not_up not_the not_ghost Huge cargo area with the rear bench seats removed great when we moved Cruise control has been great on long trips gas mileage hovers around 18 mpg highway Weaknesses Transmission has been the biggest problem so far im not not_pleased at the way the resale value is plummeting just 18 months after purchase Book value is half of what I paid for it just 18 months ago with 83 000 miles it may be time to cut my losses and go for a Suburban Also I dont not_like not_the not_fact not_that not_there not_are not_no not_headrests not_on not_the not_rear not_bench not_seats not_SInce not_my not_kids not_are not_small not_I not_didnt not_pay not_attention not_to not_it not_until not_some not_adult not_friends not_came not_along not_for not_the not_ride not_and not_now not_im not_paranoid not_of not_serious not_whiplash not_injuries not_if not_we not_ever not_get not_rear not_ended not_Overall not_im not_getting not_my not_moneys not_worth not_out not_of not_this not_car not_but not_it not_could not_have not_been not_worse not_I not_bought not_it not_used not_with not_45 not_000 not_miles not_on not_it not_and not_the not_dealer not_put not_in not_a not_new not_transmission not_less not_than not_a not_week not_after not_I not_drove not_it not_off not_the not_lot not_Fortunately not_this not_dealer not_offers not_a not_three not_month not_warranty not_on not_any not_used not_car not_so not_it not_did not_not not_cost not_me not_However not_the not_new not_transmission not_failed not_within not_a not_month not_so not_they not_replaced not_two not_sensors not_and not_put not_in not_another not_transmission not_again not_at not_no not_cost
Neg,The fan only had 4 speeds and the 2 lowest fluctuated dramatically This vehicle had only 2400 miles on it im average size man 5 10 When you get out of the van to open the back door its locked very annoying The buttons and temp slide adjustment was very loose I also noticed that the pedals where too close to the drivers seat so the peddals where close the steering wheel was far First thing is I did not not_purchase not_a not_Windstar not_I not_rented not_the not_Windstar not_for not_3 not_days not_After not_the not_1st not_2 not_min not_of not_driving not_this not_vehicle not_I not_instantly not_did not_not not_like not_it not_at not_all not_This was a fairly loaded Windstar the seats were horribly uncomfortable The stereo had very small buttons example was the am fm button Ride was like a boat a lot of swaying from side to side engine noise was abundant and throaty Acceleration was uneven sudden jumps when applying the accelerator Braking was the worst Very mushy and very hard to stop I would not not_recommend not_this not_vehicle not_at not_all not_Go not_purchase not_a not_Chrysler not_Minivan It had powered seats but no matter where I positioned them my top of my back and up had no cushion I can imagine what kind of whipplash I could expect if I was in a accident Next I notice that good ole Ford continues to make cars without a choice of Circulated and Re Circulated ventilation I think all the other car makers do The ventilation system was very weak
Neg,It spent 3 weeks in the shop with no problems found Two weeks later we started the same process with the rear anti lock brake light The wrecker service in this area is on speed dial on my cell phone It has cost me almost twice what I paid for it in mechanical bills So whenever it gets close to the mileage on these parts I just stay close to home I bought this vehicle used in 1995 because I was expecting our first child and the sports car just would not not_do not_any not_longer On my way home from the shop wouldnt you know it the light came on only this time it never went off The shop at our Ford dealer said it was just a sensor gave me the bill for 856 84 and left me there almost in tears There are parts on this vehicle oil pump battery water pump fuel pump that you can count on breaking within a certain number of miles It has the Eddie Bauer package power windows and doors rear window defrost cruise control and a tow package I loved it at first but then after only a year I started having problems with it The check engine light would come on but whenever I stopped it would go off again This was not not_my not_first not_choice not_for not_a not_sports not_utility but at the time the price was right we paid 12 000 00 and it only had 40 000 miles on it It was driven by an older gentlemen who had kept it in excellent condition and had only used the 4 wheel drive in snow It now has 152 000 miles on it I love to drive this type of vehicle when it is running correctly I can see where I am going even in the pouring rain I live out in the boondocks so I really need this type of vehicle to get in my driveway at times I would recommend a sport utility in a heartbeat just not not_this not_particular not_one Three years later I am still driving with this light on as no one can figure out how to fix it To make a long story short we have in 6 years replaced the oil pump 5 times the brakes I couldnt tell you how many times and other items relating to the engine so many times that we finally had it rebuilt in 1999 and I am still having problems with it stalling all the time
Neg,I bought my 1990 Ford Bronco 2 years ago The air conditioner is also being worked on I have replaced the exhaust system It had one owner before me When I got it it ran really great at first The windshield leaks the front of the roof leaks so everytime it rains the inside of my truck gets wet It has a 350 5 8L V8 4X4 I bought it for 5000 00 and have spent that much plus more getting it fixed Any one who has a Bronco I wish them the best of luck I think its time I get something else My engine has 800 00 worth of work to be done I have replaced my left window motor twice and the left door lock motor once It also leaks wear the pedals are It is currently in the shop getting the back brakes replaced plus all of the seals the axle that the brakes destroyed The 4X4 has also had to be replaced I know im forgetting other things I only get 12 mpg and with gas prices the way they are it costs me around 200 00 a month Right now I have 175 000 plus miles and a very big headache I am a little person and feel very safe in this big truck but that is about the only good thing about it DO NOT buy this vehicle
Neg,The truck is just a plain pickup truck nothing fancy The seat slides back and forth and is adjustable The steering handles well and responds to the touch Antilock Brakes There is not not_much not_leg not_room not_between not_the not_dash not_board not_and not_the not_seat The instrument panel is convenient and easy to reach for the driver and passenger There is a third window in the truck that is in the back windshield The Seat has a lumbar support that helps ease the strain riding or driving It is an XLT 2 door regular cab and has a 4 cylinder engine and automatic transmission Features Automatic Steering They work Air Conditioning Cools off quickly Heat takes a little longer to kick in Power Windows There has been a problem with the light that tells you a door is open This window slides back and forth like a sliding glass door Comfort The Seat Belts are adjustable for comfort What is there about the truck that I dont not_like not_I not_will not_try not_to not_be not_fair The bed of the truck is big enough to hold a good size load we have used it to move a daughters furniture It comes on when all the doors are closed and locked I think my husband finally got it fixed It drives more stable to me when it has a load I would not not_use not_this not_truck not_to not_pull not_a not_boat not_and not_trailer The truck is light and feels as if it slides when it is raining If there is a strong wind the truck sways There is only room for two people in this truck there is a third seat belt but it would have to be a small child to ride comfortably What I like I like the way the steering responds I like the safety switch for the airbag What I dont not_like not_I not_do not_not not_like not_the not_way not_it not_handles not_on not_a not_wet not_road We searched for and decided on this truck after the little Isuzu we had conked out We bought this truck with 13000 miles on it This is my husbands truck which I dont not_like not_to not_drive but have to sometimes The noise level of this truck is high to me My husband says it is normal but it still sounds awfully noisy I would not not_buy not_another not_one not_For not_driving not_back not_and not_forth not_to not_work not_and not_hauling not_groceries not_it not_is not_fine not_I not_would not_not not_take not_a not_trip not_in not_it not_to not_the not_mountains The power of this truck is okay to drive on the freeway without getting run over The Ranger drives okay in regular traffic and driving on regular roads Going up a hill or steep bridge it feels like it is straining to keep up speed Times like this is when I wish I had a straight shift This has a neat feature that I wish my van had When the ignition is switched off the button that operates the power windows can be used if the door hasnt been opened I always end up having to put the key back in my van and switching it on to operate the windows Stereo with cassette and CD player Shutoff switch for airbag on passenger side Can only switch on or off with the key This is a great safety feature if you have a small child riding in the passenger seat or a toddler car seat
Neg,They re decent cars Okay im not not_totally not_anti not_Ford not_Explorer But the car was supposedly in excellent shape And I think the Firestone tire thing is not not_a not_major not_concern And the headlights are incredibly bright which is a nice thing if you live in a rural area But the Jeeps computer and the Pathfinders better stereo and related features see my Pathfinder review more than make up for those loses For instance there was a lot of rattling Whenever I got out of the car after driving I could here all sorts of pings and other noises On SUVs handling is the most important thing i e does it feel like a car or a truck and I think Explorers finish last in their class And it drove okay but I constantly felt like I was driving a big truck and would flip on quick turns not not_so on the Pathfinder or the new Jeeps or more expensive SUVs except the Mercedes Explorers have some major positives Keyless entry is great If you have a good deal on a used or new Explorer I am not not_saying not_to not_definitely not_pass not_it not_up not_I not_would not_just not_check not_out not_the not_Pathfinder not_and not_Jeep not_and not_drive not_them not_all not_a not_lot not_around not_curves not_on not_the not_interstate not_before not_you not_pick not_one But the 2000 and 2001 Explorer doesnt handle as well as other cars in its class namely the Jeep Grand Cherokee and the Nissan Pathfinder Its just no comparison Maybe its the one body thing Explorer is put together from different parts rather than molded from one piece of steel All I know is my 2000 Explorer which I sold after 3 months cant not_touch not_my not_new not_2001 not_Pathfinder not_nor not_my not_1998 not_Jeep not_which not_I not_leased not_before not_the not_Explorer And there were other problems
Neg,The explorer started out life in 1990 It was at the time a break through The explorer does everything well for 90 of American drivers The afformentioned room reliability towing ability and resale value have made it a hit here The stock ford stereo is among the worst sound systems I have heard in a modern car It handles much better is roomier and can finally truly compete with the modern crop of SUVs It handled nicely for a truck had lots of room for people pets and cargo and did everything well That 2001 Ford Explorer you may be considering is not not_as not_new not_as not_you not_think not_Sure not_it not_smells not_new not_its not_shiny not_and not_it not_looks not_modern not_but not_the not_mechanicals not_underneath not_are not_anything not_but not_new It is a stereo cassette unit with very bad accoustics and to get normal driving volume the stereo needs to be half way cranked up Spend a little more and go for the all new from the ground up 2002 model The public reacted by making it the best selling sport utility vehicle in the country and ever since it has held that title I can see the practical reasons why Americans hold this SUV so dear after a number of hours behind the wheel of my companys jet black 2001 Explorer 4x4 4 door XLS But I am one of those 10 of Americans who would find the Explorer lacking Compared to new SUVs the explorer feels every bit of 10 years old Dont get me wrong I owned a 1991 explorer for 5 years when it was new and I liked it But compared to newer SUVs the Jeep Grand Cherokee for one the steering feels dead and it handles like a much bigger vehicle
Neg,It was sold for a much nicer Honda Accord And probably by that time you ll need an oxygen mask while you drive I used to have this car Note the used to part The pollution from this thing is tremendous typical of any wonderful Ford Its barely within our States legal limits even brand new The gas mileage is advertised to be between 15 16 for a V8 but it doesnt achieve even that I found that under normal driving conditions I could get maybe 12 miles to a gallon if I was lucky Normally I got 10 or 11 on the average Pretty terrible yes The suspension on this Explorer was horrendous Every time you brake the suspension creaks and groans under the stress I tried to have it fixed while under warranty but nothing could be done Even replacing the entire suspension system did no help Plus the drivers side seatbel The first thing you notice while test driving the 97 Explorer is how bumpy the ride is The shocks are a little too hard even for an SUV Going over speedbumps at 5 mph feels like driving over a boulder in any other car After about 3 days of normal driving you ll have to fill up the gas tank
Neg,In addition the automatic doors are a HUGE safety concern These however are only the problems that they repaired You may think I was unfortunate to get a lemon This makes for a fun toy for the child and a nightmare for the parent In addition the buttons for the automated doors are located within reach of a child The Windstar may be nice looking inside and out but remember looks arent everything It did not not_take not_long not_for not_me not_to not_realize not_that not_I not_had not_made not_a not_terrible not_mistake When we picked up the vehicle we noticed the door did not not_close not_flush not_to not_the not_vehicle To this day the vehicle at times exhibits a surging sensation when going from drive to reverse or vice versa that they can not not_fix If you want to speak to a supervisor you have to wait for them to call you and if you are not not_home you are just out of luck case closed At the time the Windstar had a 5 star safety rating the Odyssey was not not_rated not_The not_Windstar not_was not_readily not_available not_the not_Odyssey not_had not_a not_6 not_week not_wait not_The not_Windstar not_was not_a not_nicer not_looking not_vehicle not_I not_purchased not_the not_Windstar The service department repaired it One month later the car battery died while picking up carpool back to the service department Since that time I have been to the service department for a rear view mirror falling off the gas gauge not not_being not_accurate not_the not_door not_molding not_falling not_off and a clicking noise from the steering column However I have searched the internet and have found a high number of other Windstar owners who are experiencing the same problems that I have encountered I have also read of other owners having the front wheel fall off many electrical problems and I read of a child whos foot was badly injured from the doors If you are considering purchasing this vehicle I suggest you visit www cartrackers com and www edmunds com Look through the forums and town halls and you will be amazed at the number of unhappy Windstar owners I should also mention that Ford Motor Company has one of the worst customer service departments that I have ever come across The Ford dealers will tell you that the automatic doors retract automatically if there is something in the way What they dont not_tell not_you not_is not_that not_you not_need not_to not_exhibit not_force not_against not_the not_door not_for not_it not_to not_do not_this not_For not_an not_adult not_this not_can not_be not_done not_although not_I not_have not_been not_bruised not_before not_however not_a not_small not_child not_can not_easily not_be not_injured I am a Mother of 3 small children who decided the time had come to purchase a minivan After reading as many car magazines as I could get my hands on I narrowed the search to the Ford Windstar SEL and the Honda Odyssey EX Both of these models were new for 1999 and they were the only ones who offered automatic doors a seemingly great feature for a mother with small kids
Neg,We had reserved a mini van on the Big Island My family of 5 traveled to Hawaii for a vacation I will be upfront with you from the beginning and tell you that I am not not_a not_Ford not_fan But that has nothing to do with the opinion I am about to write There were some good points about it Like I said at the beginning it is a nice looking vehicle it does drive nice and I particularly liked the rear controlled air conditioning Of course we didnt not_know not_what not_we not_d not_get not_we not_were not_willing not_to not_take not_whatever not_they not_gave not_us not_at not_the not_rental not_agency not_Ford not_GM not_Toyota not_whatever not_Well not_they not_gave not_us not_a not_Ford not_Windstar not_which not_was not_fine We asked for something different but they didnt not_have not_anything not_available not_Since not_we not_d not_already not_paid not_for not_it not_before not_our not_vacation not_we not_didnt not_have not_the not_heart not_to not_walk not_away not_and not_try not_a not_different not_rental not_agency not_I not_do not_know not_that not_in not_the not_future not_I not_wont not_rent not_or not_buy not_a not_Ford not_Windstar Had no trouble getting it on the planes in fact we didnt not_max not_out not_our not_limits not_there not_Next not_problem not_was not_the not_first not_time not_the not_driver not_opened not_the not_drivers not_door not_he not_wacked not_himself not_on not_the not_head not_because not_the not_door not_kind not_of not_curves not_down not_and not_in not_making not_it not_so not_you not_have not_to not_pay not_attention not_every not_time not_you not_open not_the not_door When we walked to the van it was a nice looking van and we thought this would be a nice experience to get over some of our dislike for past Ford products we ve had bad experiences with First problem was we couldnt even fit all of our luggage into the hatchback area some of it had to go into the back seat with one person sitting there Yes I know we could pack lighter but believe me we were within reasonable limits No stitches were involved but he did have a nasty looking cut for the duration of our trip Next problem is that the middle seat in the back doesnt go all the way to the edge of the vehicle like the Astro or Safaris do so the adults who were riding in the middle seat had difficulty getting in and out comfortably and when you are sightseeing there is a lot of getting in and out And my last complaint has nothing to do with Ford but we had to laugh when we left the rental agency in Kona flew to Honolulu to rent another van for a week and got another Windstar
Neg,The sound system is good though It has done great in safety tests Also theres no longer a door lock for the automatic lock at the rear door The good thing is that it does have rear doors on both sides now Also it does ride well after the 1st 5000 miles and its great for long highway trips You should buy this vehicle if you have never had a mini van before you will love it because you wont have any comparison The bad thing is that you can only enter the second rear seat from one side it would be very helpful to enter from both sides And for the money its probably one of the best values you can get Even though I dont not_love not_the not_car not_I not_will not_say not_its not_not not_a not_totally not_awful not_car If I had never purchased the 98 I would probably think its great We originally leased a 1998 Ford Windstar and LOVED it We then turned it in at the end of the lease and bought a 1999 Windstar anticipating we d enjoy it also HATED IT First of all it doesnt look as sleek as the 98 Secondly it sometimes rides like a truck not not_a not_car After the wonderful experience of the 98 I dont not_understand not_what not_happened not_with not_the not_99 not_It not_doesnt not_have not_as not_much not_room not_as not_the not_98 not_either
Neg,It is noisy We like the controls What we like The manufacturer claims 17 city 23 highway What we dont not_like The automatic doors occasionally dont not_work The handle placement is VERY POORLY DESIGNED It has a very nice albeit noisy ride We bought our 1999 Windstar SE in August 1999 We love the dual remote controlled sliding doors This is basically an SEL without the two tone paint It is a very nice looking van in our opinion We ve had this car for 3 5 years now The salesman did it though and the door opened back up We had the transmission reprogrammed and it doesnt clunk anymore We didnt not_want not_to not_wait not_3 not_months not_or not_pay not_over not_invoice Not in terms of squeaks and rattles but general road noise poor insulation This might seem petty but it is driving me crazy We looked at the Windstar the Honda Odyssey the Nissan Quest and the Dodge Caravan We decided on the Windstar even though we would have preferred the Odyssey The only option we didnt not_add was the backing up sensors the beeping thing The rear air stopped working and luckily that turned out to be a fuse It drives a lot like my 1998 Honda Accord did I replaced the Accord with the Windstar However last summer we had to replace the entire steering system at a cost of about 1 400 It also shifts from reverse to drive with a clunk and sometimes a lurch UPDATE 1 11 04 It has about 38 000 miles on it Most of our complaints repairs have been nuisances My older son likes to sit in the way back and I can barely hear him talking They cant not_fix not_it not_because not_it not_always not_seems not_to not_work not_when not_we not_take not_it not_to not_the not_shop It is very easy to get my 2 kids in and out of 10 months old and 2 1 2 years old The dealer said there is nothing wrong with it Its not not_my not_driving not_though not_because not_I not_get not_15 not_mpg not_in not_my not_husbands The cruise control from the beginning has only worked when it wants to work not not_necessarily when we want it to work We ended up with a completely loaded woodland green SE model because at the end of the 1999 model year the only SEL we could find was gold We have not not_had not_this not_car not_in not_for not_repairs yet we ve had it 6 months but I have heard some weird transmission noises when putting in reverse We are in the process of trying to sell this car as we have replaced it with a 2004 Honda Pilot which we absolutely LOVE The windshield washer button is on the end of the blinker control I cant not_tell not_you not_how not_many not_times not_ive not_washed not_the not_windshield not_while not_turning not_the not_corner not_LOL It is quieter than the Caravan though I slammed the middle two fingers of my right hand in the passenger sliding door the first time I closed it from the inside Tahoe which has a huge V 8 engine and weighs twice as much While this is not not_necessarily not_a not_bad not_minivan not_I not_would not_not not_buy not_this not_car not_again im already wishing for a new one They are very logically placed and if you have a large drink in the drink holder it doesnt block the radio or other controls the Quest was the worst for this We like the looks If you dont not_completely not_wrap not_your not_fingers not_around not_the not_handle not_WATCH not_OUT not_when not_you not_close not_the not_door not_from not_the not_inside not_im not_afraid not_to not_close not_it not_now not_ive not_never not_gotten not_more not_than not_15 not_miles not_per not_gallon and I drive 80 highway My two year old loves to play with the buttons so for now we have it turned off on the main control and I only use the remote for it right now im concerned too about safety I stuck the large plastic key holder box at the dealership in the door as it closed and it dented it I have VERY small hands and no way would I test it with my hand Not worth the risk
Neg,Now I always check before exiting The horn is difficult to use This time I went to another Ford dealer in the next town In damp weather the plastic panels squeak Rear licence plate shield light holders broke off Other poor points Radio cuts out when a passenger gets into van Once the weather warmed up in 2001 the pinging started again with the second engine Once the weather warmed up the engine began to ping premature detonation of fuel mixture at 1800 RPM It took over a week to have a replacement recycled engine installed and the Ford dealer would NOT provide a loaner When this happens the power windows are still live this appears to have drained the battery several times The roof on Windstars has a strange seam on either side which appears to be filled with a hard putty This is annoying when listening the news in a parking lot Radio sometimes stays on when driver removes key and leaves van They wouldnt not_replace not_the not_hood and would only repaint it Three days later I arrived home with the new Windstar a paint job and 12 miles on the odometer The paint soon cracks on this material Rear speakers are intermittent because of poorly designed spring loaded contacts on sliding doors I often clean them to get the rear speakers to work This dealer was excellent and within two visits have almost eliminated the ping by recalibrating the processor and installing a new style valve cover which has an additional baffle to prevent oil vapors from being burnt Huge turning circle makes these vans cumberson to park in tight locations Good points Good safety rating Heating and air conditioning works well Nice safe orange rear turn signals instead of confusing red ones Engine is quite powerful but harsh if working hard Fuel economy is actually not not_bad not_on not_long not_highway not_runs Fortunately I did not not_pay not_for not_this not_minivan not_I not_took not_delivery not_of not_it not_in not_April not_1999 not_as not_my not_company not_vehicle not_ive not_driven not_company not_vehicles not_since not_1973 not_and not_have not_looked not_after not_them not_as not_if not_they not_were not_my not_own not_I not_have not_always not_purchased not_them not_afterwards not_but not_this not_Windstar not_will not_probably not_be not_the not_first not_exception not_in not_28 not_years I heard all sorts of reasons from its your ashtray to you must have had the van gassed up while playing the radio this corrupts its processor I had it in 7 times for this pinging until in September 2000 the engine rattled so bad that it clunked to a standstill totally seized at 25 000 miles When I drove it home from the dealer and parked in my driveway the hood looked like had condensation on it Unfortunately this was such a poor paint job it looked like someone had used an aerosol paint can to do it I immediately took it back to the dealer where I was met with complete indifference and was told to take it round the back to the collision centre You must first find the seam on the large airbag cover as its the only part that will sound the horn quite dangerous Windshield appears to have a badly shaped area right in front of the driver which wont clean properly in icy weather Seats are rather thin and small I was in Europe recently and my small econobox car over there had proper seats that actually were wide and comfortable The Windstar has lots of wasted space either side of the seats
Neg,Has anyone else had similar problems It was as though I had downshifted to 1 When the light turned green the car operated normally If so did you avail yourself of the Lemon Law Did Ford offer a financial incentive to purchase another Ford product The dealer in Tampa replaced several computer transmission parts and assured me that everything was ok Three weeks later it did it again Three and one half weeks later the transmission arrived and seemed to be ok The second week I noted that the transmission abruptly downshifted at about 42 miles per hour and slowed very quickly even though I was accelerating In January 2000 we were left sitting in a busy intersection when the car refused to go and then in 15 20 seconds surged into traffic The Ford dealer contacted the regional rep and they promised me a new transmission in one week I purchased a 1999 Windstar in November 1998 Initially the car operated perfectly However at 10 200 miles the car locked up while in drive and nothing I could do would get it to move After about 25 seconds the car surged forward very fast and I had to slam on the brakes to keep from hitting a car crossing in front The dealer gained access to a tech bulletin and adjusted the transmission Today I drove and found that the transmission does not not_downshift not_at not_42 not_MPH not_it not_downshifts not_at not_53 not_miles not_per not_hour not_So not_much not_for not_Ford not_tech not_bulletins not_so not_much not_for not_Reliability not_is not_job not_one not_I not_have not_written not_complaints not_to not_and not_called not_the not_NHTSB not_and not_they not_have not_done not_nothing not_I not_have not_called not_Ford not_several not_times not_without not_success The dealer could find nothing wrong with the car Upon moving to Alabama in July the car repeated the lock up I explained to the dealer that it was a safety issue and that I could be killed if I accelerated from a stop sign and the car refused to move for 20 seconds and then surged into traffic Again they could find nothing wrong and there were no tech bulletins from Ford addressing such a problem
Neg,updated Jan 03 Hello all an update to my windstar review is required The car seats and my husband could not not_fit not_in not_our not_car not_anymore We had to upgrade our car to a bigger car a SUV or a Mini Van We purchased the LX model with 2 doors one of which is an automatic door For the additional money we spent on it I was leary of it However its fantastic We all fit very comfortably in it My husband can finally drive a car without his knees being in his chest Also they sell a cargo net but really they should include it for safety so that bag of canned goods wont fall on our feet The only place he cannot not_fit is BEHIND the 2nd bench row But even when he is sitting in the second row he is very comfortable We tried numerous SUVs but none of them in our price range around 25 k could fit my husband with the seat all the way back and the infant carrier Until we got to the Windstar Then I saw someone driving the 1999 Ford Windstar and I fell in love I sent my husband to look at them and he fell in love Why First off let me explain that we have 2 children one in a booster seat and one in an infant seat Plus my husband is 6 feet 6 inches How many times do the kids run to the car to wait for you to open the doors not not_anymore not_just not_press not_the not_button and they can get in and start getting buckled in I have found that my mini van is getting excellent

it actually gets corrected yet the service people never fail to remind me that the most important thing to them is getting an excellent rating on any survey card i receive afterwords yeah like thats

Neg,The vehicle that I am reviewing is a 1999 Ford Windstar mini van The average gas mileage is 15 MPG with most of the miles on the freeway Other than this being underpowered the roominess and creature comforts are average If this van is to be used in a commercial operation the Chevy ASTRO would be a better choice This vehicle would be an OK choice if its primary chore was toting junior to soccer or mom to the supermarket The engine revs up and it sounds powerful but alas you can not not_see not_the not_speedometer not_climb not_faster This is a company leased vehicle that is presently assigned to me while my new Crown Vic is on order This van is as underpowered as the three Aerostar vans that preceded it This van has the ability to SOUND like it is picking up speed but it is only an illusion
Neg,There is no leg room and the trunk area is pretty small The van drove like a tank and did not not_have not_many not_extra not_features There were two main sources of noise the road and the vents There were five of us and we were all squished together The engine I think it was a V 6 was underpowered and took a lot to accelerate There is a ton of wasted space up by the dash board and the seats are smaller so they could put in drink holders Also for a new van the air conditioning barely worked Overall I was really disappointed in the car but I have come to expect that from Ford I will never rent a Ford car or van again When I went on vacation with my girlfriend and her family to Washington DC from Milwaukee they rented a Ford Winstar to drive there Well that was a huge mistake First of all the minivan is really crampt Once we got on the road we found out how loud the van was I sat in the back of the van and I could not not_even not_talk not_to not_the not_person not_in not_the not_front not_because not_the not_car not_was not_so not_loud The vents are on the ceiling and let out this loud hissing noise whenever they are on Also we couldnt listen to the radio because there no speakers in the back and we couldnt hear the front speakers over all of the other noise
Neg,The first week we had it the lights began to flicker inside The first being the one that never has a problem and has grateful owners That luckily was replaced free under the warranty Within a few weeks came a new problem This rebuild job is to cost me over 1600 00 No I will not not_be not_repairing not_anything not_else not_on not_the not_van So when it was time to trade in the old van I jumped at the chance to get my 1999 Windstar I loved it the moment my mom drove up in her new Windstar I said my next van would be just like it but in white And the second being the 1999 Windstars that got all the problems they could pack into one vehicle Guess which one we bought We assumed that a door was ajar but the warning light was not not_illuminating not_We not_found not_out not_it not_was not_one not_of not_the not_many not_sensors not_inside not_the not_door As my transmission was shifting rather hard I asked the dealer what it could be I was then informed that the 1999 Windstar is notorious for having transmission troubles This did not not_help not_at not_all and the vibration was just getting worse Just when I thought nothing else could go wrong I found out that it could The service engine light continually comes on and no amount of times that we have it on the expensive computer to test it they can find no valid reason for the problem It is going to be a trade in just as soon as possible I have heard from others who have this year Windstar that there are two types of 1999 Windstars It had low miles just under 36 000 and still had a bit of warranty left on it Sad to say it just wasnt not_enough not_time not_to not_find not_out not_what not_was not_truly not_wrong not_with not_my not_newly not_acquired not_vehicle The back windshield wiper would work only if you slammed the back hatch door Another sensor is what I was told and that bill was on me We replaced the sensor yet a few weeks later it was on the blink again This time it was as we were informed a faulty switch and would cost us to repair it Needless to say we dont not_have not_a not_back not_wiper not_at not_the not_moment not_Soon not_after not_this not_I not_noticed not_that not_my not_rear not_view not_mirrors not_were not_vibrating not_while not_we not_were not_driving not_down not_the not_road not_Figuring not_it not_was not_in not_need not_of not_balancing not_I not_had not_the not_tires not_and not_alignment not_done
Neg,It is actually my moms van shes been really taking good care of it 15 months only 8000 miles We bought the van last jan 99 my mom was suppose to get an odyssey minivan but we had to wait for about 3 to 6 months which we should have done First of all I would like everyone to know that this is my first time in epinions because i want everyone to know what problems we ve been having wih our 99sel Its been to the dealer a lot of times with different problems first one we noticed blemishes on left rear behind the sliding door no quality control noticed a big blemish like that which was impossible to miss Then it started doing it again so back to the dealer they adjusted it again now it got worse you could hear it scratching something inside the railing so now were up to the point of getting tired of this problem Now they are gonna change the two sliding doors if it s still not not_fixed not_then not_I not_think not_it not_is not_a not_lemon not_Because not_I not_think not_this not_vans not_were not_the not_first not_batch not_to not_come not_out not_thats not_why not_it not_has not_all not_this not_problems not_onna not_have not_to not_call not_ford not_soon The dealer where we got the van had it brought to a bodyshop no problem with dealership they were nice amp helpful it took about 2 days then we got it back that was fixed then the electronic display on the van was reporting that theres a charging problem so we goback to the dealer it was the alternator so now they have to replace the alternator so this was solved And now the biggest problem THE AUTOMATIC SLIDING DOOR one day it just wont shut tight it closes but it opens up a little bit on both doors so another visit to the dealer they adjusted it so it was ok for a while
Neg,It looked terrific I bought an extended warranty I bought the vehicle when it was 1 year old and had 32000 miles My actions speak louder than anything I could write I meant to keep this van for 10 years but it was so bad I dumped it after a year and a half Other issues that I did not not_try not_to not_fix not_Squeaks not_thumps bumps rattles plastic interior pieces that got warped by the sun gaskets falling off all the time around doors overall sloppy assembly and bad fit and finish In that year and a half I had to do the following Replace the rear window motor Replace the Tires Replace the Brakes 700 00 4 Safety related recalls Replace the front windshield wiper motor Replace a heater vent damper 300 00 mostly labor or I wouldnt not_have not_heat not_Check not_engine not_light came on they replaced the valve cover with a revised design Two weeks later the Check Engine Light came on again this time they replaced the Intake manifold gasket with a revised design plus a bunch of other emission control stuff that apparently got ruined by the bad gasket Even though Ford paid for a portion of a couple of these repairs under the warranty I had to pay deductibles pay for rental cars they only had a loaner once and only helped defray one of the rentals once and the majority of all repairs was not not_covered not_by not_the not_warranty not_I not_spent not_several not_thousand not_dollars not_to not_keep not_the not_vehicle not_running not_over not_the not_course not_of not_a not_year not_and not_a not_half
Neg,The first problem was a wiring issue This has been a KNOWN problem for years We bought our 1999 Windstar LX used towards the end of my pregnancy with our third child They found that there were wires that had apparently been cut under the dashboard It had died on me on my way home we had to have it towed The first 8 months went by without incident but since then we have had nothing but problems Ironically it all started immediately following recall service This is our first minivan wanted to make sure it was well rated and safe so we did a lot of checking around They say the customer service is supposed to be improving but I dont not_believe not_selling not_cars not_that not_they not_know not_have not_problems not_is not_good not_customer not_service This was not not_covered not_being not_that not_we not_found not_out not_then not_our not_warranty not_had not_expired not_not not_by not_mileage not_but not_years not_we not_were not_told not_by not_the not_salesman not_we not_had not_1 not_year not_almost not_18 not_000 not_miles not_left not_As not_I not_was not_driving not_home not_from not_picking not_it not_up not_from not_that not_service not_I not_noticed not_the not_check not_engine not_light not_was not_on not_Upon not_checking not_my not_manual not_when not_returning not_home not_it not_said not_to not_drive not_the not_vehicle not_through not_3 not_cycles not_before not_taking not_it not_for not_service not_I not_did not_that not_found not_out not_a not_week not_later not_that not_we not_had not_an not_oxygen not_sensor not_that not_needed not_to not_be not_replaced Also not not_covered not_I not_did not_at not_least not_get not_them not_to not_take not_the not_diagnostic not_charge not_off not_being not_that not_whoever not_test not_drove not_it not_after not_the not_service not_should not_have not_seen not_the not_check not_engine not_light not_Anyway not_moving not_on not_next not_there not_was not_the not_idle not_problem not_I not_could not_start not_the not_car not_it not_would not_run not_as not_long not_as not_I not_had not_my not_foot not_on not_the not_gas not_pedal not_Apparently not_a not_valve not_was not_getting not_stuck not_open not_had not_to not_be not_replaced not_Immediately not_after not_this not_problem not_was not_fixed not_I not_traveled not_to not_Georgia not_to not_visit not_friends not_upon not_trying not_to not_return not_home not_my not_transmission not_went not_out not_At not_30 not_000 not_miles not_Luckily not_the not_only not_thing not_that not_happened not_is not_that not_the not_overdrive not_light not_started not_flashing not_after not_being not_on not_the not_highway not_for not_a not_few not_minutes not_I not_returned not_to not_my not_friends not_house not_I not_have not_read not_about not_incidents not_where not_the not_van not_accelerates not_on not_its not_own not_or not_takes not_off not_into not_reverse not_2 not_weeks not_after not_trying not_to not_go not_home not_and not_a not_lot not_of not_stress not_I not_made not_it not_home not_with not_my not_infant not_2 not_sons not_just not_in not_time not_for not_school not_to not_start not_I not_got not_the not_dealer not_to not_cover not_half not_of not_the not_costs not_they not_have not_hidden not_warranties not_they not_dont not_tell not_you not_about not_called not_p05 not_and not_p07 not_but not_it not_was not_still not_1200 not_Needless not_to not_say not_I not_will not_not not_only not_never not_buy not_another not_Ford not_but not_I not_would not_strongly not_agree not_with not_others not_stating not_how not_awful not_Ford not_customer not_service not_is not_Do not_a not_search not_on not_the not_internet not_about not_Windstars not_you not_will not_find not_as not_much not_information not_on not_transmission not_steering not_rack not_problems not_as not_you not_do not_for not_the not_Caravans
Neg,That is very aggravating and distracting More worrisome at highway speeds the steering was awful and very mushy for lack of a better word You could turn the wheel almost a quarter of a turn with no response and then the van would lurch the direction you were turning Every now and then the transmission would slip just a little It may not not_be not_as not_comfortable but I have no doubt I can be driving it in ten years with well over a hunred thousand miles on it If you are thinking about a Windstar beware It was a nice van with only 46000 miles on it Luckily I went on a Saturday afternoon and an agreement was reached where I would drive it over Sunday Easter and come back to finalize the deal on Monday My girlfriend loved the ride as well and was sold on that aspect of the van However as we began our drive for Easter dinner the mechanical nature of the van began to show First the sensors for the doors that had just beeped and flashed when we hit hard bumps began beeping and flashing for almost any bump or curve On the test drive with the dealer it did fine except for the door sensors dinging whenever we hit a big bump I was told that was common and would be cleaned and fixed I really enjoyed the comfort of the drivers chair it was truly like being in my living room chair and the ergonomics of the controls were great I was shopping for a new vehicle and wanted something bigger I thought I wanted a mini van it had to have room for kids and dogs and lots of stuff I did a few some quick polling of people and realized that no matter what brand they were either loved or hated I went to a local dealer and found a 1999 Ford Windstar LX The brakes gave once or twice as we were sitting at a stop light Luckily I had not not_paid not_for not_the not_thing not_yet and was able to return it I did a lot more reading that night and found out all of these problems were rather common in a Windstar I took the beast back to the dealer on Monday morning and drove home in an older Nissan Pathfinder with more miles
Neg,It whent out around 60 K It was worse than normal The transsmisson usually shifts smothly Handling Fine The CD Cassette delivered pleanty of good rich sound Reliablity We Bought our 1999 Windstar in December of 2000 The interior was nicley appointed but looked like it was done on the cheap The tires where also cheap but I blame that on the dealers replacements It had a good radio and good a c and comfertably fit a family of 6 Drivetrain The dealer had put Ameri General tires on it We replaced them with a good set of Dunlops The rear a c worked well the seats where comfertable for road trips and my family never complained It does become a bit hard to handle in an emergancy situation but its fairly easy to control It brakes ok Interior Cheap Several small plastic bits fell off and the rear a c control fell out during hard braking The 3 8 V 6 has plenty of get up and go It gets 17 around towan and 23 on the interstate Here is my complaint and why we no longer have this van Ford doesnt make good trannies and this one was no exception It had 26 000 miles on it We bargiend with the dealer and got a 6 year 120K warrenty too First Impression We liked the Deep Red Like a good wine hence the name Dark Cabernet Red Fortunatly the extended warrenty picked that up Plus it had numorus electrical issues the interior was falling apart and it just wasnt not_well not_built not_I not_had not_all not_the not_usual not_Windstar not_problems not_do not_a not_little not_reserch not_like not_Car not_Trackers and you ll see what I mean I wouldnt not_reccomend not_this not_to not_any not_one
Neg,This is the mini vans weakness It even has power lumbar supports for both front seats Here is my evaluation in several areas of the vehicle Handling The transmission is smooth when it is working properly This vehicle has anti lock brakes front and side air bags a five star crash rating all around Thats how my wife and I have been feeling lately Of course this expensive repair at 1200 happened when my original factory warranty ended The only weakness here is that the second row Captains chairs are not not_moveable not_to not_one not_side They move up similar to cars that only have two doors You could almost live in the Captains chairs that are standard in this vehicle The dealership denied my claim for warranty service even though the original factory warranty was 36 months 36 000 miles At the time Hondas mini van did not not_offer not_leather not_seating not_unless not_you not_went not_to not_an not_aftermarket not_place not_to not_have not_it not_done not_Ingress not_Egress The problem is that Ford uses low quality materials to produce their transmissions and the replacement parts of course are of a high quality material One time I had to have the cable that closes the drivers side power sliding door be replaced because the cable actually broke It was one of the first minivans to obtain this safety rating Now its newest competitors from Honda Toyota and Mazda have the same five star safety ratings Summary The power steering in this vehicle is somewhat too boosted for my taste which means numb road feel I have the sense of being detached from the road It is a four speed automatic with overdrive that you can defeat for those long uphill climbs so that the transmission will not not_have not_to not_hunt not_for not_the not_right not_gear not_to not_use My transmission failure happened at the 40th month of ownership I also found out later I was one of three 1999 Windstars that the local transmission shop was working on for the same problem It is fine for the family that needs to rent one to use for a special trip but over the long haul be prepared to pay the price for a Fix Or Repair Daily FORD This mini van can compete easily with its competitors on drivability handling comfort and interior features but unfortunately has a poor reliability experience for me I am very hesitate to recommend this vehicle to anyone because of the reliability issue Which was a good thing because as time went on I would have to use the money I saved to the repairs that were needed to be done after the warranty expired The problem I experienced with the transmission was at 29 511 miles into the use of the mini van I had to rebuild the transmission Yes I had to have the transmission rebuilt It is very similar to all the competitors out there My van had the upgraded suspension and 16 alloy wheels Going through turns at speed elicits some body roll but that is to be expected for a tall vehicle Turning radius could be better Both Toyota and Honda bests the Ford in this measurement This was the first year Ford introduced an additional sliding door on the drivers side Auto headlight feature interior child light fake wood trim tinted windows Separate A C and heating compressors for the front and rear passengers baby view mirror garage door coin and cupholders security alarm and auto anti glare rearview mirror The EPA rating of 19 city and 23 highway is right on target Luckily this mini van uses regular unleaded unlike the Honda and Toyota which recommend premium Gas tank size is a very large 26 gallons for a great cruising range Insuring this vehicle is similar to all of its competitors fairly inexpensive Safety As I said in detail above in the drivetrain section I had to have the transmission rebuilt Recently I had to have the drivers door handle plus internal mechanism replaced because Ford uses plastic parts for this high use area to ensure replacement Economy Gas mileage in this vehicle is on par with other mini vans Wind noise is subdued only engine noises when revved is somewhat loud Even today the mini van doesnt emit any squeaks or rattles Interior Features Power seats for both driver and passenger seats with power lumbar supports Leather seating AM FM Stereo Cassette with CD On Board Diagnostic Computer with outside temperature and compass power mirrors power windows keyless entry with remote open closing of sliding doors The only thing missing is memory seating Seven people definitely can fit in this vehicle more comfortably than the Toyota but is about the same in the Honda Long trips in any of the seats will not not_elicit not_lower not_back not_pains not_Freeway not_driving not_elicits not_71 not_dB not_on not_my not_sound not_level not_meter not_For not_comparison not_the not_Toyota not_and not_the not_Honda not_both not_registered not_70dB The suspension absorbs large and small bumps very well to the point of almost feeling like being in a large cruise ship 0 60 in this mini van is approximately 9 5 seconds making it one of the fastest minivans available Much of the credit for the handling can be derived from the use of the Windstar platform actually using the Taurus platform Comfort This is an update from a review I previously done almost two years ago First my wife and I test drove several of the competitors at the time before we decided on the Ford Windstar SEL Because I had a friend who was a Fleet Manager at one of the Ford dealerships I was able to purchase this vehicle for thousands of dollars less If you are like me and have two kids in car seats and they take up the second row it is difficult for adults to enter the third row to sit You may want to choose the second row as a bench seat so that passengers will have room to sit in the third row more easily Getting in the drivers seat or front passenger seat is very easy because of the large doors and low step in height which is similar to most large passenger automobiles Drivetrain When I saw the pinion gears they looked like they had over 100 000 miles of wear on them A design problem that contributed to this is that the transmission is from the Ford Taurus A transmission designed for a vehicle that weighs 800 lbs less than the Windstar Reliability Here is what I had to have worked on since the 3 5 years of ownership Four times I had to have the power sliding doors repaired because they always popped back open during a hot day Even today it still happens from time to time
Neg,Let me tell you all a story He tells me that he has to speak to the Ford regional rep When I picked up the van from the dealer I noticed a large tear in the carpet How can this be you ask after all dealers prep is always charged I dont not_know He said he would call the rep and get back to me never did even after 3 requests It seems that one of the pistons that support the door went bad and had to be replaced So now back it goes again where they keep it for 4 more days and decide they have to order a new transmission Now im not not_cutting not_down not_all not_Ford not_products but I am telling you that Ford and Freehold Ford DO NOT give a damn about their customers They keep it for 5 days and give it back saying its fixed but guess what Still leaks and the door still isnt not_operating not_properly You can decide for yourself if you would consider purchasing this vehicle from this dealer or any other I leased my 99 Windstar about a year and a half ago from Freehold Ford in New Jersey Yes finally I have had enough I go to the manager of Freehold Ford and explain everything that has gone on and tell him I want out of the lease You would think that with ford in the papers and the news every day getting negative press that they would be a little inclined to show the world that the bad publicity isnt not_all not_true not_Decide not_for not_yourself They will call me when it comes in That process takes almost 2 months in which while I am waiting the power steering goes and the interior power door button falls out and wont go back They agreed that it would have to be replaced and ordered the carpet I was also missing 1 of the original keys which they told me they had but never produced so I had to bring the van in so they could make a key Time to order a new one and another day in the shop A few more months go by and now the power sliding door doesnt always work the rear interior light fell out and wont stay put and the reverse sensors have stopped working I bring the van back to Freehold Ford once again and leave it for a few days to be repaired Everything is repaired but they cant not_find not_a not_problem not_with not_the not_door not_Now not_I not_have not_it not_and not_the not_door not_still not_only not_operates not_when not_it not_wants not_to not_Some not_more not_time not_goes not_by not_and not_the not_transmission not_is not_now not_leaking not_I not_bring not_it not_back not_again Ok the new carpet is ready so I bring it in leave it for 2 days and then pick it up When I look at it the carpet appears to have been installed by a blind man no offense to the blind I tell them and now I have to leave it another day to fix that Well thats all taken care of but the sun is out and my wife lowers the visor which then proceeds to drop and dangle as if hanging from a thread now they order a new visor and when it arrives I have to leave the van another day so they can replace it A few months go by and I open the rear hatch door which proceeds to fall on my head He will get back to me He then informs me that the rep told him he will not not_get not_me not_out not_of not_the not_lease not_because not_these not_are not_minor not_problems not_and not_the not_lemon not_law not_does not_not not_apply not_I not_also not_call not_Ford not_customer not_dis not_service not_myself not_and not_besides not_being not_totally not_useless not_a not_few not_of not_the not_reps not_were not_so not_rude not_I not_wanted not_to not_strangle not_them not_Now not_the not_trans not_is not_in not_so not_I not_leave not_the not_van not_again not_for not_4 not_days not_Current not_situation not_is not_no not_transmission not_leak not_power not_steering not_not not_operating not_properly not_and not_the not_power not_sliding not_door not_still not_operates not_whenever not_it not_wants not_to not_i not_called not_Ford not_again not_and not_was not_told not_by not_the not_rep not_to not_do not_whatever not_you not_feel not_you not_have not_to not_do not_I not_asked not_the not_manager not_of not_Freehold not_Ford not_if not_I not_could not_speak not_to not_the not_rep not_myself
Neg,The exterior is beautiful in my opinion and the color choices are many The downfall is the interior im not not_a not_leather not_seat not_person and the SEL only comes with leather seats not not_heated The dashboard has your typical american car look about it The rear seat fold down very easily I must say We bought this vehicle 6 months ago after the birth of my second child and felt the need for a little more room I have to admit I bought the car because it looks good The ride is smooth but loud as most Fords are But it serves its purpose for our family Room for all and lots of trunk space I just dont not_feel not_we not_had not_to not_spend not_30 not_000 not_for not_that
Neg,So while the car was getting fixed the nearby dealership gave us a rental Those things dont not_pose not_a not_big not_problem not_though not_because not_the not_visibility not_is not_great not_especially not_with not_all not_the not_glass not_and not_there not_is not_tons not_of not_head not_room The floor pan is low and that makes the Ford Windstar easy to get in and out of The only thing that disappointed me with this van was the amount of standard features The story begins when we rented a 1999 Ford Windstar LX because our 1998 Nissan Maxima was in the shop for a routine check up then a mechanic went to park the car and had a 5mph run in with a garage wall We had it for a week and loved it despite all the articles in Consumer Reports telling potential buyers not not_to not_buy not_this not_vehicle not_we not_had not_a not_pleasant not_time not_with not_it not_When not_you not_get not_in not_and not_drive not_the not_vehicle not_you not_cant not_help not_but not_notice not_its not_size not_at not_201 not_in not_but not_I not_am not_not not_just not_talking not_about not_its not_length not_I not_am not_also not_talking not_about not_the not_height not_of not_this not_vehicle not_66 not_5 not_in The simplest things like a CD player center console and standard middle captains chairs would have been nice and probably got us to buy a Windstar but because the lack of standard features for the price we will just stick with the Maxima Lastly if you dont not_mind not_paying not_30 not_000 not_for not_a not_van not_with not_less not_standard not_equipment not_than not_a not_Grand not_Caravan not_or not_Grand not_Voyager not_and not_having not_questionable not_reliability not_then the 1999 Ford Windstar is the van for you
Neg,The engine noise is most noticeable in hotter weather conditions The hotter it is the louder it is My 99 Windstar is a great van to haul my family of 5 The highest Octane works best but can you imagine my gas expenses for a van rated for 87 Octane As far as fuel economy goes 19 MPG is all I can get out of my van The noise is annoying and I believe will result in major engine repairs in the future as it seems to get progressively worst It rattles at cruising speeds during accelerations and whenever it feels like it ive used all three different gas octanes and I still have the noise In my opinion there is a mechanical flaw but I cant not_convince not_the not_Dealer not_or not_Ford not_of not_it not_I not_also not_noticed not_on not_this not_web not_site not_that not_others not_have not_indicated not_an not_engine not_noise not_in not_their not_opinions not_as not_well The exception is a Engine Spark Knock noise I first noticed it at about 7 000 miles currently at 17 000 ive been back to the dealer five times now and each time they say its normal unless the noise is heard during cruising speeds
Neg,The same 1 3 liter SOHC 4 cylinder engine has been used since introduction The wheels are also very small 13 so this exacerbates this unattractive egg theme Ford offers 2 transmissions for the

demise in 1997 The 1997 Ford Aspire is rated at 34 city 42 highway yet I observed around 28 city and 32 highway this significantly lower observed rating is undoubtedly due to the optional 3 speed

Neg,In 1997 I was the proud owner of a 1992 Ford Tempo GLS 4 door sedan The seats were made of cloth and offered little support or comfort no bolstering whatsoever Where was the 4 speed automatic option Even the 92 Ford Escort had a 4 speed automatic option The 92 Tempo was offered with annoying automatic seat belts that would constantly get jammed Off the line acceleration came smooth and relatively quick even with the clunky 3 speed automatic transmission a 5 speed manual is standard The interior of the 1992 Ford Tempo was anything but fancy Basic is the best word to describe the cabin of this car In the 1 year and 40 000 miles that I owned my 1992 Ford Tempo 110 000 total miles it was plagued with problems No ABS option Ford obviously did not not_have not_fuel not_economy not_nor not_handling not_in not_mind not_when not_they not_built not_the not_Tempo not_GLS not_i not_Interior not_accommodation not_Design i The 135 horsepower matched with a sufficient amount of torque reached at a relatively low RPM made it easy getting up to speed The Ford Tempo was available in 3 trim lines 2 different engines and 2 body styles the GL GLS and LX all available in either a 2 door sedan or 4 door sedan On a positive note the 1992 Tempo was quite roomy front and rear leg room were better than many cars and the trunk offered loads of room for a small car Reliability issues The steering was heavy and the car felt deprived of any sort of excitement whatsoever Cruising was also not not_the not_1992 not_Ford not_Tempo not_GLSs not_strong not_points not_the not_car not_was not_jolting not_on not_bumps not_and not_punishing not_at not_high not_freeway not_speeds not_due not_to not_wind not_road not_and not_engine not_noise The dash even in 1991 seemed very dated and the instrument cluster was also something you d expect to find in a much older vehicle Amenities were adequate for me Ac an AM FM cassette player power windows and door locks cruise control and tilt steering were about as much as you d find in the creature comfort category I ntroduced in 1983 as an 84 model the Tempo was a sales success for many of its 11 years in production and in its day was quite the proverbial eye candy Today most of us frown upon Ford Tempos The Ford Tempo has set a negative example for many once upon a time American car consumers that now look for cars made overseas For 1992 While this engine also came standard in the sluggish 1992 Ford Taurus the 3 0 in the Tempo allowed for significant improvement in acceleration thanks to the Tempos much lighter curb weight Handling in the Tempo was not not_much not_of not_a not_joy not_While not_the not_GLS not_sported not_a not_relatively not_sporty not_suspension not_the not_car not_would not_take not_to not_the not_turns not_just not_like not_the not_base not_models not_which not_was not_to not_say not_the not_very not_most not_languid not_and not_boring The other models came standard with a 96 horsepower 2 3 liter engine while my GLS came standard with a OHV 3 0 Vulcan V6 that pumped out 135 horsepower at 5 500 RPM and 150 lb ft of torque at 3 250 RPM hardly anything to write home about but compared to the standard engine with the other trim lines the 3 0 powered Tempo was a real road rocket i Driving Impressions i Here is a list of problems I can think of Boots replaced fuel injectors replaced constant wheel allignments power steering pump went out transmission developed shifting problems paint problems clogged catalytic converters automatic seat belts would jam up constantly and the dash board began to crack i Price i New the Tempo GLS ran for around 13 000 today thanks to poor resale value a GLS can be had for around 3 000 or even less I have seen them in the paper for as low as 1 200 with the claim that it runs great Other 1992 Cars To Consider In Random Order i 1 Ford Escort 2 Mazda Protege 3 Honda Civic 4 Honda Accord 5 Chevy Cavalier 6 VW Golf 7 Vw Jetta 8 Toyota Camry 9 Mazda 626 10 Toyota Corolla Happy car shopping The 3 speed automatic shifted fine but at high speeds above 55 MPH the transmission was not not_geared not_high not_enough not_to not_give not_a not_smooth not_ride not_Hills not_were not_taken well rarely did the car have any troubles tackling hills but again only 3 speeds of gears really hurt this cars cruising capabilities Braking was only adequate the brakes never gave me a complete feeling of security while coming to a stop the front disc rear drum set up left much to be desired in this department Fuel Economy was also not not_the not_Ford not_Tempos not_forte despite only having a 3 0 V6 the 3 speed automatic mated with this engine gave V8 Fuel economy I received around 18 MPG in the City and and around 22 MPG on the freeway Performance Gripes
Neg,The windshield wipers stick It leaks oil It dies constantly The brakes are mushy The odometer doesnt work It leaks transmission fluid It makes funny noises The gas mileage is frighteningly low The power locks have never worked The power steering has gone out twice The power windows only work on rare occaision The electrical system has had to be rewired You want more reasons to avoid this car The jack that comes with it is useless I have a 1992 Ford Tempo and I wish I didnt The turn signals have a habit of sticking and not not_deactivating not_after not_you not_complete not_the not_turn The service engine light went on the second week I had it and no matter what I have repaired it never goes off Is there anything good about this car I like the color Its a nice bright red In conclusion I hate this car The Ford Tempo should be avoided at all cost This car is the definition of the word lemon Everything that can go wrong with a car has gone wrong with this one I have replaced two starters the alternator and all of the hoses
Neg,For the record we replaced the alternator three times and eventually just gave up on the car and bought something else The basic scheme of the Ford Tempo in my mind was to build a cheap car that resembled something sporty To begin with there was no tape player while this was only a small problem the fact that the speakers were rather cheap and would blow if I attempted to play a song at a loud decibel I remember the day my parents came driving into the drive way with this piece of work Granted I didnt not_own not_a not_car not_at not_this not_point but something told me the Tempo was a bad buy My friend bought a 1988 Escort about a year ago and the transmission and seat belt motors went and presently my friend Josh has a 1995 Escort that makes strange noises that are suspicious Perhaps its time for Ford to stop trying to bring out new models like the Focus and work on the lesser ones like the Tempo Id give Ford a or A for the Mustang Thunderbird and Probe but a C overall because of the Tempo However along the way they seemed to forget that people have a way of remembering if a car breaks a lot To begin with the electronics that kept track of the fuel shorted out after about two months when my parents went to return the car so it could be fixed they were told it would cost in excess of 500 I had heard from a friend of mine that the car was pretty much just a piece of trash that breaks every 15 seconds but I could not not_believe not_this not_How not_could not_the not_makers not_of not_the not_Mustang not_and not_Thunderbird not_possibly not_make not_a not_lemon not_I not_had not_decided not_that not_the not_gas not_gauge not_was not_merely not_bad not_luck not_and not_one not_of not_those not_unexplainable not_things not_but not_a not_short not_while not_later not_when not_the not_alternator not_went not_I not_began not_thinking not_differently
Neg,My dad warned me though The power locks never work and the car makes a lot of noises when idle Two out of the four windows dont not_work not_AT not_ALL not_they not_neither not_go not_up not_or not_down The ride is pretty rough and loud I am currently looking for a new car hopefully a 1994 Honda Accord All tie rods battery muffler and a bunch of other little things that all add up not not_to not_mention not_a not_transmission not_leak not_thats not_been not_leaking not_for not_years not_OH not_and not_for not_the not_interior not_problems It tells you something when a car like the tempo is recommended 25 of the time with 2 out of 5 stars and the Accord is recommended 95 of the time with 5 stars Its a cheap car good for a first car but then again maybe not not_I not_bought not_the not_car not_from not_my not_sister not_for not_1 not_000 not_it not_is not_a not_1992 not_Ford not_Tempo not_GL not_I not_probably not_put not_about not_a not_1 not_000 not_into not_it not_already You get what you pay for you are going to have to put money in that car since it is so cheap Well I sure did I had it less then a year and Its been in the shop probably 7 times New Brakes Starter
Neg,And they burn They catch fire At least the brakes worked The automatic seat belts froze in place permanently Things went wrong with the car almost immediately The air conditioner broke on at least three occasions The paint came off of the roof in large patches It was like trying to drive a clown car It was a hand me down from my father thanks The transmission linkage and suspension on a Tempo are pure garbage Cheaply made and shoddily assembled The power locks failed so many times that my Dad just tore in and made them manual locks saving ninety dollars every three months for new solanoids He unloaded it on some chump for five hundred bucks I still think Dad won on the deal and I havent seen it since It was a lesson that could have killed me I saw that most other guys in the high school parking lot had nicer cars than mine Not because they had jobs but because their fathers werent TIGHTWADS I felt jealous and underprivileged im not not_much for wrap ups where grades arent concerned so THE END PS You should be grateful for this car because you didnt not_have not_to not_work not_a not_day not_of not_your not_life not_to not_get not_it not_In not_my not_day not_blah not_blah not_blah not_Yeah not_Dad not_WHATEVER The drivers side power window also quit working Of course this made going through the drive through at restaurants or just rolling it down for some fresh air quite difficult He could have afforded to get me a new Toyota or Honda but instead insisted on giving me this PIECE OF SH to I suppose Teach me the value of a dollar or whatever If they hadnt I might have been killed ten times over by now I am over six feet tall and this car was so cramped I could barely squeeze into it My head touched the ceiling The transmission bled out leaving a trail of fluid

not_new not_Regal The guy who fixed it on the second time pulled off the button panel to find that the plastic on the other side was melted and that I was lucky the car had not not_caught not_fire not_Tempos not_do that you know There was just the question of what to do with the Tempo I wanted to push it into the Ohio River or maybe take it to a gun range and shoot at it but my dad decided to have it towed away and repaired The only reason it was still POSSIBLE is that Dad glued a metal handle to the top of the window allowing me a very low tech way to raise and lower it The car lurched lunged and shook while I drove it It made grinding noises and occasionally made a sound as if a massive sledgehammer was hitting the hood So ends the saga of my first and last Ford car I am man enough to admit that on occasion this car terrified me I feared for my life when driving this car I did not not_take not_it not_on not_freeways not_for not_fear not_that not_it not_would not_malfunction

first car Ask yourself if its better to teach your kid the value of a buck while putting his her life in danger or to get the kid a Honda Civic so he she can LEARN TO DRIVE A DAM CAR WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT HAVING TO FIX IT EVERY THREE WEEKS SEE WHAT YOU COME UP WITH Okay im finally done This is the first Epinions review I have done for a car I usually stick to PC games and the like and it might seem silly to review such an outdated car anyway But im sitting here with nothing better to do and some things to get off my chest about this HEAP that I drove for five years and where better to do it than Epinions I got my blue 92 Tempo Sedan when I was 17 Dad thats the best hand me down you gave me since I genetically inherited your asthma and was already a few years old Oh and let me say this

Neg,It was used but it seemed like a good deal And he was right the wheels never failed to unalign themselves quickly This was my first car I got it the day I got my drivers license And not not_to not_say not_anything not_too not_bad not_about not_it not_this not_car not_served not_its not_purpose not_and not_got not_me not_around not_safely not_throughout not_high not_school not_and not_my not_first not_year not_at not_college However it is really not not_that not_terrific not_of not_a not_vehicle and it has some problems along with its good points First of all the alignment is off completely Lastly the speakers were pretty bad one of them buzzed continuously whenever any base was turned on I did have a great time in this car My old one now sits in a car graveyard after busting a rod through the engine Check out my review of the Mitsubishi Mirage to see how much happier I am now This caused the tires to wear unevenly and it was annoying having to pull the steering wheel 20 degrees to the right to get the car to go straight It was a fun and great to drive around my small town but it is not not_a not_powerful not_vehicle and it does not not_handle not_very not_well not_I not_would not_not not_reccomend not_buying not_one not_of not_these not_used not_vehicles Once when I got the tires rotated the servicer told me that there was no use in balancing them they would just be unaligned the second i drove over a bump Also the paint job on this car was pretty awful Every time I would dry the car after washing it my towels would be completely red Also the black paint around the windows on my car chipped off and every other tempo I have seen has this same problem
Neg,We bought a used 1995 Ford Aerostar in 1998 The simplists tasks become major chores in this van But im not not_willing not_to not_take not_that not_chance What was a problem was lousy gas mileage Another problem was the frequent problems with the front end alignment Also the manuverability for changing lanes pulling into parking spaces or any of the other simplist driving tasks is terrible While this may seem a good idea for some it was a source of constant annoyance for us We had the big bench in front at some points at other points it was the small bench in front Our initial reason for buying the van was that we have 4 children 2 of which are still in car seats It seemed to never stayed aligned regardless of how excellent a condition the roads were in Also the van drives very heavily The children loved to play with the buttons and were constantly changing the radio station I can give this van one more bit of praise And during road trips our boys could get comfortable lay their head on a pillow positioned over the arm rest and go to sleep while still buckled securely into their seats For those of you out there that have a large family and are frequently taking road trips the bench seats in the van can be taken out easily and rearranged And the fact that it squeeks and rattles and makes a lot of noise doesnt make matters any better Also I have to admit that I did not not_like not_the not_air not_conditioning not_vents not_for not_the not_back They did not not_cool not_or not_heat not_the not_back not_area not_of not_the not_van not_very not_well not_Even not_the not_children not_in not_the not_bench not_seat not_closest not_to not_the not_front not_of not_the not_van not_were not_often not_either not_not not_warm not_enough not_or not_not not_cool not_enough not_Also not_on not_the not_drivers not_side not_in not_the not_passenger not_area not_there are some controls for the stereo And finally one last warning During the 1 1 2 yrs we had this van we constantly had mechanical problems with it Also since the front end alignment was frequently off the tires wore down unevenly very quickly and had to be replaced more quickly then they would have been otherwise But the arrangement that we used the most often and was what the children seemed to enjoy the most was when we had the front bench face backwards so that on road trips the children could be buckled in securely and yet still interact with each other and share toys back and forth What I mean by this is that when going around curves or making a turn it leans on its side and makes you feel like you are going to tip over True this vehicle is built like a tank and if it did tip over we d probably be safe With a family that size our options were very limited Initially we were pleased because with the 2 bench seats as well as the 2 front seats it is a 7 passenger vehicle which made it roomy enough for our crowd Even with the 2 car seats there was still plenty of room for the other 2 older boys to sit comfortably without being squished Also since we had the extended cargo area van there was plenty of room for hauling whether it was the futon bed we bought for our toddler when it came time for him to move from the crib or the computer desk or all our luggage when driving from California to D C Roominess was never a problem with this van
Neg,That is my opinion on the Ford Econoline van The van rides well but it only has a 302 V8 and does not not_any not_power not_whatsoever My father owns a 1991 Ford Econoline van and it the biggest piece of junk he has ever owend This is not not_a not_good not_vehicle not_to not_buy not_in not_general not_I not_cannot not_recommend not_this not_van not_to not_anyone not_it not_is not_nothing not_but not_a not_7000 not_lb not_gas not_hog It has a spacious interior and alot of room but that is the only good thing I can say about it The van averages only 13 mpg you cannot not_see not_out not_of not_the not_rearview not_mirror and it has no acceleration and you cannot not_keep not_the not_front not_end not_aligned
Neg,The interior was impressive all kinds of little gadgets rear air etc etc This machine will NOT do well off road in really nasty conditions Its obviously not not_intended not_to not_Raise not_the not_hood and you see a backyard mechanics nightmare It did NOT feel like a truck at all and of course thats Fords intent The seats were comfy the driving position good For forty grand or so it should be fancy Thats OK for the average owner who has gotten one because he or she needs a big tall station wagon with 4 wheel drive But if like me you want something you can fix in a pinch and take anywhere then this aint the rig for you When you look at the front suspension you know immediately why it rides as it does struts CV joints torsion bars its a car suspension not not_really for trucks I finally took a close look at a Ford Expedition ive been a 4x4 owner since the sixties everything from CJ5 Jeeps to Ramchargers to Broncos I had the feeling from afar that this new Ford rig was not not_like not_anything not_I not_was not_used not_to not_I not_was not_right If you like to work on your own machine say to change the plugs once in a while do oil changes and the like you will not not_enjoy not_this not_machine not_Half not_the not_engine not_is not_up not_under not_the not_firewall not_cowl not_Change not_the not_plugs not_Not not_from not_the not_top not_you not_wont It drives like a big heavy station wagon with a slightly stiffer suspension than would have been found in the big wagons of the 60s and 70s Handling was fair but the old Bronco has it beat in terms of predictability on bumpy turns Loaded heavily the Expedition has a tendency to develop rear end sway and instability at highway speeds But if you can afford one of these you can afford to have it worked on and cost of doing a job under the hood will be high lots of stuff in the way and lousy access means longer times for various maintenance tasks I dont not_like not_the not_Expedition not_at not_all Looks great drives OK nice interior appointments fine for anyone who is not not_a not_4x4 not_purist
Neg,This was no laughing manner Then I heard laughter Things have simply gone too far Why we just filled up thirty miles ago Then the Expedition drove up and inside sat one solitary little person My wife and I rented an SUV for our honeymoon A Rodeo When shopping for an SUV please do not not_consider not_size The sudden quake of the soil beneath me meant only one thing How much would it cost to fill up one of these Oh yeah we ll stop here I have to pee anyway Things have simply gone too far I have long supported the SUV craze If an individual so desires one of these lumbering Goliaths known as THE FORD EXPIDITION It has not not_been not_a not_decision not_of not_preference not_but not_rather not_one not_of not_economy My son just saw a midget driving an Expedition to another worker in his office When the Ford Expedition came out it was test marketed in the Dallas area No I do not not_desire not_one not_myself but I believe in life liberty and the pursuit of happiness My former boss owned a Suburban and he said it cost him fifty bucks to fill up his tank Then in understanding she would pause a moment look down at the dash realizing the monstrosity of the vehicle encasing her and say The not not_so not_proud owner of a Jeep SUV and informed him of the horror I witnessed this morning I heard him say Hey Cathy You see I have no children I do not not_coach not_a not_soccer not_team and my bikes can easily be hung on a trunk mount for my one weekend warrior exercise I called my Dad They are unsafe scary to little cars and impractical Buy a semi instead im at least used to those I do not not_think not_a not_midget not_wearing not_a not_suit not_and not_driving not_an not_eighteen not_wheeler not_would not_cause not_me not_such not_mental not_distress It was a small SUV As we drove across Death Valley I would say to my wife Heres a gas station we d better fill up She would look at me in confusion and say Not to argue semantics but I have always heard people with the unfortunate condition called midgets so im sorry if I offend anyone out there I was more disturbed by the sheer ludicraceness of the whole event Do not not_read not_me not_wrong not_I not_have

Expedition This Fellini esque circumstance freaked my world if you know what im saying I am six four Tall by some standards average size by these bean stalk kids I see sacking my groceries in the stores Despite my lanky stature I have always driven small compact decent minded cars The news crews were interviewing people about it I remember clearly one lone man stating when asked if he would buy the boat Yes I like it Its big For those of you who feel the need to drive around in a monster raise the wheels on your truck take the muffler out of your Pinto so that at least it sound big Please do not not_purchase not_a not_Ford not_Expedition Why would I want a monster to guzzle up all my hard earned dollars on gas when I can blow them on beer video games and CDs I have long been content to tour around town in a minuscule ill endowed boy vehicle I have justified the Suburbans lumbering along beside my trusty old Civic with its dead head sticker happily advertising my social demeanor from the rear window as cars of practicality for some There was an SUV approaching I looked up to see the driver of the vehicle I love kids so I was expecting to see a weary mother driving her three kids to day care Its always a pleasure to see a group of rambunctious kids horse playing in the back of an SUV or mini van With a smile upon my face I girded my expectations for such a sight Who am I to question their decision I am but a humble boy who drives a fuel efficient Civic I must now take a stand I must now declare that I was wrong in my support for I have only egged on the boggling dimensions of the SUV engineering philosophy I must now rise up and denounce all the soccer moms and all the weekend warriors I must rip apart my misguided goodwill and throw it to the side Here was a person that needed a fourth of the amount of room as myself driving a car that was four times as big as my own Did they have children did they coach soccer or baseball why did they buy this mistake of a vehicle I was boggled beyond simple mundane ordinary confusion I felt the juice I had ingested earlier that morning swelling up in my stomach and my ulcer began to throb The Ford Expedition gets twelve count em twelve miles to the gallon
Neg,That will cut your gas bills two fold There is absolutely no need for such large vehicles they only spell trouble Do you need a lot of room in your car Try a mini van Having trouble handling in rugged terrain What is white not not_black not_and not_red all over ME After being struck head on in a collision while driving at least 35 mph I Klaxonman a Caucasian male became red all over Red from blood While the driver of these cars may be safe are the people driving the sedans No Not at all I suffered at least three broken bones in my rib cage and I lost quite a bit of blood from cuts due to shattered glass Had a smaller vehicle hit me head on the result may have been a bit different Another poor aspect of such large SUVs is the fact that they are gas guzzlers Virtually any sedan will get mileage that is twice as efficient as the Expedition You will be saving a lot of money in purchasing a smaller vehicle With that said what advantages that the Expedition may have can outweigh the disadvantages of purchasing of such a large car I think the choice is easy There are plenty of 4 wheel drive vehicles which come at a much lower price and a much smaller size Before you decide to purchase the expedition just think of these two points 1 Large SUVs are much more dangerous to other drivers than sedans 2 What I am trying to say is dont not_just not_think not_about not_yourself not_when not_purchasing not_such not_a not_large not_vehicle not_think not_of not_the not_other not_drivers not_on not_the not_road not_While not_this not_review not_may not_not not_relate not_to not_the not_specific not_car not_I not_hope not_this not_may not_sway not_your not_decision not_of not_purchasing not_a not_tank not_of not_a not_car
Neg,But as much as I mull it over even if I had the money for it an SUV just seems a bit wrong We love dogs dogs love trucks we love trucks I understand that for many many people an SUV is a sensible purchase These days in America capitalism and consumerism are the twin gods that no one dares blaspheme and the auto market is perhaps the arena where these gods exert the most influence However going off road is becoming more and more rare as there becomes more and more road and therefore less and less off road From what I have seen the bumpiest road that a majority of SUVs see is a gravel driveway Expedition into vanity selfishness and irresponsibility I realize that this may not not_be not_the not_forum not_for not_such not_a not_discussion but I know some people about to buy an SUV will read this and I am curious about what they think Are SUVs a guilty pleasure or a bit irresponsible But why do I care live and let live right Not really First of all because SUVs are bigger and bigger it becomes less and less safe to own a small car I mean a Ford Expedition could run over one of those Ford Festivas and not not_even know it This is an alarming trend The first Jeeps managed to be hardy without being Hummers but others dont not_seem not_to not_think not_this not_is not_possible not_Secondly and I am no eco terrorist here but the gas mileage thing does seem a bit short sighted Thirdly the sheer tonage of an Expedition does a lot more damage to city and suburban roads than a smaller car would In conclusion it seems to me that a lot of the reason many people buy SUVs is simply vanity Cars once had vanity plates and now are becoming big packages of vanity themselves I realize that often the American dream is measured in terms of how many cars fit in your garage Living in a city and near decent public transportation I have managed to live without a car for my whole life However I cant not_help not_it not_I not_lust not_after not_them not_daily And yet now everyone makes an SUV because the market for them is just that big Isnt it great that we have all this money Isnt it lovely that our country is at peace and has been for years Isnt it fantastic that we can write talk and exchange opinions with people all over the globe Isnt it about time we started caring for someone besides ourselves Please feel free to correct me but it seems that SUVs are a symptom of a larger problem I dont not_mean not_to not_condemn not_anyone not_I not_am not_just not_curious not_about not_the not_real not_causes not_behind not_this not_disturbing not_trend
Neg,This vehicle is definitely a REAL GAS GUZZLER It also feels great to drive up high Be ready to spend lots of with Todays Gas Prices It definitely offers spacious comfort this is definitely a plus The one thing we really did not not_prepare not_for was the lack of luggage space The 3rd seat is O K for now with kids that is However third seat definitely not not_for not_adults Just dont not_know not_how not_long not_I not_can not_afford not_to not_keep not_it not_Several not_things not_drove not_me not_to not_purchase not_my not_2000 not_Eddie not_Bauer not_Ford not_Expedition At first I really had a concern as to whether I a 4 11 woman could really handle driving a vehicle this size We took our first out of town trip in it last month I have only had it 60 days at that time I must say its definitely much better mileage on long distance travel With two different drivers in my household for this same vehicle I have really enjoyed the feature that allows you to pre set the adjustments of the seats mirrors gas amp brake pedals using the key remote this I REALLY like My kids have really enjoyed the ability of having rear CONTROL of the MUSIC and the A C Personally I like the built in earphone jacks that the rear offers and they do use them Only kids with their short legs can really enjoy the 3rd seat With the handy step up boards and hand grips getting on or off is not not_a not_problem not_at not_all not_I not_was not_also not_concerned not_about not_turns not_and not_parking not_again not_not not_a not_problem not_at not_all not_OVER not_ALL not_it not_is not_really not_pretty not_smooth not_to not_drive not_and not_handles not_well not_With not_its not_size not_I not_feel not_a not_great not_sense not_of not_safety not_although not_an not_impact not_is not_an not_impact not_I not_just not_feel not_it not_would not_be not_a not_bit not_different not_in not_comparison not_to not_the not_size not_vehicle not_I not_previously not_drove Yes it does have an above exterior luggage rack however we found out at the stops along the way we had to try to park where our vehicle would be within view because of our luggage even though it was tied down and pretty secured we still felt unsure of leaving it out of sight AGAIN THIS VEHICLE IS JUST SUCH A GAS GUZZLER I JUST DOnt KNOW HOW LONG I CAN AFFORD TO KEEP IT
Neg,I recently rented a 2000 Ford Expedition for a weekend outing and to road test the vehicle The Tahoe on the otherhand handles very well for a SUV will literally smoke the tires on dry pavement and gets anywhere from 15 mpg to 22 mpg This vehicle is not not_made not_for not_the not_serious not_4x4 not_nuts not_at not_all not_its not_simply not_not not_designed not_to not_go not_off not_road not_too not_far and if you do you d better have someone following you with a long tow rope The Expedition got an average of 11 miles per gallon throughout the whole trip which was 3 consecutive days I got it stuck in the mud 4 different times which required a tow out of the mud each time it handles terribly on and off road and seems to me that it is underpowered for its size There are alot of pros and cons with this SUV I currently own a 1999 Chevrolet Tahoe and have not not_one not_complaint not_regarding not_the not_vehicle not_so not_far not_it not_has not_went not_everywhere not_that not_ive not_decided not_to not_take not_it not_and not_not not_once not_has not_it not_skipped not_a not_beat not_in not_doing not_so not_I not_rented not_this not_Expedition not_to not_compare not_it not_to not_the not_Tahoe not_Well not_there is no comparison the Tahoe wins hands down for certain Do not not_get not_me not_wrong not_the not_Expedition not_is not_a not_very not_comfortable not_nice not_riding not_luxurious not_SUV and does have an abundance of qualities that alot of other automakers simply do not not_think not_of not_when not_manfacturing not_thier not_SUVs not_I not_feel not_that not_the not_Expedition not_is not_suitable not_for not_the not_buisness not_executive not_type not_of not_consumer not_that not_needs not_the not_four not_wheel not_drive not_occasionally not_maybe not_to not_get not_to not_his not_her not_office not_in not_the not_snow not_safely not_and not_get not_there not_in not_ultimate not_comfort
Neg,And the dealership said Sorry No Can DO And also they should consider redesigning the front passenger seats its way too uncomfortable We thought it was the air conditioning so we turned that off At that point we called the dealership and told them that we no longer wanted the TRUCK We got the Red Carpet Lease whatever the heck that means for 2 years and 15 K Miles per year We got the vehicle September 14th and we were so excited since its been a while since we got a new vehicle much less an SUV That whole incident freaked me out to say the least After only one day of having the truck the next day its back in the shop The next day me and my family when to church and was on our way home and all of a sudden the truck made this weird sound 1997 was the year that we leased the Expedition from Kearny Mesa Ford and to say the least that was the beginning of our NIGHTMARE To make the long story short we got stuck with that 598 00 per month lease but we are done with it and do you think I will recommend their dealership to anyone after they screwed us BIG TIME NO WAY It continued to make that irritating noise so my husband decided to pull over to the side of the freeway Thats it The whole truck died on us so we had to call a towing service and had it returned to the dealership
Neg,That thing is a gas guzzler The gas mileage isnt not_that not_great not_either You cant not_park not_in not_tight not_parking not_spots not_for not_the not_same not_reason In my opinion you would be better off avoiding it The Expedition seems like a ploy to sell vehicles by riding the SUV craze It isnt not_good not_for not_hauling not_things not_when not_it not_is not_full not_because not_there not_isnt not_enough not_trunk not_space not_the not_seats not_are not_uncomfortable not_and not_cramped not_and not_it not_is not_built not_poorly not_I not_had not_neighbors not_who not_owned not_the not_Expedition not_and not_they not_had not_to not_take not_it not_to not_the not_shop not_quite not_frequently not_because not_of not_one not_problem not_or not_another The Expedition is seen as Fords response to the GMC Suburban I must say that I prefer the Suburban to the Expedition which merely seems to be a larger version of the Explorer The Suburban was the original oversized SUV and Ford tried to imitate it I think that the Expedition is too big Bigger isnt not_always not_better not_For not_one not_thing not_it not_is not_hard not_to not_drive not_the not_Expedition not_on not_narrow not_roads not_because not_it not_is not_so not_wide
Neg,There are good things to the car though It has a lot of room for the children and yourself Another thing is that its a high up car if u like to be high up Also the gas bill is very high because it has a really big tank to fill the gass Is that a truck or a tank Its an ok car for a big family but has no room in the trunk for anything Its a very tiny space The bad thing is though that it is a very big car and can put smaller cars in danger if the get in an accident Make sure you make a really good decision before you buy the car
Neg,This vehicle had nothing but flaws and defects What a terrible vehicle for such a price The tranny became noisy at 10 K miles The 4 6L motor is truly an embarassment significantly underpowered This vehicle couldnt even climb some highway inclines without downshifting and significantly winding out the engine It was in the shop more times than not not_and not_the not_service not_department not_could not_never not_fix not_it not_right It came delivered with dry ball joints a twisted brake line defective door gaskets a bad door latch rattles in the dashboard Who would ever have thought that someday one would have to pay 30 K or more for a Ford They were only good at making excuses for it Then of course the truck gained a terrible vibration at 46 K miles that couldnt be resolved either
Neg,The color scheme is pretty boring Gray on gray This car does not not_burn not_oil not_even not_now not_economically not_a not_plus So I spent the rest of the day chugging through This model was designed and produced before the acquisition of Mazda by Ford No extra or flashy details except the idiot light suggesting when to shift So now I will tell you about the crawl space disguised as the interior This can be very annoying My solution is to turn up the music The back support is good and I rarely have a back ache even after long drives The van is for family accommodations and the trucks are because apparently real men drive trucks It is lessened by a fuller tank giving less space for the echo effect of the closed tank The Sierra has a lift kit on it I get in it with a rope ladder Thank you for reading this post it is my first participation in a write off It is just safer to get out of their way and look sheepish as they pass Let me tell you what I do know about the internal workings of my beasty sports car I have to begin with a disclaimer there is no listing for the Ford Escort prior to 1992 It is the last year that the Escort was still fairly boxy in body style and attempted to be a sports car The choke is electric and apparently suffers brain freeze if exposed to lower than freezing temperatures longer than 49 seconds What the point is I dont not_know not_I not_just not_make not_it not_a not_point not_to not_monitor not_my not_oil not_level The dash panel is easily accessible mostly because you are sitting on it Standard Ford issue with A C included in the GT package The person that I posed this question to was roadiem and his response was prompt and encouraging to join in on one The back seats are actually roomier than the front ones if you dont not_count not_leg not_room and the two seats will collapse forward to make a larger trunk The opposing weather condition of prolonged extreme heat can result in vapor lock which also temporarily disables all engine functions so long travels are only smooth in moderate temperatures The irony in this is that when I first started writing at epinions I was curious about what these write offs were If you are in the drivers seat it does feel like the steering wheel is attempting to rest on your chest and your wearing a waist down body cast This car is not not_for not_the not_vain or the self conscious sort I am old enough not to care and I have more money for other things in the long run And the low profile tires are far more expensive than standard tires Every time I look at it I have to fight the urge to peel the pin striping off If you dont not_begin not_your not_journey not_with not_an not_intimate not_friend not_you not_may not_be not_that not_way not_at not_the not_end not_of not_the not_trip not_as not_there not_is not_maybe not_4 not_inches not_between not_the not_driver not_and not_passenger not_seats not_in not_the not_front This ugly little car is eleven years old with 112 00 miles on it I find the convenience to be traveling about four hundred miles on about 15 00 more important than how I look The engine does stall but once it has started stalling you can get another 50 miles or so before it refuses to run altogether I do not not_travel not_long not_distance not_in not_this not_vehicle not_during not_the not_winter not_months If there has not not_been not_a not_passing not_lane not_for not_several not_miles and the grade has been somewhat inclined you should be able to easily spot a three mile chain of ticked off fellow motorists driving on your back bumper They also collapse independently if you only want half of the trunk larger Seat belts are in abundance with shoulder harness provided in the back seats and the annoying automatic shoulder harness in the front seats which generally scare your passenger if they are not not_used not_to not_them While on the subject of fuel one should know that the fuel pump here is a self propelling unit actually in the gas tank and within a year of owning the car I could hear it and I am certain anyone within twenty feet can hear it as well These are very noisy and no amount of WD 40 decreases this The driver harness jammed in the closed position a long time ago so I do not not_have not_to not_contend not_with not_it not_The not_other not_problem not_with not_automatic not_shoulder not_belts is that it makes it hard to remember your lap belt which is not not_automatic There was a Mazda Ford integration in 1991 and all models beyond this date had significant changes in body style as well as engine specifications so some of the claims I make on this vehicle may not not_be not_valid not_on not_current not_models not_Please not_do not_not not_rate not_me not_down not_for not_off not_topic not_I not_am not_not not_very not_auto not_literate It is in fact rated a sports car for insurance purposes primarily I was told because it is a three door or hatchback model Ford also attempted to give it a sporty look by adding a pinstripe decal tail scoop and low profile tires but I see no justification in labeling any car with a 4 cylinder engine as a sports car He also had comforting and supportive comments to my postings about my struggles with my eldest daughter in the past I did not not_know not_roadiem but it was easy enough to ascertain that he was extremely devoted to his family friends and mankind and womankind in general I am saddened to hear of his passing and offer prayer for the family The engine is a 1 9 litre with fuel injected cams I have no idea what the 1 9 litre spec is saying other than engine size but I understand the fuel injected part versus carburetor function so I can say something about that I have never had to have the injectors serviced but I do add cleaners to my gas tank every three or four months In closing I would like to say if you are looking for a dependable commuting vehicle with good gas mileage and fair to average comfort with below average repairs and low maintenance you may want to consider an Escort Remember this is an epinion on a pre 1991 model after that everything changed and I know nothing about that except I think the newer model Escorts resemble the Mazda 626 My best explanation is I had to begin my ascent at 120 mph just to reach the top on the same day and I was just beginning to slow down Mr Officer was not not_amused but did warn me that there were patrol cars hidden about every two miles for the rest of the mountains about 30 miles and at those speeds I could easily have to file bankruptcy by the time I reached the end of the mountain pass You will be disadvantaged in an Escort if you have a need for speed Declines are a different story and if you are like me by the time you have entered a declined grade you will be ready for a speed increase Control this urge within reason or you may have to explain to an officer as I did the reason you are doing 87 mph in a 65 mph zone after completing an easterly ascent into the Blue Mountains which is about a 6 mile 6 grade incline It is my opinion that if one cannot not_shift not_by not_engine not_sound not_or not_read not_the not_magical not_tachometer then one should probably aspire to an automatic vehicle I tilt the steering wheel at an angle that blocks this light from my view because I find it annoying I also wish the engine warning display included an oil pressure display I asked a Ford mechanic about this once and was told that if the oil can with a slashed circle illuminates on my dashboard then it is probable the block is already cracked And I dont not_allow not_the not_gas not_tank not_to not_empty not_farther not_than not_1 not_4 not_tank not_to not_avoid not_pulling not_stuff not_off not_the not_bottom

have had no other troubles with this vehicle engine wise except I had to replace the water pump twice so far and the alternator once I do think that is pretty minimal for a car of eleven years I do wonder why the clutch has held up through all these miles because this is a common source of problems with most Ford compact cars Here is my one and only epinion on an auto I chose to write about this auto because it is the one I know the best We also have a full size GMC Sierra a Chevrolets 10 king cab and a Mercury Villager mini van Obviously there is a clash of opinion for vehicle manufacturer choice I have pretty much stayed true to Ford for most of my life I suspect this is a subliminal choice as my high school boyfriend had a cherry 65 mustang and it was the envy of the school I have

Neg,That means roll up window manual door locks and levers and knobs to adjust the seats no electrical assistance The gas mileage of the Escort was actually very good at about 36 mpg 9 4 gallons per 340 miles The engine noise however was somewhat annoying sort of a choked buzzing noise that is common with both GM amp Fords 4 cylinder cars There was no remote adjust on either outside mirrors which was just a minor inconvenience since I only had to adjust them once The gauges on the car were very Spartan with 120 mph speedometer odometer fuel gauge temperature gauge and warning lights but no tachometer or oil pressure gauge It took a while to get used to the seats as I had to make several adjustments to make myself somewhat comfortable In a way I was happy with this quasi sportiness as I always knew which gear the car was in just by listening to the engine and keeping track of the distinct shifts Driving This included a little stop amp go driving to fight traffic around Indianapolis Speedway Overall Impression The Ford Escort seems like a pretty good value for the money with usable horsepower solid handling and great gas mileage However time will tell if the Escort will become a reliable used car in which case I would highly recommended it for use as an inexpensive commute car like the Chevrolet Sprint I drive The 4 speed automatic transmission with OverDrive was actually pretty good with solid shifting and timely downshifting when I passed other cars A Toyota smooth transmission would not not_fit not_well not_with not_this not_car not_as not_it not_would not_contrast not_too not_much not_with not_the not_buzzy not_engine If I wanted this much noise then Id want the engine to sound throaty not not_choked not_Most not_4 not_cylinder not_engines not_in not_Japanese not_or not_European not_cars not_feel not_smoother not_and not_quieter not_than not_the not_Escort not_Furthermore not_my not_3 not_cylinder not_1985 not_Chevy not_Sprint not_with not_110 not_000 not_miles not_seems not_smoother not_and not_quieter The car came with an AM FM radio with cassette which helped during my daily 3 4 hours drive from Monticello to Indianapolis and back I had to pull the antenna out manually keeping with the barebones spirit of the car Interior One nice feature was remote trunk opener a yellow button underneath the steering wheel Engine Transmission The Escorts Overhead Cam OHC 2 0 liter engine had a lot of spunk as I was able to drive 70 85 mph without stressing the engine I didnt not_floor not_the not_accelerator not_much not_during not_the not_entire not_5 not_days The cars styling is somewhat generic and there are enough minor annoyances like difficult to adjust seats and engine noise to remind you that this is a starter car suited for students and budget buyers With the Ford Focus and Toyota Echo in the marketplace now it d be tough for me to recommend the Escort as a new car purchase The steering on the Escort was actually very good as it had good feedback and pointed the car where I steered even though its power steering it felt more to me like it was power assisted I was greeted with thunderstorms every morning but the Escort felt just as solid in the rain and I felt very comfortable driving it 65 70 mph I requested Budget Rent a Car for a Toyota Tercel during my 5 days in Illinois and Indiana recently but instead ended up with a green 2000 Ford Escort 4 door with 4000 miles on the odometer I was somewhat excited because this was like test driving a brand new car a feat I dont not_perform not_very not_often not_Furthermore not_the not_test not_drive not_was not_going not_to not_last not_the not_whole not_weekend not_Basic not_Features not_Except not_for not_the not_automatic not_transmission not_and not_air not_conditioning not_the not_Escort not_I not_drove not_was not_barebones The seats can move back amp forth by the lever under the front of it and the upper portion can tilt forward and back with a rotating knob on the left a standard way to adjust seats on most cars I felt that the seat bottom could have used more cushion as it is not not_tiltable and I didnt not_get not_enough not_support not_on not_my not_thighs not_leading not_my not_hips not_to not_hurt not_the not_first not_2 not_days not_of not_driving not_I not_cured not_this not_by not_taking not_my not_shoes not_off not_while not_driving not_which not_lowered not_my not_legs
Neg,In 1992 It was great on gas very economical and an okay first car It was a little rough around the edges it needed a new muffler and brakes but other than that it was fine If I had to get another older car I wouldnt not_get not_a not_car not_thats not_12 not_years not_old not_I not_would not_consider not_getting not_a not_5 not_or not_6 not_year not_old not_Escort All in all I didnt not_have not_too not_many not_problems not_with not_this not_car but it was 11 years old when I got it so it had been through its good times My husband had a car and my father needed a car so I gave him mine Sadly though the little Escort only lasted through one more cold Canadian winter before my father sold it for junk I bought my first car and it was a 1981 Ford Escort I just wanted a little car to drive around town get groceries take my son to the doctor etc without having to rely on public transportation It was a standard transmission and since I had never driven one before I had to teach myself how to drive it It wasnt not_that not_hard not_and not_soon not_I not_was not_driving not_it not_in not_my not_opinion not_like not_I not_had not_been not_driving not_a not_stick not_shift not_for not_years not_I not_only not_had not_it not_for not_a not_few not_months not_and not_then not_gave not_it not_to not_my not_father not_when not_I not_got not_married
Neg,The difference in power between these two engines is practically unnoticeable All in all a decent car just make sure you dont not_pay not_too not_much The repairs are extremely difficult for the home mechanic and extremely high in a shop Secondly I have found that the smaller 1 6 liter engine is far more fuel effecient and reliable than its 1 9 liter counterpart The problem was that the clutch disk wore out on it Being a front wheel drive vehicle the repairs cost over 600 on a 30 part Most people prefer not not_to not_drive not_a not_standard not_anyway not_so not_this not_wont not_matter not_to not_you not_My not_biggest not_piece not_of not_advice not_for not_this not_car not_is not_DOnt not_BUY not_A not_STANDARD I have owned to Ford Escorts in my life I bought these because they were older models and very cheap I soon found out why they were so cheap I used my first Escort an 85 model to commute over 60 miles to work I found it to be very easy to drive and extremely comfortable
Neg,Now my multi functional switch is broken It was is just a bare bones truck The total cost of the vehicle was around 18 000 This meant that it did not not_have not_CD not_auto not_locks not_auto not_windows not_etc It did however come with a free 24 hour roadside service package and a 1 000 rebate In January of 1999 I bought a brand new 1999 Ford Ranger Extended Cab with the Sport package My question was never answered Neither was a direct inquiry to Ford ever answered Thanks to the roadside service I was able to take the truck to the dealership When I inquired as to whether my NEW truck had come with used parts I was put aside And I was told that Ford no longer makes that electrical part so the only parts on the market are used They then admitted that there was a glitch and replaced the broken part with a used part remanufactured is the term they used When I complained about them replacing the part with a used one they stated that it was Ford policy to replace electrical parts with used ones The power system totally shut down while I was on a dangerous strip of highly trafficed road Barely able to coast off the road I was sure that we were going to die The first thing that I noticed about this vehicle is that it isnt not_designed not_for not_people not_of not_slightly not_above not_average not_height not_Being not_6 not_2 not_my not_field not_of not_view not_is not_very not_limited and the vehicle is sort of cramped But it was all that I could afford Almost immediately my truck began to malfunction I took it to a nearby dealer for an inspection Since I didnt not_buy not_the not_truck not_from not_their not_dealership not_they not_didnt not_act not_as not_if not_they not_cared not_to not_help not_me not_with not_my not_problem So every time that I try to make a turn my wipers come on But since it takes 45 minutes to 2 hours to even talk to a customer service rep from Ford I have yet to get it fixed Trust me my next truck WILL NOT be a Ford Ford Tough give me a break And when I finally did get them to look at it they said that nothing was wrong with it My main concern was power surges that caused my lights radio etc to go on and off in a sort of flicker fashion After 3 tries of trying to get is looked at I was told that nothing was wrong this coming from the Ford mechanics Shortly after that me and my father were almost killed due to their mis diagnosis
Neg,This arrangement creates another problem That is just the beginning of the problem The dashboard developed a persistent and very annoying creak Now I realize no car truck is perfect The interior light for ironically the lighting controls ceased functioning Unlike many other trucks the Ranger has almost no room underneath the seats The manual transmission is tight and the engine produces good pickup for a 4 cylinder The seat developed a slight tear And lastly the wheel alignment went astray to the right The suspension is a bit bumpy but thats to be expected from a truck The tires that come standard with the vehicle are terrible on anything but dry pavement What this means is that short of a minor miracle you cant not_place not_an not_external not_amplifier not_anywhere but behind the seats The power steering works great although on my particular vehicle the right tire rubs against the wheel well if the steering wheel is turned completely to the right The reason this is a problem is because aftermarket 5 x7 speakers can be hard to find Even harder to find are top quality speakers in this size arrangement The gas mileage has been right where the sticker said it should be I have not not_needed not_to not_have not_any not_routine not_parts not_such not_as not_headlights not_or not_turn not_signal not_bulbs not_replaced My final analysis of the Ford Ranger is that it is a servicable vehicle but nothing I could find myself recommending to a friend or waiting in anticipation to buy I bought the cheapest American made im a patriot so sue me truck I could find and it is a Ford Ranger with no options save the am fm stereo which I begrudgingly accepted However a new car should be relatively problem free for the first year in my opinion Inside of the first 6 months I experienced the following problems Straight from the dealer the plastic molding on the right front pillar wasnt not_installed not_properly The conclusion that I have to draw is that the Ranger is not not_the not_most not_rugged not_of not_vehicles not_which not_is not_a not_bit not_disappointing not_it not_being not_a not_truck and all Overall the vehicle has not not_been not_a not_vast not_disappointment This is where the underseat space comes into play because with many other light pickups an amp could be placed under either seat facilitating greater flexability in the setup behind the seat such as two subwoofers or a subwoofer and a pair of 6 x9 enclosures All that can be circumvented by inconveniently using the incorrect size for the available speaker mounting Of course unless you really know what you re doing Mr Car Stereo Installer will charge you around 50 to make sizers so that they fit properly As far as automobiles go I would consider myself an audiophile and car audio is the major concern that leads me to think negatively about this particular truck For some reason Ford insists on using 5 x7 speakers in many of their light trucks If a subwoofer were to be installed along with that amplifier the entire jack assembly behind the seat needs to be removed Due to this my jack is now underneath my passenger seat Not a real problem but lets say another amp were added for better fidelity and volume two amps and a subwoofer enclosure are almost impossible to fit behind the seats in this narrow cab
Neg,To make a long story short after being given the run around by rude people at the Ford motor company and my insurance would not not_cover not_all not_the not_amount not_owed not_on not_the not_truck not_I not_drove not_an not_old not_car not_of not_my not_moms not_for not_2 not_and not_1 not_2 not_months and still no replacement I will never consider another Ford vehicle of any type again Then the air bag came out about the size of a basket ball and burst there I was lying on the drivers side and this nasty smoke coming out of the air bag about to choke me to death I turned off the ignition because the smoke alarmed me and I thought the thing was on fire I bought a new Ford Ranger four door last day of June this year actually it was a lease purchase type of deal Red Carpet I paid 2 600 cash down and I had a four hundred dollar discount coupon making my total down 3 000 I noticed right away that it road walked and didnt not_handle not_well not_on not_curves not_I not_had not_traded not_in not_a not_little not_Nissan and it handled like a dream on curves with this Ranger I had to go slower than the curve sign amount of miles suggested Also every little bump in the road the rear end would like bounce off to the right or left road walk and at high speeds it would feel like I was about to loose control sometimes and startle me I convinced myself at first that it was just the difference between a big truck and a little one then I decided I would take it in on my next days off and get it checked since it was a fifty mile drive I never got the chance on the way home from work one morning I had a right rear blow out and rolled the pick up after only having it two weeks
Neg,Ok heres the story A relative ordered a 1999 Ford Ranger XLT4WD loaded She gets it out and then something else goes wrong Ok so you say you didnt not_actually not_OWN not_this not_truck She was so excited and she had been a faithful Ford buyer for 40 years She waited and waited and waited finally after many delays it comes in and yes its a nice looking truck Those were the good ole days Buyer beware it aint like it used to be It has lots of features BUT after a couple of weeks its in the shop for one thing or another You cant not_always not_get not_a not_loaner not_Engine not_problems not_wiring not_problems not_plastic not_parts not_break not_off not_in not_cab not_Seat not_adjusters not_wont not_work This goes on for months thank goodness she has more than one vehicle or she would be in bad shape And just to let you know I have owned several Fords in the past both cars and trucks and were happy with them Also the tailgate is hard to latch it doesnt seem to fit well ive stated before that I am not not_the not_owner Be advised that she did buy the extended warranty and is very glad that she did She will Not be buying another Ford truck in the future This truck MAY have been a lemon but keep this is mind within the first year the engine had to be replaced wiring worked on a c repaired door lock replaced twice and other miscellaneous repairs Sorry Ford lovers maybe Ford was good in the 70s but now they have really lost it on quality Nice looking truck maybe but when will you get to drive it when its always in the shop Thank heavens so I dont not_have not_to not_worry not_about not_the not_expenses but whenever I drive the vehicle it drives fine Without knowing the history of this vehicle I would assume that it was great so please ask questions if you consider buying one She continues to have problems and this not not_even to mention the Firestone tires that had to be replaced Sorry again Ford Lovers Another UPDATE 7 01 Ignition had to be replaced Wind blows through the truck like a window is slightly cracked but you cant not_seem not_to not_find not_out not_where not_the not_air not_leak not_is not_A not_loud not_whistling not_noise You are right but this is not not_the not_first not_Ford not_Ranger not_she not_has not_had and after awhile they start falling apart I was a witness to this I know that they are rated highly but please investigate before you purchase that is a lot of money to spend to have it in the repair shop all the time UPDATE 11 8 00 I have been getting a lot of feedback on this rating but I stick to my original opinion
Neg,That leads me to my last complaint Resale value I purchased my 1999 Ford Ranger new in June of 1999 This brought me into the dealership again where after examination they determined that it was a snapped bolt in the driveshaft assembly This truck had a sticker price when new of 19 135 00 I know American cars depreciate faster than foreign models but give me a break This problem was fixed under warranty but disturbed me a bit as the truck had only 20 000 miles on it Shortly after that I received a flat tire on a road going aprox 40mph This truck only had 26 000 miles on it at the time of trade I shopped numerous dealerships and looked at several different model cars I just broke even on my balance due Ford of aprox 11 000 00 My truck was in showroom condition I guess you get what you pay for My final word is if your looking for an inexpensive truck that gets you from point a to and you can handle constant quirks buy a Ford Ranger Otherwise shop around It was a four wheel drive flareside regular cab with the xlt and off road package Let me start off by saying that Ford offers excellent financing I got 2 9 they also offer competitive rebates Usually you have to choose either the rebate or the low finance rate After careful inspection by a mechanic it was discovered that the tire went flat due to a faulty valve im glad I was only going 40mph Gas mileage for me was slightly below the sticker I consistently got 18 20mph with mostly highway driving While economy and truck do not not_usually not_go not_together not_I not_was not_disturbed not_by not_the not_fact not_that not_full not_size not_Chevrolets not_average not_25mpg not_with not_larger not_engines not_than not_my not_Ranger not_I not_had not_the not_3 not_0 not_V6 not_Overall not_I not_liked not_the not_truck not_but not_not not_enough not_to not_keep not_it not_Rising not_gas not_prices not_and not_disappointments not_led not_me not_to not_trade not_my not_truck not_for not_a not_new not_Honda not_2001 not_Civic not_see not_my not_review In addition to the affordability I chose my truck because of its looks and style From the day I drove off the lot I got compliments on what a cool truck I had Initially I was pleased with my truck After a few months I started noticing creaks in the dash this seemed unusual for a truck so new I also received a recall notice from Ford for a faulty wiper switch which if not not_replaced not_could not_short not_out not_the not_system not_Into not_Ford not_I went for this problem to be fixed A few months later my entire truck began to shake above 50mph
Neg,That was the elation I experienced for 12 000 miles My relationship with that truck is like looking back on old girlfriends from my youth Thats damn good when you consider those off road racers rebuild those truck after each race By the way to this day I still remember the salesman saying You ll be a Ford man for life so far hes been right So now I go through a few used vehicle wondering if buying new is worth it NEW Ranger 21991 just broke up with a girl and replace her with a truck A little To give you the sense of reckless abandon that 19 yr old drove his truck with remember in Ferris Buellers Day Off the parking attendants faces in the Ferrai as it was flying through the air The times I had and the memories I would never want removed but I could never have that type of a relationship with a vehicle again and have never had all four off the ground with any other vehicle in my life since Right now I drive a 1999 Ranger 4X4 x cab 4dr 4 0L but Id like to go back to my first in 1986 when I as 19 NEW Ranger 1 My dad co signed for my first new truck I bought a 86 Ranger standard cab 4X4 STX with one of the first push button 4X4 systems I thought that was way cool back then As far as longevity goes for this one I cant not_say but I know it could take a lot Being a stupid 19yr old kid and adding a 100 000 mi bumper to bumper that I was told would cover any thing I drove it as if I was Mickey Thompson I lived to get all fours off the ground and being a 19yr old party animal in a rural community I found opportunity practically daily I was 4by n with a friend in this truck and making those tv commercials appear tame and in the mist of roaring laughter and fast paced action my friend turns to me and says next time around let me out I reply you scared and he says no ive only seen this on tv and this was daily with this truck being reckless I totaled it with 12 000 mi on it and it NEVER SAW A SHOP ONCE
Neg,This current beast is an entirely different animal When I did some investigating I found even more features Now I bet you re wondering if drive my vehicles hard NOT AT ALL Then came the recalls 1 Steering column wiper blinkers assembly 2 water pump 3 THE TIRES which I must ad are horrible quality It began to make questionable noises within my first year of ownership im 6ft1 and a little too big for the interior Very uncomfortable and the seats did a number on my back I have owned this rolling nightmare for 30 months and I only have 14 K miles on it All of which are basic city driving To William Clay Ford get to work you silver spooner you just lost another customer I owned two Ford Rangers First 1989 STX Ext Cab and currently 1999 Ranger Standard Cab Both 4WD Something has happened in those 11 years First Ranger I drove for 8 years Ran great 4WD worked well nice bucket seats solid build good turning radius but a bit under powered

Neg,It felt very comfortable The seats were plush and comfortable The automatic transmission was very smooth The windows came down at an average pace The deep blue interior matched the sky blue exterior very nicely The 96 T Bird does not not_have not_a not_Manual not_transmission not_option The trunk release was very nice on the key ring My mothers Blazer has a 4300 Vortec V6 with an automatic transmission The dash is well laid out with the speedometer and tachometer It is a good price lots of features very comfortable The power is ok and it is a gorgeous car It shifted delicately and wasnt not_constantly not_searching not_for not_the not_right not_gear The trunk space was adequate but the seat would not not_fold not_down It had power windows door locks and mirrors that worked well The dealer said that you could not not_get not_fog not_lights not_for not_this not_vehicle There are lots of wires running around and other intrusive things Of course from here I had to make fun of it constantly When I tried to engage the fog lights the head light dial came apart This car came with a CD player from the factory in 1996 as well as an alarm keyless entry This one didnt not_According not_to not_the not_salesman not_the not_government not_had not_outlawed not_them not_for not_two not_reasons The rear seat offered a lot more room than I was expecting similar to my Blazer It was easily put back on but it was surprising the cheap quality of the plastic Cons It would be easy to fall asleep in the back seats Easily sitting four people comfortably The transmission drive shaft hump and the distance the center consol came back made the center seat useless My legs were not not_cramped not_the not_seat not_was not_easily not_adjustable not_Both not_of not_my not_arms not_were not_rested not_nicely The keyless entry was just as good as any ive seen from the factory Poor range but at least it was there This disappointed me because I think it would look very aggressive with a set close to the ground It only shifted down if I really hit the gas im certain a significant amount of power was lost here This is a decent number especially when you can have as much fun in this car as you can This car did not not_afford not_the not_gas not_mileage not_I not_would not_hope not_for but the salesman insisted that it would get 22 mpg city The headrests left something to be desired although im sure they could be adjusted with a bit of force Timing would be a breeze though with the location of the distributor the salesman called it something else but I cant not_recall To open the hood took a bit of effort something that you would not not_grow not_accustomed not_to not_This would only be a minor inconvenience This is the most beautiful car Ford ever designed Compared to this the Mustang is a pug nosed box Neutral My friends 1989 Turbo had automatic seatbelts These are few the only thing I noticed was that the engine was kind of crammed into the engine bay Maintenance could be difficult The GMC was a manual and I couldnt keep the rear end on the ground I could feel much more power being put on the ground with the manual transmission The speedometer goes to 120 mph and im certain this car could do it It even sounded pretty nice a little on the whiny side but still an agressive sound It will squawk the tires from a standstill I drove an S15 Sonoma with a 4 3 Liter V6 with TBI Throttle Body Injection that yielded 28 hp over the Vortec First because when the motor died people could not not_put not_the not_belt not_on not_Second not_because not_the not_pillar not_was not_too not_far not_forward and instead of holding someone back at the chest it would move up to their throats One day she had enough of it and took me for a ride I never made fun of it again Pros The 1996 Thunderbird LX I test drove was definitely a well equipped car The steering wheel had an adjustable height which the salesman insisted I had too high I lowered it and felt cramped but where I initially had it it was very nice The manual safetybelts were an inconvenience but I can definitely see their pros Although the driver seat felt as though it would be comfortable for long trips it did not not_offer not_Lumbar not_support not_A not_pillow not_would not_fix not_that not_problem If this car came with a manual transmission I would probably purchase one I discussed the new T Bird with the sales man he said he really liked the styling I for one strongly disagree with Fords design in this new car You can get a 95 T Bird Supercoupe with manual transmission but with the supercharged V6 your insurance is going to skyrocket I cant not_believe not_Ford not_put not_only not_automatic not_transmissions not_in not_a not_car not_that

not_vehicle not_off not_of not_my not_list not_of not_prospective not_purchases not_in not_the not_next not_month not_or not_so not_It not_all started when a girl in my study hall started bragging about hers The spare tire was a donut when it appeared that a full size could have fit The size of the rear tires 255 mm across made it impossible to spin or even squawk the tires Admittedly you dont not_need not_to not_do not_this but it is always nice to be able to make some noise Perhaps in a Turbo V6 or V8 version The trunk release in the car was kind of hard to find but under the armrest is a nice place after you know where it is at The 3 8 L V6 with Fuel Injection put a hefty amount of power to the ground for a non turbo V6 in a medium weight car Id estimate quarter mile time to be about 18 and 0 60 time to be about 13 seconds The rear wheel drive was the culprit named by the salesman in the lost gas mileage im not not_sure not_how not_this not_could not_have not_effected not_it but he did seem to know a lot about cars Handling was a dream I was darting in and out of traffic to the dismay of the salesman with no body roll I took a Clover Leaf onramp at 80 mph and a car could not

defogger and nice windshield wipers your view would be unobstructed For a coupe there was a good bit of visibility both by looking back or in the mirrors I did not not_check not_the not_blind not_spots but they seem like it would be a very small space
Neg,The seats were like Barcaloungers soft and squishy It did prove very durable and quite comfortable The stereo was horrid but very easy to replace including the awful little speakers This was probably the most important money I put in the car The build quality inside was decent very plastic looking effects and velour everywhere They didnt not_promote not_great not_posture and after long trips it made my back a bit sore I owned a 1996 Thunderbird LX v6 for 8 months and heres my first impression fun for the city smooth on the highway but im not not_sad not_I not_sold not_it not_The not_engine not_is not_a not_low not_horsepower not_high not_torque not_v6 not_3 not_8 not_liters not_with not_only not_145hp The only repair I had was when the torque converter acted up and made the car shake in 3rd and 4th gear Turns out the fluid used by Ford was less than optimal and a change to synthetic fixed the problem as recommended by Ford Motor Company It does have 220 ft lbs of torque so it pushes you back in your seat leaping from stoplight to stoplight Get it on the freeway and this big v6 can hardly hit 100 I would say acceleration is good up to 55 then it tapers off The trunk was voluminous but backseat space was pretty small Front seat room was huge lots of room over my head The Automatic transmission was one of the better ones ive driven always shifting at about the right spot Occasionally on the highway it would disengage gears and rev the motor while trying to kick down for passing speed which was a little un nerving The car did not not_have not_anti not_lock not_brakes not_an not_airbag not_or not_a not_limited not_slip not_differential not_all not_of not_which not_were not_promised not_by not_the not_salesman not_Dont not_go not_to not_a not_Ford not_dealer not_I not_would not_rate not_the not_mechanical not_quality not_of not_the not_car not_at not_good not_the not_interior not_at not_average not_I not_sold not_the not_car not_and not_bought not_an not_Audi not_Coupe not_Quattro not_the not_ownership not_of not_which not_I not_have not_not not_regretted not_for not_a not_moment not_I not_will not_rate not_it not_not not_recommended not_just not_because not_I not_wouldnt not_go not_out not_of not_my not_way not_to not_drive not_one not_again not_it not_was not_good not_but not_there not_are not_better not_out not_there
Neg,Its a way of life This is a true sports car The latest gift is a leather Jacket The SVT folks treat you right also The only negatives is the noise level inside the car The new IRS make the car handle like it is on rails This is to be expected with a true performance car but it gets old on road trips What other car can you purchase for under 30 k that has a hand built engine My wife had always wanted a Mustang so last year we bought one of the first 99 Cobras off the truck Our Cobra is a rio red coupe with medium parchment interior I had some experiences with the Mustangs of the late 80s but there is no comparison
Neg,Bare with me auto experts if I dont not_explain not_something not_adequately Oh but the funs only beginning My Ford Explorer 29 000 miles young needs what You guessed it tires You know us woman brake shoes shoulder pads whats the difference right smile All right on to the 36 000 mile mark what New tires AGAIN So that lifetime alignment I purchased the up keep on the alignment rotation oil changes fuel injector cleanings etc etc really havent helped MUCH in the long run It dies where it dies just the towing expenses alone would have been horrible if it hadnt been covered under my insurance When I went to the Ford dealership to find out what was wrong with the vehicle they told me that the battery was old OLD HUH And a muffler etc etc and so on Seems as though the older Ford Explorer models have front alignment problems which cause the tires to wear uneven etc Two months is OLD Come to find out the manufacture put a 1991 battery that was probably sitting around in some warehouse begging for a sucker thats me to get stuck with him in my 1993 vehicle The biggest problem with having something go wrong with your Ford for those of you who drive Explorers im sure you ll agree the Explorer would NOT start would not not_start not_long not_enough not_for not_me not_to not_drive not_it not_ANY not_WHERE ive had my Ford Explorer now since 1993 Its been every where from Washington DC to Miami FL where it was purchased to Alabama and now here to sunny yeah right San Diego I must say that it would have been cheaper renting a car during my long travels rather then pay for the repairs on my Ford Two months after I first purchased the vehicle I had to call road side assistance because of a dead battery At 135 dollars a pop guess ole Firestone loved that WRONG manufactures defect on the tires the treads were separating with no signs of normal wear and tear Joyous something free for a change 34 000 miles young ahhh you need a new starter we have a re call on your side mirror something about catching on fire blah blah blah and low and behold you need not not_only new brake pads but the entire brake system needs replacing for you southern Californians I guess its what Brake Depot would call a break system nightmare Well at least it was still under warranty but boy are the mechanics at Ford and I becoming close friends On to the grand finale at 65 000 miles still young I had the pleasure of experiencing a Ford transmission failure unfortunately I was in the process of driving when it happened 1 800 00 dollars to re vive my Ford hard parts soft parts you name it my transmission needed it Now I know that in order to maintain the driving performance on your vehicle you have to service it and take care of it but in my case ive basically bought enough parts to build a brand new Explorer over the past 7 years I know that 7 years seems like a long time but the majority of this work was done during the first three years of my little guys life I would DEFINITELY not not_recommend not_someone not_purchasing not_an not_older not_model not_Explorer not_did not_I not_mention not_the not_fact not_that not_ive not_had not_my not_tires not_replaced not_8 not_TIMES not_ive not_heard not_some not_really not_great not_stories not_from not_friends not_who not_have not_the not_newer not_Explorers but because of all of the problems that ive had with this little baby I wont be trading him in for a newer model I might just try my luck with a Honda
Neg,On road at the speed limit the car is adequate The vacuum lines have all decayed so they had to be replaced The shocks were also replaced because the car was rolling diving and squating too much The truck actually isnt not_an not_awful not_handler but body roll is severe and it really bucks over bumps My truck was also purple so that may be a small factor in my point of view Interior Then I realized the shocks were fine because the new ones didnt not_control not_body not_motions not_at not_all not_Misc No airbags no traction control no stability control only pre tensioning safety belts Overall All in all I hate the truck One thing that really bugs me about the Explorer is that it has absolutely almost no safety features On easy or moderate off roading the Explorer is alright however on severe off road conditions it falls apart The seat belts also rattle against the doors and almost all interior trim panels can be wiggled by hand and mostly pried away from their mounting surfaces The truck bucks violently and generally feels like its about to break Performance Well the engine is a 170 horsepower V6 in a 4000 lb truck The cargo pad or whatever you want to call it is attached by velcro to velcro fasteners which are glued onto plastic You d also think the visors wouldnt not_be not_cracked not_and not_falling not_down and that the car would get better than 14 mpg maybe 20 if I had a lighter foot Dive the front end going down when braking is terribly pronounced Squat the front end going up under acceleration is not not_bad but thats more a factor of the anemic engine than the suspension The seats are fairly comfortable and theres enough room for 4 5s a stretch and the middle rear seat absolutely sucks because of the always trying to retract lap belt that locks as tight as possible The main problem with the interior is that like many Detroit products it isnt not_well not_built not_Plastics not_screwed not_onto not_plastics not_screwed not_onto not_metal is a great recipe for squeaks and the Explorer definitely evinces these My view is slightly skewed because my parents had Mercedes and BMWs and wouldnt not_even not_buy not_a not_newer not_Explorer but hey the truck really is a poor choice for anyone Please dont not_get not_suckered not_into not_buying not_one However as I had the car when I was 16 and stupid I know what it will do at more than double the speed limit and that is feel like its going to tip All in all even if you expected a poor performing vehicle this one sucks Exterior I personally dont not_like not_the not_slab not_sided not_blunt not_ended not_aerodynamics not_of not_a not_brick not_look but hey thats subjective Objectively it isnt not_helping not_fuel not_economy These gave way within a few months so now I have no cargo pad And both passenger side air vents are broken because Ford couldnt be bothered to make them out of metal so they were constructed from cheap flimsy plastic like most of the inside The brakes on this truck are awful made even worse by a capricious ABS system which will activate in the dry going less than 10 mph or not not_activate not_at not_40 not_mph not_when not_its not_wet not_and not_causing not_the not_car not_to not_go not_sideways not_I not_could not_see not_straight not_ahead not_through not_the not_passenger not_side not_window The thing always has something wrong Lately its been the power door locks not not_being not_powered not_anymore and the center console working its way loose so I can shake it about 3 in either direction this of course is another example of plastic screwed onto metal which just destroys the plastic giving it the play Why couldnt it be adjustable Because Ford motor company hates you The mirror in the drivers side visor is also broken because my mother put the window up when it was sticking out That WAS partially her fault but why couldnt Ford install some sort of stop on the thing Because Ford is run by fools Reliability Well it hasnt been good With 80 000 miles in 10 years you d think the radiator wouldnt not_have not_blown It accelerates slowly from any speed and highway merging must be done at full throttle or you risk endangering people in the right lane I did a few mods to the truck a performance ha airbox a dual exhaust and a chip Id guess it had 180 horsepower after all that Maybe 185 Anyway nothing you can do short of an engine swap will make it accelerate fast Even after all those mods the thing couldnt even squeal its tires in a straight line unless it was raining And its not not_just not_the not_engine Okay im 19 and ive been driving this death trap for 3 years previously it was driven by my mother so nothing you read is because of abuse at least not long time abuse I have to say anybody who says this is a good truck is so completely wrong that you might as well not not_read not_the not_review not_at not_all not_if not_they not_say not_so not_It not_is not_an not_AWFUL not_truck not_Whats not_wrong not_Hmmm

Neg,We had it towed to a transmission place We inherited a 1993 Ford Explorer in December of 1998 We drove this car to Colorado from Texas and prayed the whole way They will be able to tell you much better than I am He told us that he installs at least five new transmissions on Explorers a week It would start but when we put it in to drive it stalled It was great until it had about 100 000 miles on it and just stopped at a red light He then told us how lucky we were because we got an extra 20 000 miles out of the old transmission It was a pretty good car up to that point other than the fact that its small engine cant not_go not_up not_hills not_very not_easily It barely made it there and back struggling the whole way I urge you to call a transmission shop before you buy an Explorer When we called the mechanic he said Let me guess it has between 70 80 000 miles on it We said no that it had about 100 000
Neg,My husband HAD to have this vehicle My husband and I bought our Ford Explorer XLT in 1993 This has been a cost of over 600 dollars At 36 k miles I had to replace the tires The computer died and had to be replaced Fortunately it was still under warranty and it didnt not_cost not_me not_anything The passenger side rear door handle broke and will not not_open not_from not_the not_inside not_Again not_I not_know not_other not_Explorer not_owners not_who not_had not_this not_problem It was great driving it when it was new but my husband drove it mostly until he obtained a company car and we sold our other car and I now owned this Explorer The paint on the hood of the vehicle started to crack from underneath the clearcoat Not to mention the many recalls I also had to have the thermostat replaced because the vehicle started to run hot replaced may batteries The vehicle began to shimmy and I have had the tires rotated balanced aligned and to no avail I have talked to other Explorer owners who have had the same problem and Ford could not not_fix not_the not_problem not_I not_have not_also not_had not_to not_replace not_routers not_every not_time not_I not_have not_had not_a not_break not_job not_done Have had to replace the bushings because they are located too close to the engine and this causes them to melt faster I will be needing to replace them again soon at a cost of over 150 I have also had the experience of riding in an Expedition and I felt the same vibration starting on it as I felt on the Explorer when we bought it I feel that the Expedition will have the same problems as the Explorer
Neg,The leather is of lowest quality It had the works and let me tell you about these works There were VERY few things that satisfied me about this truck The constipated roar that lurkes beneath the hood is nothing but empty power It comes with air holes poked all over the seat which look very cheap This rig is about as nimble as a 747 Watch out for the roll factor when cornering at what you think is a reasonable speed The Explorer has an extremely high center of gravity which makes it one of the most flipped automobiles on the road today dispite the minimal ground clearance Ford has found a way to still make the Explorer unsafe I bought this vehicle thinking i could take it on long trips access remote vacationing areas and hauling my boat What I got was a gas guzzling snail The Ford Explorer provides absolutely no power and is capable of nothing While unsafe for street driving it lacks the ground clearance for off road use i bet i could find a Ferrari with more ground clearance than that of the Ford Explorer I bought this car fully loaded
Neg,On that point I am indeed satisfied This was a nightmare in and of itself but thats another story all together The armrest that sits between the passenger and driver has even broken off So now I just lay the arm rest where it was once secured in place At 96 000 miles the manual transmission went out and that had to be replaced with a rebuilt one These are the major problems that ive had Along the way a number of other issues have popped up as well Oh yes the tape deck has always been screwy sometimes eating my tapes ever since about 20 000 miles on I dont not_even not_bother not_with not_it anymore This cost about 1800 to get fixed Luckily it was covered under an extended warranty through my insurance company that was about to expire at 100 000 miles The handle to my driver side door snapped off at about 90 000 miles and the dashboard vents to the AC have broken so that you cant not_adjust not_the not_direction not_of not_the not_airflow There was a recall on the emergency brake and there was also a recall on the rear window Additionally it seems like the plastics on the inside are really flimsy Theres good news and bad news First with the good news ive managed to squeeze out 165 000 miles from this truck and shes still running Thats more than a lot of other people can say for their vehicles At about 130 000 miles the 4x4 went bad so I cant not_use not_that not_anymore not_Around not_115 not_000 not_miles not_the not_air not_conditioner not_went not_bad not_Not not_knowing not_how not_much not_further not_this not_vehicle not_would not_last not_I not_decided not_not not_to not_get not_the not_1000 not_dollar not_repair not_Had not_I not_not not_had not_those not_previous not_problems not_I not_probably not_would not_have not_pitched not_in not_the not_1000 not_dollars not_to not_get not_the not_AC not_fixed not_Oh not_well not_hindsight not_is not_20 not_20 All in all im glad to say that I was able to squeeze out 165 000 miles from this and believe it or not not_my not_last not_30 not_000 not_miles have been less troublesome than my first 30 000 miles Even with soooo many miles im hesitant to try another one of these again considering the problems its had Since it did actually get me 165 000 miles im giving this a 3 and not not_a not_lower not_score not_Good not_luck The bad news ive also had quite a few problems along the way I ll start by saying that I would be cautious about buying one of these trucks used During my first 36 000 miles I had to have a couple of repairs done to the front axle From about miles through 40 000 100 000 I had random problems with the electrical system that caused it to not not_start not_I not_dont not_mind not_paying not_to not_get not_a not_vehicle not_fixed but I absolutely cant not_stand not_being not_stranded not_by not_my not_vehicle
Neg,But the problems didnt not_end not_there not_for not_me not_of not_course My brothers Ranger has also had this problem although he only had to replace his sensor once It all started with an attempted break in while my friend and I were at a hockey game If there is one thing that has stood the test of time with my truck its the drivers seat The most expensive one time problem I have had with my truck was a couple of years ago at around 75 000 KMS 46 000 Miles In addition to these problems I have had plenty of minor problems such as the engine mis firing at higher speeds above 100 KPH 62 MPH but most were covered by the original warranty or a recent repair warranty When you sit and just look at it it really looks good Too bad it doesnt do a whole lot of good for me to just sit and look at it The seats are fantastic 60 40 split bench The funny thing is someone even tried to steal my truck back in 1996 but they gave up pretty quick for some reason I suspect I now know why i NOTE Prices in Canadian Dollars The Good Stuff About My Truck Its a great looking truck It is very comfortable for those long drives my parents live 6 hours away from Calgary and the upholstery is quite durable Have never had any stain problems and everything is very easy to clean I tend to take a lot of stuff when I travel On the bright side since the repairs have been done I have had no further engine problems knock on wood Shortly after my 60 000 KM 37 000 Miles warranty ran out on my truck I encountered a couple of annoying problems my headlights wouldnt not_turn not_on and my door ajar sensor would stick for up to a half hour Oh the sweet sounds of DING DING DING DING If my truck had been a boat I doubt I would have made it out of the port I have had so many problems with my 1995 Ford Ranger XLT Supercab since purchasing it brand new that its a wonder it hasnt just spontaneously combusted but with my luck I probably would have been sitting in it if that would have happened The fuel efficiency on my truck is also not not_too not_bad not_especially not_for not_a not_truck not_I not_dont not_know not_exactly not_what not_it not_is but I can generally make it around 500 KMS 310

moving stuff out of his old apartment causing damage to my windshield wipers and hood Cost 600 For some reason one day when I went to switch my headlights to high beam the system shorted out and all I had left was the daylight driving lights Cost to repair 300 And then there is the door ajar sensor ive had to replace it twice because it kept sticking on no matter what I tried to fix it Cost to repair Around 200 each time The last one im going to mention is the doozy of the whole stack I had brake problems as usual back in 1999 and took them to a local mechanic to be serviced Upon leaving I noticed my breaks were making a ton of noise so I went back only to find out they had screwed the job up So a few hours later everything was supposed to be completely fixed So we upgraded the alarm to

not_thank not_goodness The next incident I had with the truck was a near severe accident I was driving back to Calgary from visiting my parents in my home town and while driving down the highway I watched in horror as a fully loaded dump truck ran a stop sign heading right in my path I actually yanked the steering wheel and skidded down the highway at a 90 degree angle avoiding an accident I got off the highway and the guy walked over to me and profusely apologized for 5 minutes while I tried to calm down What I found out when I had the truck towed to Ford where I had NOT had the repairs done at was that someone had put oil in my master cylinder this thing regulates the break fluid for your vehicle I actually still have the one with the oil in it in my possession I had service done at both Ford and a local mechanic within a two week time period so there was no way to squarely place the blame on either one or so I was told So I headed home I was supposed to head across the city via our major freeway to pick up a friend after the repairs were done but he canceled at the last minute so I just headed home thankfully Upon returning home I decided to head to the nearby grocery store to grab some stuff and when I was a few blocks away from my house my breaks completely failed I had none I quickly kicked the truck into 2nd and 1st gears to slow down and coasted home luckily there was very little traffic around at the time The thief had attempted to knock out the passenger side door lock with a screw driver or something but had failed I suspect the truck probably growled at the would be thief or something and scared him off I swiftly responded to the attempted break in with the installation of a car alarm After shopping around for a decent price I settled on A Sound in NE Calgary for my alarm choice I left my truck for the day and the alarm was installed End of story Nope I had to return 3 more times because the alarm did not not_agree not_with not_my not_truck and would false constantly My truck wouldnt not_start not_a not_couple not_of not_times and I was informed by my mechanic I had to have my head gaskets rebuilt at a cost of over 1000 Apparently there was

Neg,And a trip to South Carolina Myrtle Beach It cost 12 799 with all the financial stuff My son at the time was 15 and my daughter was 12 The last big trip was from Tennessee to Oklahoma and then back They checked the radiator and other items like brakes etc but not not_the not_problem Then the wipers went off on their own back to the dealership covered by warranty By this time I was wondering if I had made a good decision about this truck They were most uncomfortable and had to take turns riding up front And I liked the price At that time it was traded for a much more comfortable vehicle for our growing family of 5 We bought a Plymouth Grand Voyager van See my review on it please What I liked about this truck at the time I bought it was that we could all fit into it However for my older kids the fold down jump seats in the back section were uncomfortable on long trips I purchased a brand new bright red truck in November 1995 my husband said not not_another not_red not_truck not_Yes I like red and I like trucks I had brought home a darker blue truck but it was automatic power windows and other frilly stuff that I didnt not_want not_or not_want not_to not_pay not_extra not_for not_My not_truck had the following features 6 cylinder standard transmission 5 speed anti lock brakes back sliding window long bed A C power steering and a bed liner My truck was not not_a not_reliable not_vehicle not_in not_ice not_it not_froze not_to not_the not_ground and we could not not_budge not_it not_no not_matter not_what not_we not_tried not_hahahhaha not_only not_in not_Tennessee not_right not_Okay not_so not_maybe not_it not_was not_built not_on not_a not_Monday not_maybe not_it not_was not_just not_that not_model not_year But I did not not_buy not_another not_Ford not_truck and I had owned 2 so maybe I ll let Fords rest and get a Toyota or a Chevy next truck purchase After the big trip to Oklahoma it finally broke and it was a carrier bearing My mechanic basically told me that this was a design flaw since the drive shaft was not not_so not_long not_it not_didnt not_really not_need not_to not_be not_built not_like not_this not_Just not_another not_moving not_part not_to not_break not_Once not_all not_of not_the not_electrical not_problems not_were not_repaired not_and not_the not_carrier not_bearing not_was not_repaired not_the not_truck not_was not_very not_reliable not_for not_120 not_000 not_miles This was the third vehicle that I bought at Woody Anderson Ford in Huntsville AL And If I still lived there I probably would have traded it there and bought another Ford product I was faithful about regular maintenance but this silly truck had a mind of its own First it was the door open chime it just would not not_shut not_off not_Back not_to not_the not_dealership not_it not_was not_covered not_under not_the not_warranty Then the interior light would not not_shut not_off not_my not_husband not_just not_got not_a not_potholder not_from not_the not_kitchen not_and not_yanked not_the not_bulb not_out not_He not_was not_beginning not_to not_be not_frustrated not_by not_constant not_trips not_to not_the not_dealer not_for not_little not_electrical not_repairs not_I not_noticed not_a not_smell not_around not_35 not_000 not_miles not_or not_so not_Something not_was not_hot not_under not_my not_truck not_I not_took not_it not_in not_and not_asked not_them not_if not_there not_was not_anything not_under not_there not_that not_might not_get not_hot not_during not_driving
Neg,The response is imprecise The brakes are horrid It heft is completely artificial It was in a major accident once The steering lacks any sort of feel The fabrics used are not not_much better Yet my old bruiser drives way better than the Taurus You ll be glad you did Thankfully the trunk is big albeit with a high liftover Exterior And for you skiers out there the seat does not not_fold not_down Too bad it blocks the low mounted stereo which has really small buttons The back seat is pretty roomy but like the fronts they offer very little comfort and support This GL model has a power drivers seat but surprisingly has no controls for the all important thigh support The controls are fairly well laid out and the cupholder design is great IT HOLDS CUPS The Taurus has perfectly safe handling but the driving experience is numb and devoid of any sense of fun In fact it held on to the position until 1997 when the Toyota Camry won the sales race The suspension is tuned for a smooth ride but its softness contributes to more body roll than is comfortable The overall quality of materials is quite bad The plastic used on the dash and door panels just screams low buck It was soon junked Sorry it took my almost a year to inform you all of this Handling Steering braking D As far as looks go the older Taurus was not not_bad not_In not_late not_1985 not_when not_the not_original not_Taurus not_made not_its not_debut not_it not_was not_cutting not_edge How would it compare to the last older Taurus I drove Powertrain C This Taurus like so may others had the venerable 3 0 liter pushrod Vulcan V6 The 1992 restyle made it look even better and more upscale Even today it looks somewhat modern if pretty generic Its a tried and true styling effort that certainly wont offend anybody This engine makes quite a lot of noise for not not_much grunt and it knocked pretty bad The performance is not not_helped not_by not_a not_transmission not_that not_shifts not_too not_soon not_for not_my not_tastes It is better built better engineered and a whole lot more comfortable Plus its fun and has better resale value The Honda Accord Nissan Maxima and Toyota Camry are even better So Id say skip the Taurus It was good for about 140 horsepower Keep in mind that the Taurus was amongst the bigger midsizers of its time so it was not not_surprising not_that not_this not_3 not_0 not_liter not_was not_not not_quite not_up not_to not_the not_job In this car the wheel arches intrude exactly where I like to keep my left foot whereas my Mazda has plenty of foot room The Fords seats provide very little support and are not not_comfortable not_even not_on not_short not_trips The early 90s were good for Ford Sales were strong recalls were few Firestone tires were the norm and there was nothing wrong with that By 1992 the Taurus had overtaken the Honda Accord as the best selling car in America But when I got behind the wheel of the Taurus I discovered that I have it made in my 93 Mazda 626 My Mazda was one of the smallest cars in the class back then however it has a lot more front legroom than the Taurus The pedal feels spongy and I had to apply way more pressure than normally do

not_expected not_to not_be not_impressed not_by not_the not_interior not_room The shift quality is poor either it clunks or it slips just a bit Taurus transmissions are legendary for failure and malfunction Being that this example only had 72 000 miles made all the less encouraging Update As of August 2002 this Taurus blew its tranny with only 76 000 miles So many family sedans of this era had started to become more engaging to drive The Nissan Maxima and Honda Accord were the sportiest the Toyota Camry was the smoothest the Mazda 626 and Nissan Altima being somewhere in between But Ford tuned the Taurus to appeal to those who consider a car to be just an appliance So what was it about the Taurus that made it sell so well Was it the looks the performance the quality the price I had only one encounter of an older Taurus before last week a beat up 1989 model that a friend of mine used to own Last week I got to drive a 1993 Taurus GL with only 71 000 miles The same could not

Neg,Back in 1997 we purchased a 1993 Ford Taurus Wagon We purchased the car because we needed a larger car for our family The car had problems the moment we drove it off the lot As we were driving down the expressway in our new car the Oxygen sensors went out meaning the car would stall out going 65 MPH We called the dealership and they fixed them assuring us that the car had been very well taken care of and this was just a strange coincidence Well 2 weeks later the brakes went out so we got them fixed Then the head gasket went out And now the transmission is out in it We have only had this car for a little over 2 years and we have sunk more money into it than we had to pay for it even though we had a warranty I will make sure a mechanic checks out the next car I purchase and I would advice anyone to do the same
Neg,They eventually will break down When the planetaries go your car will not not_move This problem has also been indicated by Ford through a TSB This vehicle has also used the Essex 3 8 litre V 6 engine However there have been reports of leaks even with the improvements One way to check the transmissions condition is to check the fluids condition There have been two serious problems with the Taurus and Sable vehicles Mainly its the transmission If you were moving when those gears go you will coast to a stop An electronic version called the AXOD E have been used in the redesigned Taurus and Sable vehicles from 1992 to 1995 When the piston goes the car will not not_upshift not_properly not_if not_at not_all not_These not_transmissions not_do not_not not_provide not_adequate not_lubrication not_to not_the not_planetaries If its cherry red it may still be good although the fluid could have been replaced to cover up a transmission problem These transmissions have used an aluminum accumulator piston which has been known to crack Fords TSB Technical Service Bulletin indicates that the aluminum piston must be replaced with a steel one If the oil looks murky and light brown and can even sort of have an appearance like chocolate milk then avoid the car as the head gaskets have leaked Smell the oil If you wish get a SHO model All SHO Tauruses use super reliable Yamaha V 6 engines and some SHOs use manual transmissions which avoids potential transmission problems inherent in the AXOD altogether However When something does go wrong with SHO cars they are expensive to repair if major parts are required as parts for SHO vehicles can be difficult to find The planetaries are a set of orbital gears that transfers the torque from the engine to the wheels Apparently the transmission does not not_distribute not_enough not_fluid not_to not_those not_gears not_that not_they not_overheat If the fluid is brown or brownish with a sharp dirty odor avoid the car as the transmission had been overheated Particularly a concern with cars using the AXOD automatic transmission Check the engines head gasket condition by checking the oil These engines are notorious for developing problems with the head gaskets A lot of vehicles in Fords lineup have used this same engine like V 6 Thunderbird Cougar vehicles and V 6 Mustangs Fortunately these engines are easy to identify Just pop the hood The AXOD and AXOD E automatic transmissions Introduced in 1986 these things have apparently been designed in haste Its noteworthy to mention that this same transmission has also been used in Ford Windstar minivans and I think in Lincoln Continental sedans AXOD transmissions have been used in Taurus and Sable vehicles from 1985 to 1991 The only other company I can think of that is worse in this regard is Kia If you want a second generation Taurus as they are the best looking Tauruses in my opinion opt for the 1995 model as they may have the updates applied to them Also in addition get only a Taurus or Sable with the 3 0 litre Vulcan engine The intake plenum which is a big slab of metal on top of the engine should have this written on it in big letters 3 8 FUEL INJECTED V 6 There is a TSB which lists replacing the head gasket material with an improved version along with replacing the head bolts with ones that have higher torsion to achieve a tighter compression of the gasket for a better seal If it smells burnt avoid the car Burnt oil usually means that the engine had been overheated Overheated engines can develop head gasket problems prematurely and engines with head gasket concerns to begin with should be particularly avoided in this instance Also as always try to obtain all the service papers for the car in order to ascertain how its been taken care of as well as to reveal if any major repairs had been done or not Most leaks seem to occur after flushes of the cooling system Fords execution of recalls to affected vehicles have been less than stellar Model years covered are only 1994 and up Owners of vehicles years 1993 and down are not not_being not_honored not_Off not_topic not_it not_has not_also not_been not_commented not_that not_Ford not_has not_had not_a not_reputation not_for not_lawlessness not_in not_comparison not_to not_other not_American not_car not_companies not_in not_terms not_of not_responsibility not_to not_their not_customers not_in not_the not_event not_that not_a not_potentially not_dangerous not_design not_defect not_becomes not_known not_Ford not_has not_been not_known not_not not_to not_take not_action not_in not_face not_of not_these not_circumstances
Neg,And it stayed that way In April 2000 I purchased a 1993 Taurus LX Wagon with the V6 engine It was priced slightly over the Blue Book price and it was super clean One morning while pulling out of a parking lot the transmission slipped out of gear The mechanic told me that when he opened it up the case was full of shavings My family was growing and I needed a larger safer vehicle I went the way I could afford The odometer read nearly 120 000 miles but when I test drove it the Taurus wagon handled well and rode smoothly Totally without warning the transmission had chewed itself up A remanufactured transmission with a decent warranty cost me 2 100 Add to that over 500 in labor The first monthly payment was due on June 1 2000 Roughly 40 days after the purchase was made a couple weeks before the first monthly payment was due I had a problem It ran quietly and shifted almost unnoticeably I was impressed as was my wife which was very important I made a 1 000 down payment and financed the remaining 3 700 through my bank All for a seven year old vehicle I still owed nearly 5 000 on when interest is added Also at the consignment lot the keyless entry code worked A few months later it didnt and it cost me 45 to get some guy with a slim jim to open the car for me
Neg,It is very roomy for a family of four There is plenty of trunk space and is a comfortable ride for family trips I have a 1993 Ford Taurus with a V6 3 8L engine The Ford Taurus is a nice car My car clearly fit the textbook case of what they were trying to correct with 1994 models As previous reviewers of the Taurus have stated there is no gray area with rules only black and white with Ford It is a low mileage car as it is now close to 7 years old with 61 000 miles of which 11 000 is on the second engine However at 50 000 miles the head gasket cracked Coolant was leaking into the exhaust system causing billowing white smoke to come out of the tail pipe I opted for a rebuilt engine as purchasing another car was out of the question as a car with a cracked head has little trade in value Now Ford has increased the warranty for 1994 and 1995 Taurus vehicles with 3 8L engines to 7 years or 100 000 miles According to the letter if you have already paid to have the head gasket repaired prior to the date of this letter March 2000 you may be entitled to a refund of your repair costs Obviously Ford has had lots of complaints and bad press concerning their 3 8L engine Ann O Neill director of Vehicle Service and Programs even states that Ford is committed to maintaining satisfying and and long term relationships with our valued customers and demonstrating that commitment through actions such as this I guess I am not not_a not_valued not_customer not_as not_Ford not_told not_me not_that not_there not_is not_no not_recourse not_because not_my not_model not_year not_is not_1993
Neg,We learned very quickly It couldnt handle long trips at all This car is a lemon and should be avoided My family had high hopes when we bought our new Taurus from the Ford dealer We thought of the great trips we could it this spacious and quiet car The car was the most unreliable thing we had ever ridden in When we owned it we went on about six long trips with it four of those trips it broke down It is relatively quiet and has a decent amout of space but those are qualities you tend to overlook as you manuver through the oveflow baggage from the small trunk in an attempt to get out of the car to examine the broken engine Actually the transmission gave us the majority of the problems
Neg,I have the misfortune of having purchased one of these vehicles about a year and a half ago It is a 1993 Taurus Wagon Top of the line fully loaded black and very pretty to look at Unfortunately I have only been able to drive the car for about 5 000 miles since I purchased it First the steering went out 900 next it was the head gasket 1 700 not not_to not_mention various other minor repairs The last tow truck driver informed me that he tows the Ford Taurus more often than any other car and the garage concurred I was warned that the transmissions often go out in these cars and alas that prediction came true yesterday I have decided to donate the car to charity I would not not_recommend not_this not_car not_to not_anyone
Neg,The dealership wanted 445 for that work That cost 120 FROM A JUNKYARD NOT THE DEALERSHIP That cost 180 for one part and 10 minutes of my mechanics time Then it was the radiator the air condtioning compressor the fuel pump and some various gaskets Then the alternator belt popped off again leaving me on the side of the road with about 200 in repairs About 6 months after all those repairs the spindle assembly in the front left wheel literally flew off my car while I was driving it I ended up in a ditch quite shaken up but very luckily unharmed I bought a used 1993 Ford Taurus in 1997 with about 50 K miles on it From the beginning this car was a black hole with my hard earned money I spent almost 7000 on this car and have put almost 3000 into it since NOT including gasoline oil changes or regular maintenance First it was the neutral positioning sensor that left me stranded on the side of the highway Then the rack went out along with the power steering pump and the CV joints Another 800 I found out from my mechanic that my car was built on a Friday and that explains a lot I say I wasted a lot of time and money on this hunk of junk and advise anybody out to buy a 1993 or same model Taurus keep looking elsewhere Perhaps I happened to get a bad one out of all of them but I doubt it I wish more than anything I could turn back time and NOT buy a Ford Taurus Buyer beware Now I have a piece of crud that wont even get me 1000 to put towards another car
Neg,So far I have spent over 8 000 in maintenance costs to keep the car going and will probably run another 2 000 if I have the work performed which I doubt This has been the worst car I have ever owned and anyone who is considering purchasing a ford should get smart and look at other alternatives that have a much better maintenance record This is in addition to my August 15th Opinion regarding engine problems which required the replacement of two engines due to head gasket problems I also noted that the transmission was replaced with 32 K miles for 2 000 The Ford company wouldnt not_pay not_for not_the not_replacement not_eventhough not_they not_were not_aware not_of not_a not_front not_piston not_problem not_common not_with not_the not_Taurus not_transmissions not_I not_figured not_that not_with not_a not_new not_transmission not_tires not_engine not_what not_could not_go not_wrong not_I not_found not_out not_today not_59 not_K not_miles not_that not_the not_transmission not_must not_be not_resealed not_due not_to not_numerous not_leaks not_eventhough not_it not_has not_only not_27 not_K not_miles not_on not_it not_It not_will not_cost not_over not_600 not_00 not_Also not_have not_to not_redo not_the not_power not_steering not_also not_due not_to not_leaks not_as not_well not_as not_replacing not_the not_front not_wheel not_bearings
Neg,Dont spend more than 2500 for one unless the trannys been rebuilt or replaced I have owned a couple of these 1993 Ford Tauruses and they are great for roadtrips and long commutes The starters are sketchy and these cars suck when they dont not_work as you begin to realize that no one wants it no matter for how little money if there are electrical or transmission problems The less options the better I hate the transmissions they all go out in the 130k range look for slips and thunks motor mounts are weak too especially on the 3 8s so dont not_mistake the loud thud upon accelerating with tranny problem
Neg,They were all costly But we began to have problems But other then that I love my Taurus It has power everything a good sound system and a sunroof But the rotors and all costed 900 to fix It has a decent engine with good power and has a smooth ride The seats our comfortable with lumbar support and power everything is good We have had problems with both front and rear calibers and the whole brake system So we dont not_use not_it not_seeing not_its not_300 not_dollars not_to not_fix We had to change the rotors the calibers and of course the pads The 3 8 L Fuel Injected v 6 was a poor engine for a Ford product The stereo is great and has good bass and the sunroof is good on warm days The head gaskets broke and air conditioner has stopped blowing cold air but it hasnt been checked We have also had problems with the starter changed once also we have changed the engine once and replaced the motor mounts First of all I love Fords I think they are good cars but the 93 Taurus has caused us some trouble First I bought it about 3 years ago We also have the keyless entry and the code I like the Taurus but with all the problems I would stay away from the 93 94 model and get the 96 99 model But the back brakes were thankfully fixed for free Car X read the paper wrong and another problem that they noticed was when the parking brake is set it hangs up on the wheel
Neg,And finally the drivers side window wont open Then the drivers side mirror fell out onto the street while driving Next a piece of the muffler falls off in my driveway The rear brakes went 6 months after we had them fixed and to top it all off the molding around the windows inside the car is falling off This has happened all in one year and the car was fully inspected by MY mechanic the day we bought it which turned out as an A inspection I just recently bought a used 1993 Ford Taurus Mind you this is the first and ONLY Ford I have ever owned I had the car less than three months when everything started falling apart First the radiator goes and then the water pump So needless to say after 1 406 59 later the car is still developing things wrong or defective not not_to not_mention not_a not_nice not_recall not_on not_some not_of not_the not_cars not_interior not_parts not_which not_I not_have not_to not_have not_fixed not_UGHH not_Can not_we not_say not_HEADACHE not_Never not_will not_I not_buy not_a not_Ford not_again

Neg,The sixteen gallon tank should be enlarged to a twenty gallon tank in my opinion The portion of the rear windshield behind the driver is not not_reached not_by not_the not_wiper By this time you are probably wondering how I wound up with this car From the first day that I drove it there was a problem with the brakes Why is the steering wheel so enormous in the center that you cannot not_see not_the not_instrument not_panel not_when not_you not_make not_a not_turn The fact that the gas gauge takes about 20 minutes to register after the car is filled up took some getting used to as well Why does the cruise control have so many buttons and require two hands to operate I prefer the simple GM system which only requires one hand My next problem is the amount of road noise which gets inside the car I rent many cars each year and this car is definitely above average in the noise department There is a nice thin shelf directly under the radio console I also like the fact that there is a second electronic adapter for electronic devices although this is somewhat standard now This is my company car and it is the only choice that I am given I realize that this next annoyance may only apply to other fleet car drivers but why does My car gets about 18 miles per gallon so with the amount of driving I do I have to stop for gas about twice a week I do not not_think not_that not_a not_larger not_tank not_would not_take not_much not_away not_from not_fuel not_efficiency Other vehicles manage to provide airbags without obstructing the panel view Speaking of obstructions why is the drivers head rest so huge that you cannot not_see not_around not_it not_Is not_it not_me not_or not_is not_the not_road not_clearance not_unusually not_low not_on not_this not_vehicle Whenever I brake the car usually pulls dramatically to the left and sometimes it pulls to the right Like most people I have a busy schedule during business hours and it is not not_convenient not_for not_me not_to not_make not_an not_appointment not_with not_the not_dealer not_to not_have not_this not_fixed not_during not_work not_hours On a recent business excursion it was difficult for passengers in the front seat to hear passengers in the back seat and vice versa due to the road noise Again I realize that this is not not_a not_luxury not_vehicle but I think Ford could do better I would also like to have a larger gas tank There are a number of puzzling aspects about this car For example why isnt not_a not_third not_pull not_out not_seat not_standard not_in not_a not_station not_wagon not_I not_know not_that not_it not_is not_my not_own not_fault not_for not_assuming not_that not_it not_would not_be but now I am stuck with a station wagon with no third seat Also why is the rear windshield wiper not not_centered Perhaps junk is too strong a word to describe my 2000 Ford Taurus Wagon After scanning some of the other Taurus reviews I may be too harsh but I honestly cannot not_recommend not_this not_car not_I not_realize not_that not_this not_is not_not not_a not_high not_priced not_luxury not_car not_so not_I not_guess not_I not_can not_muster not_two not_stars not_considering not_the not_cars not_price not_range not_I not_obtained not_this not_car not_about not_three not_months not_ago not_and not_it not_has not_about not_2500 not_miles Ford throw in a 1000 plus engine upgrade to allow the car to run on ethanol I live on the east coast where ethanol is not not_readily not_available not_I not_am not_sure not_that not_it not_has not_to not_do not_with not_some not_sort not_of not_government not_quota not_but not_I not_would not_have not_much not_rather not_had not_the not_extra not_thousand not_dollars not_put not_into not_something not_usable not_I not_usually not_like not_to not_be not_more not_upbeat not_when not_writing not_reviews not_so not_I not_concentrated not_and not_came not_up not_with not_two not_features not_I not_like not_on not_this not_car
Neg,The first one was a disaster As far as comfort this is an excellent car The major problems ive experienced with both of these cars is electrical problems In 60 000 miles the car went into the shop 14 times for electrical problems The second one is quite minor I currently have 8500 miles on it and the radio clock keeps blinking on and off as you drive I ll have Ford look at it next time it goes in for maintenance I get my Fords for free im an insurance adjustor with a large national insurance company they provide us with a new Taurus when we hit 60 000 miles I think this will give me an unadulterated opinion of the vehicle ive had two so far a 1997 Ford Taurus GL and a 1999 Ford Taurus SE They hold up well in crashes and they do a good job of protecting the passengers Remember one thing though in the purchase of a Ford product Fix Or Repair Daily I used to think that was just a joke however with my experience with the Taurus that is close to true They ranged from interior lights that would not not_ever not_go not_out not_when not_the not_car not_was not_on not_thus not_making not_it not_dangerous not_to not_drive not_at not_night not_I not_had not_to not_pull not_the not_lights not_under not_the not_dashboard not_and not_keep not_the not_dome not_light not_off not_to not_the not_power not_steering not_going not_out not_at not_75 not_mph not_right not_before not_taking not_a not_curve not_on not_the not_interstate not_I not_had not_the not_power not_windows not_go not_out not_the not_power not_locks not_suddenly not_lock not_or not_unlock not_as not_you not_re not_cruising not_down not_the not_street not_the not_alternator not_needed not_a not_change not_and not_I not_went not_through not_three not_computers My office is in my car and the SE package is very nice with electric seats lumbar support and the remote that locks unlocks the door and opens the trunk is a nice touch you dont not_need not_to not_set not_down not_all not_your not_packages or in my case a ladder that fits in the trunk to open the trunk just hold it in your hand and pop it open then set your things right in it As far as safety being in the insurance industry and having the company purchase these cars exclusively for its employees should be testimony enough they have superb safety ratings
Neg,The gas tank is on the passenger side This review will simply explain why I will never own one Thats the only thing I can think of i But I do not not_want not_a not_car not_that not_decides not_for not_me not_when not_the not_doors not_should not_be not_locked i However if you want a detailed review of all the aspects of the Ford Taurus there are plenty of other reviews just click to the next one in the category What is this feature that makes me want to drink gasoline right out of the gas tank Its a common feature on cars today the automatic door locking mechanism This happens nearly every time I get out of the car because I usually travel with my one year old sidekick who likes to ride in his carseat in the back This review is only going to cover the most annoying feature I have ever experienced in a car I will mention that I love the performance and handling of this car Its also very roomy and attractive In order to get him out I have to open the back door Seven times out of ten I have to try to open the back door then curse and re open the driver door hit the unlock button close the driver door and then open the back door At the very least Ford should provide an option for these features some mechanism to turn them on or off as you desire I will never buy a Ford Taurus or any other car with these aggressive features I do not not_want not_my not_car not_telling not_me not_what not_to not_do So lately ive been speaking aloud to this car and it aint Christmas carols im singing when I do Another annoying feature I have discovered is that the car not not_only wants to decide when the doors should be locked but it refuses to shut up about the seat belt The less time that I have to spend dinkering around outside my car messing with locked doors the happier I will be Not to mention the likelihood of me hitting a patch of ice as im scurrying back around to the drivers side to unlock the doors and winding up on my bottom It is my husbands car provided for him by his company so neither of us is responsible for choosing this particular vehicle I have been driving it for a week while he is out of town I will be more than happy to give it back to him when he returns When the car reaches 10 MPH the passenger doors all lock themselves I can see only the slightest faintest benefit to this Maybe it will keep your passengers from getting yanked out of the car and mugged and beaten when you pull up to an urban stoplight next to the whores and winos who decorate the corners of your particular hometown You would not not_believe not_how not_often not_this not_aggravates not_me not_Any not_time not_that not_I not_get not_out not_of not_the not_car not_and not_have not_a not_need not_to not_open not_one not_of not_the not_passenger not_doors not_I not_have not_to not_remember not_the not_extra not_step not_of not_hitting not_the not_unlock not_button not_I not_did not_not not_lock not_the not_door not_why not_should not_I not_have not_to not_remember not_to not_unlock not_it not_i So when im standing over there filling up shivering waiting i ding i the tanks full I put the pump away and grab the door handle to open the passenger side door to get my purse so that I can go pay for my gas Nope Gotta trot my happy butt around the car open the drivers side door hit the unlock button and run back around or crawl in and reach through to grab my purse Keep in mind the average temperature is below zero where I live this time of year It dings every fifteen seconds if I dont not_fasten not_my not_seat not_belt not_Sometimes not_I not_simply not_do not_not not_want not_to not_wear not_it not_okay not_im not_an not_intelligent not_grown not_up not_I not_can not_calculate not_risk not_and not_make not_choices not_for not_my not_own not_personal not_safety not_I not_do not_not not_need not_the not_car not_griping not_at not_me not_about not_it not_This not_has not_only not_forced not_me not_to not_disable not_this not_safety not_feature not_by not_fastening not_the not_seatbelt not_and not_leaving not_it not_fastened not_sitting not_on not_top not_of not_it not_while not_I not_drive not_Instead not_of not_encouraging not_me not_to not_be not_safe not_this not_car not_is not_forcing not_me not_to not_be not_less not_safe not_in not_protest
Neg,This car defines average The bass doesnt thump The interior sound level is rather nice No squeaks or rattles to mention This car also doesnt have the available CD changer The initial visit to the local dealer was interesting It started with an odor of burning oil If that is good or bad you tell me The upholstery is light gray Stone Perhaps medium vanilla gray is the best description To answer you press a button above the rear view mirror There is an extra power port just to the right of the ashtray There are also many decorative little nooks and ledges to gather extra road dust The blower knob no longer sticks where it is supposed to stick It only works to test the bladder once Theres a reason why its one of the most widely used cars for fleets They then drive to a remote location and ask them if they heard the rattle too It also collects stray potato chip crumbs peanut M Ms etc Bins are also built into all the doors While connected the phone charges its battery makes use of the cars external cell phone antenna It eludes a casual reach so ive to stop and fish it out to readjust the blower motor They pulled the service history from their computers and found they had about a dozen recall actions to perform No clue and company policy seems to be to leave the car alone unless its something affecting safety Uh kay The dashboard is laid out fairly well but I think the tachometer was put there to aesthetically balance the speedometer When the CD button is pressed on the stereo the display scrolls NO DJ Bless his heart isnt not_that not_just not_cute not_Whatever The trunk is big enough to swallow most of what I need to carry You can count expansion joints in the road through the seat steering wheel pedals etc Frost heaves are another thing entirely This is also the EVO model engine The center bin is a nice place to keep tapes whatever other little items you need to keep close at hand while driving Not that neat I ll stick to my Jabbra Normally according to the owners manual where the cell phone mounts in this car is another bin It makes occasional lunges for freedom managing to get as far as the floor rolling about as far as the center of the drivers seat You know I didnt not_even not_get not_to not_keep not_the not_old not_rim They d also make quite a mark on the dash if you were to run into something It has quite a range of motion ive a 34 inseam and have never had a desire to move the pedals beyond the hour I first brought this car home The dead pedal is where you d expect it to be if your vehicle is so small as to have the front wheel wells encroach on the passenger cabin If the difference in comfort werent so extreme it wouldnt not_bother not_me not_as not_much My 2000 is also a fleet vehicle ours is the second company it has served HP took delivery of this car first Now dont not_get not_me not_wrong The stereo then cuts off and you hear the conversation over the cars audio system Neat but the little cradle to hold your cell phone is 450 and specific to each brand For some reason it is able to pull radio stations in for some distance further than my GM cars normally have Beyond that it is also rather average for sound How many of you accidentally hit it when your neighbor is checking out your car in the driveway while you re inside the house Can I see some hands It actually tore a hole in it and air was leaking not not_just from the tire bead but also from the rim As mentioned above this vehicle has the adjustable pedals Fine When they blubber incoherently the driver understandably gets mad and Sorry off topic again I also like the key fob remote very nice gadget Press the unlock button once and the drivers door unlocks The side bolsters on the seats are enough to keep you from finding too many alternate pressure points on your gluteus and padding thereof but not not_enough not_to not_keep not_you not_firmly not_centered not_under not_hard not_cornering Those are the kind of things that some members of society put other people in the trunk to check for normally people who owe them large sums of money One occasion that prompted a tire change was when I hit a rather nasty pothole and actually punctured the aluminum rim Not just a bend If your Ferrari has a stiff ride you know its because its a sports car Id much rather have a thermostat but I guess Taurus drivers arent sophisticated enough for that sort of feature HP cars have an option that wasnt not_available not_to not_the not_general not_public or so ive read The car has a switch on the left of the drivers seat that runs a motor that moves the pedal assembly closer or further depending upon your starting point and the direction you push the switch duh But this for me anyway is just too vanilla a car Update 11 Dec 03 Okay folks Twice and all the doors unlock Trunk release is very nice when running out to grab this or that Why do these things occasionally have an EMERGENCY button ive noticed them on Ford Chrysler products key fobs This is a gadget ive no use for Perhaps it was intended for the one million chimps typing randomly on typewriters to get to work long arms and short legs I do like the stereo The store manager is leaning out the window making suggestions Skim the other reviews and see how many of these people actually own one of these cars Fleet managers love this car because it is well rated in crash tests rather reliable and doesnt inspire illegal surges in speed Id have expected it to run better on the alternative fuel but it got the same mileage on the slightly more expensive fuel You can fold the rear seats down to give you more room but it has to be very narrow and short Skis would fit as well as extra long golf clubs I dont not_have not_either That would have been quite a chunk of aluminum to bring in for scrap I could have defrayed the cost a bit eh Oh topic topic It will run happily on environmentally friendly fuels ive only seen one station with a 95 ethanol option and that is about four hours north If your old VW microbus leaks a bit of oil from strange places you accept that as part of the vintage When I went to leave I moved to pull the stalk into the drive position Nothing I tried would work I called my personal mechanic There is a solenoid on the brake pedal that tells the car when the pedal is depressed presumably so it can administer valium The spare is of the doughnut variety and located under the floor of the trunk Normally you dont not_need not_to not_access not_that not_too not_often not_but not_ive not_had not_to not_Twice not_Praise not_the not_Lord not_both not_days not_were not_otherwise not_pleasant not_enough not_that not_it not_wasnt not_a not_huge not_chore However there is a six foot long bolt holding the spare in place Okay perhaps more like six inches I normally dont not_exaggerate not_length but it feels much longer while bent awkwardly into the trunk with demo cases scattered behind me Next time I ll rent a van or luxury car perhaps with a wet bar One interesting feature is the pedal adjustment Ford I believe developed this for those of you who need the seat all the way back to fit behind the steering wheel but then cant not_reach not_the not_pedals Id have driven a used Yugo if the company determined that was what they wanted me to have im grateful that we went to a medium sized car But I do have a few complaints not not_as not_many as Id have if I were forced to drive a used Yugo So it takes 5 minutes to figure out that I will not not_be not_able not_to not_muscle not_this not_into not_drive not_or not_at not_least not_neutral At about 75 000 now the leak started about 20 000 miles ago Oil is leaking from somewhere in the vicinity of the passengers side headlight ive a slick in my garage to show for it No one seems to know what it is that is leaking there An area most manufacturers cut weight now is on the brake rotors Someone at HP either rode the brake a great deal or that pothole also bent the rotor ive a really nasty shimmy shake when braking hard from Interstate speeds Not enough to be dangerous of course but extremely annoying Fuel economy is disappointing Id assume and be incorrect that this medium sized car would get better fuel economy than my land yacht 92 Buick Roadmaster Taurus 23 highway 20 city Roadmaster 25 highway 18 city Id put the car into park as it was taking some time to harvest the potatoes for the fries and kill the chicken to prepare my sandwich yes it took that long The general consensus though is that the back seat is a bit cramped I drove three staff members of a prospective client four hours one way and back again and didnt not_anesthetize not_the not_two not_in not_the not_back not_sufficiently not_Combine not_that not_with not_my not_testosterone not_induced not_marathon not_driving not_style not_and not_I not_really not_dont not_need not_to not_tell not_you not_we not_didnt not_get not_the not_business The center console can be folded up under the center armrest I guess so you can have someone in the front as well as the back sit on the nearly rock solid center and in the front almost on the drivers lap Anyway when this is down you ve two decent cup holders and a place to mount and connect a cell phone In the wait ive discovered the wire has disconnected from the solenoid ive the tow truck driver hold a flashlight while I attempt to reconnect the wire to the solenoid The tow truck drops my car at my mechanics garage he waited for me to get there Fortunately ive a good relationship with my mechanic hes able to squeeze this little project in the next day Thats about all that feature is good for except maybe if someone were to carry 8 boards home from the lumberyard I guess if you need to carry up to four 8 2 x 4 pieces of lumber at a time this would be a good feature Understand that these boards would selfishly hog all your armrest too He added two inches to both wires the second wire was about ready to go as well and now theres a little slack to the wires so they re not not_strained not_to not_the not_limit not_Have not_I not_mentioned not_my not_food not_was not_cold Oh things like the fuel pump pedals too close together windshield wipers alternator a whole range of things I admire Ford for fixing all these things for free but did Microsoft purchase them Perhaps the Taurus it goes through a complete makeover every couple of years uses the summer intern design teams I received the car with around 18 000 miles im not not_certain not_why not_HP not_got not_rid not_of not_it not_so not_early not_but not_ive not_a not_few not_ideas For the 16 000 the company paid for this car I could have bought sorry off topic Handling is also good in the sense that when you turn the wheel to the left the car agrees that is a good direction to go and doesnt fight you in doing it It is good to obey the posted curve speeds as the tires protest too much if speeds are pushed Why this is engineered this way is a mystery but to save thousands of dollars in wire over the manufacturing life of the car the two wires that connect to the pedal are just barely long enough to reach that solenoid when the pedals are set all the way forward to the firewall So the solenoid no longer was connected to the rest of the system that UN locks the transmission stalk I cant not_even not_get not_into not_neutral not_to not_push not_it not_out not_of not_the not_way not_of not_the not_other not_folks not_who not_want not_to not_purchase not_food not_as not_well not_Did not_I not_mention not_that not_it not_was not_5 not_00 not_pm The ride around town is fine Stiff enough to give the impression someone on the cars design team knew someone who was once hooked up with someone who designs sports cars Perhaps with a designer on the Mustang design team Power is decent but not not_inspiring I drive this car up to 3500 miles per month as a salesman for a relatively small company Long drives to various prospects and clients scattered about Iowa are made less comfortable by that stiff suspension But since you need to depress the brake pedal to shift the transmission from park to another selection really not not_a not_bad not_idea and the aforementioned weakness of copper had resulted in an electrical fault that resulted in the car not not_being not_able not_to not_know not_when not_the not_brake not_was not_depressed Incidentally this also handles all the brake lights as well The tire had also had a bad day understand but not not_near as bad as that rim Anyway I was amazed and began to wonder what a replacement might cost 150 200 no 350 Thats 1400 for the set of four I could get a very fancy set on e Bay for okay back to topic The Ford garage admitted that the aluminum rims are rather soft and thats not not_as not_uncommon as I would have thought The paint white of course and exterior finish are well done ive noted earlier models that took a bad primer coat and most of the paint has flaked off the hood and roof of the cars Ford seems to have fixed that issue I guess what this comes down to is that the Taurus has some design and mechanical quirks without the redeeming factors some other cars possess When you push the brake pedal when it is set in that far forward position ive a 34 inseam those wires bend at the solenoid Are you following this Over time copper loses strength when bent back forth back forth Keep that in mind I was purchasing food at a local quick service restaurant sitting in front of their drive up window In a short time I also discover that the wire is a bit short I figure this out by reversing my seating position in the car My feet are up by the ceiling and my arms and head are wedged into the foot well I manage to push the wire into the solenoid and un wedge

within other than items too small to make it worthwhile I have a picture of my wife I in there now Under extreme conditions even the picture slides out Cell phone Forget it Just backing out of the drive way sends it skipping to the floor With two power points I can plug in my phone and my vibrating seat cushion I do like gadgets that work I keep business cards in the ashtray Headroom is very

Neg,My previous care was a 1996 Ford Explorer XLT with 150 000 I have owner a Ford Taurus 24V DOHC Six Seater Option It now has 5000 miles on it and is three months old Overall I love the vehicle Takes time to adjust to cruise final speed 7 Radio reception below par standard audio package 8 Closing the trunk require much force 9 No ceiling handles for passengers Japanese car owners know what I mean 10 Slow pick up for the DOHC V6 24V That truck made me a believer in American cars again and the Ford Taurus is no let down Here are the Ten Best and Ten Worst that I think about my 2000 Ford Taurus Ten Best 1 Excellent Ergonomic Design 2 Great Options i e Six vs Five Seater Free Leather Engine Types 3 Very comfortable ride 4 Low road noise from the inside cabin 5 Unnoticeable gear shifting 6 Low maintenance costs i e 100 000 mile tune up 7 Great highway mileage I get 25 mpg 8 Enormous trunk space 9 Easy to drive 10 Spacious passenger cabin Ten Worst 1 Low city mileage 16 mpg 2 Not much color combination selection interior and exterior combinations 3 Floor mats are ordinary Looks like they got bought in Pep Boys 4 Not very good road handling at high speeds believe me I know 5 Braking is average 6 Cruise control is a little clumsy
Neg,The seats are your typical American car softer and ample sized seats The power drivers seat allows a good driving position to be found The rear seats appear to provide plenty of seating space for three adults including decent leg room The design folks at Ford have obviously realized what an oval all disaster the last generation of Tauruses were But I suppose those who are buying this car are less concerned about this I though that the 1999 model felt more powerful than the 2000 model But if you are looking for just a plain old family car one that has a good safety rating and is decently equipped for around 20 K check out your local Ford dealer My overall impression of the interior was that it had a really sort of modular plastic feel to it There were places where plastic switch plates were placed on top of the plastic door panels rather than having the pieces fit together nicely with a minimal seam But for 20 K I dont not_think not_that not_there not_is not_much not_to not_complain not_about not_Driving not_I not_wasnt not_really not_impressed not_driving not_this not_car not_Sure not_it not_is not_relatively not_quiet not_on not_the not_road not_and not_the not_car not_eats not_up not_imperfections not_in not_the not_road not_but not_it not_is not_just not_not not_a not_FUN not_car not_to not_drive It just doesnt have anything about it that makes me want to buy it But the rental car agencies seem to like them and there are plenty of them on the road so some people must like what Ford has turned out with the Taurus The one interior fixture in the car that I absolutely disliked was the center armrest seat console combination I just believe that there is no such thing as a true three passenger front seating area unless maybe you are driving a 1970 Cadillac Eldorado or something and feel that most car companies do a lousy job at attempting to do so The largest person that could sit comfortably in this space is about a five year old child The storage console is one like those overstuffed sectional couches with fold down cupholders I imagine those who own those type of couches would appreciate this feature in this car Other than that the car is well equipped with power windows and door locks cruise control and a neat control that allows you to adjust the pedals forward and backwards which is good for really short drivers I have had the opportunity to drive several Ford Tauruses through business travel I have driven both the 1999 Ford Taurus SE and the 2000 Ford Taurus SE First off I have to admit that I am not not_a not_Ford not_fan and am not not_in not_the not_market not_for not_a not_sedan not_such not_as not_the not_Taurus But I have to say that the Taurus would be a decent family car for those who would like to get a decently equipped car for around 20 K Exterior The oval shape was everywhere from the headlights the taillights the grill and even the rear window For 2000 the Taurus has moved away from the radical oval design in favor of a some sharper angles which give the car a more elegant look Most importantly the ugly mass of oval rear lights have disappeared being replaced by some simple angular tail lights Interior Gone as well inside the car thankfully is the large oval climate control radio combination Ford still misses the mark by providing a though more attractive single unit climate control radio center The 2000 model seemed a little sluggish with the standard V6 engine I have learned that car manufacturers dont not_offer not_bigger not_engines not_for not_no not_reason not_at not_all not_If not_you not_have not_the not_extra not_cash not_opt not_for not_the not_larger not_V6 not_engine not_Since not_this not_car not_seems not_to not_have not_been not_designed not_with not_a not_more not_comfortable not_ride not_in not_mind not_the not_car not_handles not_with not_a not_bit not_of not_a not_bloated not_feeling not_especially not_on not_freeway not_on not_and not_off not_ramps not_Summary not_I not_personally not_wouldnt not_buy not_this not_car but like I said im not not_in not_the not_market for this type of car And if I was I would rather shell out a few thousand more for the VW Passat Sorry I am a VW fan
Neg,That and a good seat cushion You ll need both The only positive thing was the roomy interior and trunk So I would rather do without so much noise My cousin has an old sleeper sofa with flat worn out cushions And this tank of a car skids on the snow Even with all weather snow tires The heater took forever to heat up and the rear defrost took even longer To help illustrate how uncomfortable it was let me paint a picture When renting a car for the purpose of travel however an American car is most often the only option That was a major disappointment since I sprang for a larger car knowing that I would likely be driving in snowy conditions If after all of this you decide to buy one of these vehicles I wish you all the luck in the world If you love American vehicles beware I personally dont not_care not_for not_them not_I not_find not_Japanese not_and not_German not_automobiles not_to not_have not_better not_service not_records not_more not_style not_and not_an not_overall not_better not_feel not_to not_them To keep people from sinking to the floor when sitting on the sofa she has a piece of ply board between the cushions and you really feel like you are sitting on a piece of thinly padded ply board If you plan on taking a driving vacation and want to bring a lot of people and luggage this is the car for you But keep in mind they will have plenty of elbow and leg room Its just that their butts will be sore numb from the horribly uncomfortable seats So when I traveled to Connecticut for a week I had a choice to rent a Ford Explorer or Taurus I chose the Taurus I wish I had chosen the Explorer I disliked the car from the moment I sat down inside of it The seats were so uncomfortable Thats what the seats in the Taurus felt like I cant not_even not_imagine not_taking not_a not_long not_road not_trip not_in not_this not_car not_let not_me not_know not_when not_you not_plan not_to not_arrive not_and not_I not_ll not_fly not_out not_and not_meet not_you not_I not_also not_felt not_like not_I not_was not_sitting not_too not_high not_up not_for not_a not_sedan not_and not_no not_matter not_how not_much not_adjusting not_I not_did not_to not_the not_seat not_I not_just not_couldnt not_get not_comfortable The ignition was hidden so far under the steering wheel that it required me to do a deep side stretch just to start the car And the console controls i e radio A C defrost etc are so far away from the driver that unless you have the wingspan of an albatross some major leaning is involved just to find a good song on the radio Speaking of the radio I had to turn it up really loud to drown out the loud interior noise Acceleration sounded like the takeoff in an airplane Now if someone would serve me a light snack and a beverage of my choice while driving to the grocery store I wouldnt not_mind not_it not_so not_much but they dont
Neg,The steering was great There was too much wind engine and tire noise Also the steering wheel on the Taurus is ugly Seats You might pay a little more if you want the same options but its worth it in the long run not not_to not_mention not_resale not_value But if you are looking for a car with some character and even a mildly engaging driving experience you are better off in something else The seats were flat and uncomfortable I did have the bench seat up front and so I would hope that a model with bucket seats would be better Although the design was ergonomic enough the dash had too much hard plastic and the switchgear felt like it came from an econobox I think my Focus has a better quality interior The radio reception was terrible and the speakers were the kind you would buy off the sale rack at Walmart A Taurus has the stigma of being rental and a loaner car The car had that fake leather on the seats that looks nice for about 10 000 miles then starts to look like the plastic you would find the the backseat of a cab Noise For a car that Ford claims was designed in a wind tunnel there is way too much wind noise coming off the side mirrors I suspect the door seams are sub par It was bigger than most if not not_all of the cars in its class such as a Accord or Camry im over 6 feet tall and I had plenty of room up front and so did people in the back even with my seat all the way back I had a Red 2000 Taurus SES as a loaner car for almost 2 weeks I put almost 1000 miles on it in a combination of city driving and long trips Overall I was mostly disappointed with Fords family sedan but it did have some good points I should mention Pros It has no personality whatsoever nor does it have the quality and reliability you would find in a Toyota Honda Mazda or even a Nissan or a Mitsubishi Dont get me wrong I am sure there are tens of thousands of Taurus owners who love their cars and are perfectly happy with them The only car in this class that has as much room is the Chevy Impala which is an incredibly ugly car by the way The trunk was very large and easily held luggage for 4 Compared to other rental cars I have had such as a Mazda 626 the Taurus was much better for long trips The engine did not not_sound not_nearly not_as not_refined not_as not_you not_would not_hear not_in not_a not_V6 not_Accord not_or not_Camry not_and not_when not_you not_put not_your not_foot not_down not_it not_sounded not_like not_it not_was not_going not_to not_crash not_through not_the not_firewall not_and not_end not_up not_in not_your not_lap not_The not_Taurus not_I not_drove not_had not_the not_upgraded not_engine not_and not_I not_would not_hate not_to not_think not_what not_an not_owner not_of not_a not_base not_model not_would not_have not_to not_put not_up not_with not_on not_a not_daily not_basis not_Radio It was the perfect balance of being communicative yet comfortable Not as sporty as a Focus or a Mustang but certainly not not_a not_boat on wheels like a Crown Victoria or an Impala Didnt attract attention I have been known to exceed the speed limit once in a great while and I think a Ford Taurus is just about as anonymous as you can get in terms of attention from the Police OK now for the things I didnt not_like not_Interior not_materials
Neg,The worst mistake they ever did By the way they no longer have it The warranty is there as a convienence to the customer and the dealers The dealers can and will set up vehicles to last just long enough Something as simple as a oxygen sensor will in most cases be overlooked or simply pulled cleaned and reinstalled along with other things Buying a Ford Taurus from a used car dealer can be a good thing it can also be your worst nightmare Buying a 1994 vehicle like the Ford Taurus that was purchased with 80 000 miles attached to it by 1997 my first question would have been whether or not not_these not_miles not_where not_highway not_or not_city not_or not_a not_combo not_im not_going not_to not_bet not_you not_the not_dealer not_lied not_Keep not_in not_mind not_that not_most not_used not_car not_dealerships not_buy not_their not_cars not_from not_auctions not_at not_a not_reasonably not_lower not_cost not_than not_anyone not_will not_purchase not_them Yes it does have room to breathe and the seats are comfortable but room and comfort wont get you where you want to go Be careful to find the best dealers look for bad and good track records watch out for the quick sell A vehicle that wont go over 65 mph without dying on you would not not_be not_in not_my not_driveway not_I not_totally not_agree not_with not_anyone not_who not_hates not_their not_Ford not_Taurus not_A not_friend not_of not_ours not_had not_one not_it not_lasted not_one not_year not_Yes not_they not_put not_more not_money not_into not_this not_car not_then not_what not_it not_was not_worth

Neg,They are terrible cars dont not_buy not_them Who in the right mind would buy this piece of JUNK I have always hated Fords except for the Explorer which is an amazing car but I absolutely hate the Taurus so much It is a waste of room on the Highway and it baffles me why people buy this car it always falling apart like a typical Ford sedan does No I really hate this car it has no positive feature to it and to top it off it is one of the number one selling cars in the country believe it or not not_I dont not_believe not_it not_but not_its not_actually not_true not_I not_HATE not_FORDS not_i not_hate not_them not_so not_much
Neg,There was no dead animal ladder or D O T worker lying in my wake To say they were less than kind would be an understatement The new Taurus is a louder ride with stiffer seats and in my case a very unsatisfactory transmission and thats NO BULL The mortally wounded bull was towed to a dealership other than the one where it was born The surrogate dealership was NOT excited to see the tag of the other dealer still on the back of the vehicle My car was rapidly losing speed and I turned on the emergency flashers as I made my way to the side of the road The made it clear up front they would get right to work in three or four days if they had time I got my new blue Y2K Taurus only 10 short days ago My previous vehicle was a red 98 Taurus with which I was delighted Now I am NOT delighted There was sudden apparence that my NEW 10 DAY OLD Taurus had decided to chew its transmission into powder and refuse to move Ford roadside assistance was very nice and the tow truck arrived after dark While traveling at the speed limit of 70mph on the interstate in my new vehicle cruise control on for ticket prevention I felt a strong JOLT and looked in my rear view mirror because I thought I must have run over something
Neg,The back seats fold down VERY easily The seats are comfortable and adjust well but are nothing great This thing seems to suck down the gas faster than either my Jag or 4 Runner You have to hit the unlock button 2 or 3 times to trigger all the doors to unlock One annoying thing about the car is that the power locks only automatically unlock the front drivers door via the factory remote This provides plenty of room for me to lie my bike in without having to remove the wheels So if you are driving park it and turn off the car when you step out of the driver door all other doors stay locked Some people may like this but it really annoys me As for fuel economy NOT The car I was given is a very nice shade of blue and as far as wagons are concerned the shape is nice Driving the car is easy and it handles fairly well Overall it is a fair car Nothing great but not not_bad either I recently was given a Ford Taurus to drive as my company car until my official car comes in look for my review of that car when it comes in either a Grand Marquis a Ford Crown Vic or a Mercury Sable LS Anyway I have been driving this for about a month Its an OK car but I wouldnt not_buy not_it not_The not_interior not_is not_nice not_enough but it is already beginning to show wear
Neg,While the car feels solid at least the doors This car while not not_bad isnt not_up not_to not_the not_competition The trunk is not not_small not_however not_it not_is not_a not_tad not_shallow The body panelling just has a thin look to it maybe from cheaper than average paint The front lights looked utterly bug like and the dashboard was so revolutionary it was confusing The front seats are comfy and the footrest is placed just about right for my length of feet and legs At least it doesnt shift very much on highway driving and it rarely hunts on winding hilly country roads The rear seats are more cramped than other cars in its class and they could be less angled at least in my opinion Kinda Like the Girl in Pretty Woman Good Looking but pretty darn unrefined Face it the old Ford Taurus was butt ugly The wheel might have been designed for those with smaller hands in mind but it works for the bigger handed among us too The pillars behind the rear seat are kinda wide so backing up is a slight chore if you have to look to the side for kids for example The new Taurus remedies some of the problems of the old one as the dashboard is pretty straghtforward and the body while not not_a not_knockout is far better looking than the old one My hands felt closer together than normal on this steering wheel and while it did nothing to detract from driving it it was disconcerting at first When I first got behind the wheel of the Taurus the steering wheel struck me as a little odd its smaller than the average steering wheel by maybe about two inches in diameter The car does not not_seem not_underpowered but one would not not_get not_that not_impression not_by not_listening not_to not_the not_transmission not_which not_is not_loud not_rough not_and not_shifts not_very not_loudly not_especially not_when not_starting not_up not_from not_a not_red not_light When you floor the gas pedal the transmission will suddenly shift down to first or second and it makes the entire front of the car very very loud as it reaches and passes the 3000 RPM mark Fortunately this only lasts a few seconds however regular shifting is also quite loud The Camry is a much smoother driver as is the Accord However if you are a die hard American car owner than this is probably the car for you whil it might not not_match not_the not_import not_competition not_this not_car not_is not_in not_many not_ways not_still not_far not_better not_than not_its not_Chevy not_and not_Buick not_competition And while the dash is far less cluttered than before one has to think about the designers who thought that rubber plastic looks good and the little TV style volume markers on the LCD display I mean if it sounds loud enough for you who cares about the little markers These brakes dont not_kick not_in not_until not_the not_pedal not_is not_most not_of not_the not_way not_down not_and not_the not_brakes not_gradually not_get not_stronger not_so not_that not_they not_are not_grabby not_only not_at not_the not_end not_of not_the not_pedal not_stroke not_and not_even not_to not_just not_slow not_the not_car not_down not_the not_pedal not_should not_be not_pushed not_nearly not_all not_the not_way not_to not_the not_bottom not_of not_the not_stroke not_The not_Verdict Also the brake light hump is incredibly large and it not not_only takes up a lot of space in the rear view mirror but it also covers up a lot of the trunk area so that it is hard to see the edge f the trunk when you look through the rearview mirror so it is difficult to judge the length of the rear of the car Another unrefined part of this car would be the brakes

Neg,Wheel bearings This vehicle was a nightmare Wheel mount Struts Fuel pump Brake rotors and pads They have also worked on the drivers side window mechanism and the engine So far now at 5300 miles the following has had to be replaced My wife and I bought this car in June and it is falling apart The car still makes the rotational grinding noise and popping when in a turn or over a bump We bought this to replace an older car so we would spend less time in the service department but look what happened Save your time and money and purchase any car that is not not_made not_here not_in not_the not_US not_Our not_quality not_of not_workmanship is horrible in US factories Caveat Emptor
Neg,It turns out there was a recall on the subframe connectors or mounts The transmission blew at 105 000 in the middle of Virginia In the meantime my brother and I had to hitch a ride back to the NY Not much fun He hit a pothole and discovered that the engine suddenly fell on to ground ive never heard of such a thing It really did happen Being already out of warranty we went to a local Ford dealer to see if this is normal Of all the monstrosities of owning an unreliable vehicle as my brother was driving it one day he noticed that the steering locked while in motion They fixed it for free minus a Metallica CD one of the mechanics decides to steal from the back seat I couldnt prove it After a while the Taurus developed this engine surge at all rests either at a light or stop sign with the brake pedal applied It was unexplainable to a mechanic so we tried to live with it Eventually the surges would increase in intensity and eventually stall the motor Its eventual demise came when I took a road trip to Florida from NY On my way back to NY it decided to finally die I would have to agree that the ownership of the Ford Taurus was not not_much not_fun not_I not_had not_one not_for not_a not_few not_years not_and not_rarely not_drove not_it not_Yes not_it not_was not_a not_comfortable not_car not_but not_it not_had not_so not_much not_problems not_I not_ll not_tell not_you not_what not_kinds not_of not_headaches not_this not_car not_has not_caused not_Until not_its not_ultimate not_death not_at not_just not_a not_little not_over not_100 not_000 not_miles not_ive not_had not_the not_front not_brake not_rotors not_replaced not_twice not_an not_engine not_that not_overheated not_3 not_times not_electrical not_shortages not_a not_whining not_and not_moaning not_steering not_rack not_and not_the not_unbelievable not_the not_subframe not_on not_which not_the not_engine not_is not_assembled not_fell not_to not_the not_ground
Neg,They even have a site with a lawyer suing the company There are many many people like me Now I am faced with another 1 700 to fix the head gasket valve and engine mounts I want another car but can only spend 8 000 for a used car Dont talk yourself into a car before you do your homework and be practical about the car I purchased an 89 Ford Taurus new because I fell for the hype Best selling car in American THAT DOESnt MEAN A THING except a lot of people were deceived by the numbers ive had expensive repairs all along and visited web sites that say Ford knew of the bad transmission just spent 3 000 for a rebuilt one 6 months ago when they were building the car
Neg,Wheels The front and back seats are all extremely comfortable We like the looks the comfort and every other aspect What does the dealership do about these problems FIL The torque converter in the

question and answer form DnDn4kidz It takes a barnyard to turn it around in because its a huge truck but you have to expect needing a lot of area to turn such a large vehicle in DnDn4kidz The law in

FIL from here on out We bought the Ford because it was the only truck that met all the specifications we were looking for including full size rear doors Where do you want to start Hehe Within the first 1000 miles we drove this truck the transmission and the after cooler on the turbo failed Within the first 15 000 miles the steering box and the brakes failed losing complete control of the truck The dealership in Utah where the truck was purchased continues to fix the problems within a timely manner but the problems continue to occur But for 43 000 you would expect to be purchasing a vehicle

There is plenty of leg room for short or tall passengers and plenty of head room DnDn4kidz Aside from the constant worry of something breaking how is driving this truck Could someone such as myself

not_one they got stuck with The recommend to potential buyers is a yes and no response
Neg,The styling yeesh Very little wind noise The power steering is easy and quiet im a commercial Industrial HVAC service tech In case theres any doubt The silver exterior paint clear coat finish is excellent The suspension on this van is completely useless The high back reclining bucket seats are very comfortable and durable The 4 speed electronic overdrive transmission has not not_been not_the not_greatest Now for the bad We ll start off with the minor stuff The engine in my 96 E 250 is a 351 V8 not not_the not_Triton This expensive solution eliminated the hard pulling and dog tracking while greatly improving tire life Yes the parking brakes should have held the VAN Now for the big disappointment Had several trips to the Ford dealer and they never did find the problem It still handles like a pig and the ride is a little rougher though Applying new paint doesnt help much as it eventually wears off in a few months Now I just keep it clean and waxed otherwise rust begins to appear Having that little extra weight on the drivers side causes the van to pull hard to the right The heater is great even on the coldest days and the air conditioner does a really good job on the hottest days To get the windshield washer to activate I have to hit the stalk hard several times The increased weight in the rear causes the front end to lift up which throws the geometry way off If you sent this van back to 1976 it would fit right in and wouldnt not_turn not_a not_single not_head not_Dash not_controls not_are not_cheap This has happened on both the drivers and passenger sides Dome lights dont not_turn not_on not_when not_side not_and not_rear not_doors not_are not_open This van cannot not_handle not_an not_average not_load not_let not_alone not_an not_unequal not_load not_Loaded not_down not_with not_test not_equipment not_tools not_and not_parts not_the not_van not_handles not_like not_a not_PIG Then the van is sent to a frame and suspension shop where the front end is aligned with special cams while the cargo area has its usual load There is more storage space on the drivers side than the passenger side due to the two side doors so of course there will be more weight on the drivers side With the cargo area empty it drives fine Load it up and watch out As I said before I have the dealer installed shelves and cabinets To try and solve these problems every van at the company was equipped with Air Lift bags Each bag has an individual air line so that the back can be leveled off perfectly In nearly 6 years 70 000 miles this van has NEVER failed to start on the first turn of the key whether its 10 degrees below 0 or 110 degrees in the shade So far no repairs other than regular maintenance have been done to the engine Gas mileage is excellent for this big loaded down van and with the large fuel tank I can go several days between fill ups This engine provides plenty of power in all situations Acceleration is excellent and I have no problem burying the 85 mph speedometer I would estimate top speed is around 100 mph The 4 speaker stereo sounds sweet All accessory controls are clearly marked and easy to get at The dash layout is great Speedometer trip meter fuel gauge are all easy to see Theres also temperature oil pressure and volt gauges The engine provides enough power so that the transmission never has to hunt between 3rd gear and 4th overdrive something that plagued my previous 88 E 150 I have however had problems with it sticking in 1st gear on hot days The plastic end of the gear select column where the overdrive button is was always flimsy and the stalk eventually broke off revealing wires and a small circuit board also happened to one of our newer vans Epoxy took care of that problem The company I work for has quite a few Ford E 250 vans ranging from 1994 to 2001 ive driven all including the 98s however my personal company vehicle is a 96 All vans are nearly identical First I ll start out with the good points Id like to mention these vans are NOT even close to be OVERLOADED I personally think Ford designed these vans more like trucks trying to give them a car like ride when empty Unlike a truck a service van is a garage office on wheels and always loaded down The cup holder wore out quickly and the single thin plastic tab that actually supports your drink broke off for me today sending my bottle of Sobe into the storage compartment under it The doors fit nicely however the weather stripping on the bottom rubs the center of the rocker panel enough so that a 1 section of paint wore off The van stays outside year round and goes into many hostile environments such as steal mills and construction sites yet after a quick wash looks new Cargo capacity is good I have the dealer installed shelves and cabinets and theres still plenty of floor space for big equipment I also believe the height of the cargo area is better than most other makes If you follow behind the van you can literally see it dog tracking down the road Needless say front tire life is pathetic at best 12 K to 15 K miles before the insides are worn to the threads and cupped Rears wear even but suffer from cupping too Lower ball joints completely gave away at 52 K miles Ford had some kind of good will warranty on these but wouldnt not_honor not_it not_past not_50 not_K not_miles Also the Parking Pawl inside the transmission broke while parked on a steep driveway as I was pulling equipment out from the back doors of the van Luckily I had the parking brake on which slowed it down enough for me to get out of the way and then chase it down and hop inside before it made it to the street Van had 6 K miles at the time Dealer repaired the transmission and parking brake under warranty
Neg,So to the prospective buyers of this van make sure you check that feature and ask for it when you buy it I own a Ford Econoline E150 1998 model conversion van I like the quality of the van as well as all the convenient features such as cruise cassette air ABS etc So there is absolute no warning if one of the doors is not not_shut not_tight not_I not_can not_not not_believe not_the not_van not_with not_all not_the not_standard not_features not_does not_not not_have not_this not_important not_and not_basic not_feature However I was surprise to discover after I purchased the van that one safety feature is missing That is the Door Ajar warning is not not_included not_as not_standard
Neg,Her head is just about touching the top And when I say NO HEADROOM I mean that my 7 year old fits the seat just perfectly The first complaint I had was the back bench Theres just no headroom The vehicle actually cut off a few times for no apparent reason 3 My ABS light would go on and off We wanted a car that seated more than just 5 because we have children and the older ones are getting BIG When we purchased this vehicle what sold me was the way that it handled I was afraid it was going to be like driving a bus but it handles like a car We are very good with preventative maintenance but after a year of regular driving we started to experience problems with the vehicle 1 When we were idle the car would rumble and sound like it was going to cut off 2 We took the truck to the Ford dealership several times before the warranty ran out throughout the first three years but they never found anything wrong Now that the warranty has run out three years after purchasing a brand new vehicle the truck runs like an old used chevy truck Its not not_bad but I expect better quality reliability and service
Neg,No sound not not_even not_a not_click The color was bright neon green When you turned the key nothing happened The 1994 Ford Escort seemed to fit the bill perfectly The battery was replaced and all was well again The car I picked off the lot was a four door model When I came back out again it simply would not not_start At about 15 000 miles from under the hood came a loud annoying chirping noise When I pulled of the car lot with it I was a happy camper As it turned out the fan belt was frayed and needed to be replaced It did not not_include not_many not_options but it did include air conditioning cassette player and power mirrors The correct name of that specific color was Calypso Green Such a color really appealed to my teenage self at the time My brand new car was towed back to the dealership and was discovered to have a dead cell in the battery In December of 1994 I was 16 years old I was a newly licensed driver and was looking for a car that was economical reliable and most importantly safe One day about six months later the trouble began I had been driving the car all day and it had been running fine I stopped at a store for a few minutes The car is in pretty good running condition now and I hope all of the kinks have been worked out Currently the speedometer cable makes an extremely annoying chirping noise at low to moderate speeds and the temperature gauge does not not_work If I could go back in time knowing what I know now I would not not_have not_bought not_this not_car not_I not_can not_only not_hope not_that not_others not_have not_had not_a not_better not_experience not_than not_I not_have It was found to be odd that the belt had gone bad at such low mileage Upon further investigation the pulley that operates the fan belt was found to be defective Both the pulley and the belt were replaced A few months later at about 20 000 miles the car would not not_start not_again not_Once not_again not_it not_took not_a not_ride not_on not_the not_tow not_truck not_to not_the not_dealer and was found to have a defective ignition module Luckily the warranty was still in effect because that would have been the most costly repair of all about 500 600
Neg,What do I love Once the ignition was replaced the electrical problems ceased We only bought another one because it was cheap and the dealership is close by The guy who recently worked on it said you must really love this car Bought this car new in 1994 at night in a snowstorm I thought I was getting a champagne colored vehicle But when I picked it up it was a horrible pinkish bronze color Has to be the ugliest color Ford ever used The fan rotor burned out three times before the dimwit mechanics at my dealership finally figured out that it was a faulty ignition which never really shut off So if you think your car is possessed have the ignition checked I wouldnt not_buy not_another not_one not_just not_because not_im not_ready not_to not_move not_on not_Our not_first not_Escort not_81 not_was not_a not_fiasco It was cheap Its got 70 on it and still runs pretty well ive recently had to replace broken springs struts brakes rotors and the exhaust system but until now other than an electrical problem below it has only needed oil gas and tires To be honest if I could afford it right now Id give it to the kids and get something nicer and which had a quieter ride Early on I had a lot of trouble with the cooling fan rotor burning out Then the radio would come on when the car was shut off
Neg,Sheesh Yes twice Same bloody mess The interior is intuitive This thing is dangerous On second thought can I ride in your trunk It ll be much safer for me back there This stuff should be outlawed Anyone know who invented this thing Thanks for offering me a ride but I ll take the bus instead And then you re supposed to buckle up the lap part of the seat belt yourself So naturally I get into this car close the door and immediately reach for the seat belts Whoah Now the most annoying thing about this car is the automatic seat belts I never understood this stupid invention It reminded me a lot of my dads old 1991 Ford Taurus especially the sloped front and the sloped headlights The car felt solid though and I didnt not_feel not_unsafe not_in not_it not_at not_all not_except not_read not_below The gauges and controls are where they belong Nothing annoyed me which is a good thing The drive was what I expected not not_spectacular not_but not_enough power to not not_get not_blown not_away not_on not_the not_freeways Always even if im just backing out of my garage 15 feet to wash my car yes im that anal So as you can figure if a car has automatic seat belts I get no where NEAR that car When you close your door the part that is attached to the door frame slides back to the pillar next to your seat The inventor needs to have his her patent revoked and be subject to having his her fingers caught in the rails of the belts AT LEAST two times It works like this The across your chest part of the seat belt is actually buckled by default and when your get in the car it stretches between you and the steering wheel In fact its like a mini me version of the Ford Taurus Visibility is great all around and I sat high enough on this car to be able to see everything around me The belt isnt not_back not_there not_Oh not_no not_Here not_comes not_the not_belt not_Sliding not_into not_position not_like not_a not_roller not_coaster not_out not_of not_control not_Bam not_My not_fingers not_are not_caught not_on not_the not_rails not_as not_the not_belts not_slide not_into not_the not_pillar not_OOOOOOOOOOOuch This is definitely a great point A to point kind of car with great fuel economy I think I got a few days of driving off a quarter tank of gas and I drove a lot too It was the cheapest car they had for rent and I didnt not_have not_much not_choice not_as not_only not_one not_rental not_place not_accepted not_drivers not_under not_21 not_years not_old not_to not_rent not_their not_cars not_the not_surcharge not_and not_insurance not_are not_ridiculous not_First not_the not_car not_looks not_okay The seats were a bit too firm but then I didnt not_buy not_this not_car and had to live with it I had the 2 door model and I loaded a lot of stuff in that car I was impressed by the space in this subcompact car Another point if you happen to get in the car close the door and realize that it wasnt not_shut not_tight and then you open the door and close it again the seat belts slide back and forth and back upon every door movement you just made A few years ago while I was doing an internship in Los Angeles moving from place to place generous volunteers who d put us up for a few weeks each I rented a white Ford Escort to load all my stuff and drive to a few places Uh my car attacked me And you know whats sad I did it again a few days later even after spending a good meditative chanting session telling myself that I will wait two seconds for the belt to do its thing before moving any part of my body The stereo cassette player was pretty terrible I had the windows rolled down on the freeway and listening to the radio at almost full blast and the distortion was awful to listen to I could have rolled up the windows its L A smog central after all but I like driving with the windows down Now did you catch the stupidity of that concept Let me explain if you re making automatic seat belts the stuff should automatically buckle itself up with no help from you Instead its half automatic you have to buckle the lap belt yourself otherwise you re not not_doing not_yourself not_any not_good not_its not_like not_not not_wearing not_belts not_because not_you not_say not_your not_car not_has not_airbags But the real gripe I have about this concept is that I am an injured victim of such brilliant invention who lives now to tell you about it albeit with some permanent war scars to show for it You see the first thing I do when I get into a car without any nanosecond of thought is to put on my seat belts It takes a good second or two to realize what just happened and then a loud scream and other profanities lurching outward from my mouth and then I realize that ive been attacked by the seat belts I quickly open the door and the thing backs off taking a good chunk of ectoderm skin with it im bleeding A lot Blood everywhere Not as bad as the brains in the movie Pulp Fiction but pretty bad Now how do I explain this bloody shirt to my boss
Neg,If you are in the market for a work truck The 2002 XLT Ford Ranger truck is very masculine and handsome despite its small package The exterior looks pretty much like it has since 1997 The base engine is a 135 horsepower DOHC 4 cylinder available in the XL models All engines are either matched with a 5 speed manual or a 4 speed automatic There is plenty of room in the front and rear for small adults The 3 0 is available in the XLT XLT 4 wheel drive the Edge 4 wheel drive This is just an optional engine that will set you back around 800 extra dollars The top of the list is a 4 0 liter engine which produces an impressive 207 horsepower When the key was turned the OHV 3 0 liter engine came to life without hesitation The next engine up is a 150 HP powered 3 0 OHV V6 engine the one in my test truck You may want to check out a href content 53380157060 my review on the 2002 Ford F 150 a Happy Car Shopping The interior is not not_Lexus not_material but then again this isnt not_a not_Lexus nor is is made to be even close Id go with a Tacoma or a full sized Ford F 150 which offer an even more impressive package Looking for a slightly larger truck The interior of the XLT 4 wheel drive came with excellent ergonomics driver and passenger airbags 60 40 split bench a tachometer very supportive and comfortable seats The price for an XLT 4x4 is around 20 000 fairly loaded With every amenity available The XLT can run for nearly 23 000 There is a XLT FX 4 package available that will give this truck a more rugged appearance huge tires and Bliston shocks are also added There is a new grille for the 2002 model year The Ranger seems to get a different styled grille every other year or so to keep the style fresh At low Speeds the 3 0 has enough torque 185 lb ft for quick low speed acceleration but entering the freeway and trying to get up to 70 mph is a whole different story Handling is good enough not sports car material of course but I was surprised that I could keep up with small cars while driving through the Avenue of the Giants The test truck was an XLT 4x4 3 0 liter automatic Dressed in black clear coat metallic with tan cloth interior i Driving Impressions i Entering the vehicle was easy enough test truck had a lift kit and very large meaty tires but there was no problem getting my fanny into the seat The XLT 4x4 3 0 can tow up to 3 800lbs I have taken other years of the Ford Ranger off road and it does fairly well not not_as not_well not_as not_the not_Toyota not_Tacoma not_which not_seems not_to not_have not_a not_better not_4x4 not_system however is adequate accomplishing off road tasks i Interior Accommodation i There was a very clear sounding Ford produced stereo system Power everything a factory installed alarm and many other options that can be had depending oh how large your wallet is Ford com has all the info you could need on optional and standard equipment i Exterior Innovation i A fter the Ranger was transformed from a large midsized truck in the 60s and 70s to a relatively small truck in the early 80s its been on one of the best selling trucks in its class Good price good looks and a wide array of engines have contributed to the current Rangers success Engine For 2002 there is not not_too not_much not_new not_in not_the not_drivetrain not_department This truck equipped with the OHV 3 0 and a 4 speed automatic begs to be driven slow Hills are this trucks worst enemy With cruise control set 70 MPH this Ranger would down shift into 3rd with even the slightest incline Engine noise was louder than expected and at 70 MPH this truck cruised at a little over 3 000 RPM The 3 0 OHV is a proven engine it has been in cars and trucks since 1986 so reliability is probably good but I cant not_comment not_personally not_on not_this not_particular not_model not_year not_WWW not_CONSUMER not_REPORTS not_ORG not_has not_more not_info not_i not_Conclusion not_i not_The not_2002 not_Ford not_Ranger not_represents not_an not_excellent not_value not_however not_the not_more not_competent not_competition not_offered not_from not_Toyota not_makes not_this not_truck not_less not_desirable
Neg,It truly gets about 16 18 mpg rd hwy The maneuverability and size convenience is there and I lowered my car payment easy to park and move around on the smaller streets If you go to the message boards on Edmunds com you can see this is a repetitive problem with the Rangers The reason for my dissatisfaction with Ford is a result of a mechanical problem with my truck that has not not_been not_repaired The trucks condition is below the reasonable expectations of a new owner ALWAYS TEST DRIVE FOR AT LEAST 15 20 minutes on various road conditions even with a new car If you go with this truck make sure it has power windows because its hard to drive and roll up the window at the same time If you do end up getting a Lemon Ford will tell you to eat it To see more problems with Ford search the internet with the words Ford Secret Warranties In short the truck has an extremely rough sporadic shake in idle I returned to the dealership with the Ranger the day after I purchased it and I spoke with the service manager The engine power I feel if fair I have a 3 0L I can make it up a hill without downshifting most of the time however it does not not_accelerate not_well not_uphill So I did I get a call from the Ford Regional office in Los Angeles and they said they are reviewing their records and that they have determined that Peyton Cramer Ford could not not_replicate not_the not_problem not_with not_my not_Ford not_Ranger and that it is a normal working condition of the truck I am writing this because of a difficult experience I am having with the Ford Ranger pickup truck I recently purchased from Peyton Cramer Ford in Torrance California After this involvement with Ford I will never buy from or recommend Ford Motor Company for the duration of my car buying days Also make sure you get the Supercab with the four doors it makes all the difference in getting in and out of the back seat However if you have kids or carry people around in your backseat frequently I dont

of the truck shaking Both have stated and recommended that there is problem with the truck and to take it back to the dealership where it was originally purchased I am completely dissatisfied with my Ranger not not_only because of its mechanical problem but also because of the great inconvenience and frustration I have suffered due to Fords lack of responsibility He acknowledged the problem and

Neg,The Transmission is rather good thankfully No this car isnt not_mine not_Its not_my not_fathers It seems sound enough all on its own Oh well Its not not_really not_noticeable not_but not_its not_annoying The shifter is located between the center consol and drink holders We replaced the regular stereo and put a CD player there instead The Beginning I thought the poor 1992 Ford Taurus could use a good review The floor matts are original and hold well on the clean fuzzy floor too The lights themselves turn on and off automatically depending on the light level So much more than anything else ive owned really to that point Though after 120K miles it is a bit weaker than Id like The cup holders opposite it on the front click in and out and are sturdy enough The four speed has overdrive features as well and ive never experienced a problem here It will also tell you the temperature outside with the click of a button And furthermore it was chosen before for comfort something the Dodge Aires lacked The drivers steering wheel contains an airbag and theres another for the front passenger as well as an option The sound system was mediocre even if it was Ford Premium Sound as was claimed When I borrowed it Utoh I was used to driving my underpowered Chrysler LeBaron It broke again They break easily and a few no longer glow green instead showing the white light below He fixed it again It broke again That worked So he put it in on new mounts Unfortunately the light died in there and one cant not_see not_if not_one not_is not_in not_park not_or not_drive not_at not_night Theres a wiper for the back window as well which can independently be turned on and off Quite useful And thats true with this one Though unfortunately I dont not_imagine not_many not_people not_will not_be not_calling not_this not_car not_good not_in not_the not_end not_through not_my not_experience We thought when we got this car that everything was basically new and fixed and in working order He fixed it with an expensive kit again So he sold the Aires and got the Taurus hoping for a better ride more power more comfort more cargo space and more features The stereo though worked well enough However all the buttons are flimsy plastic all the way up the front not not_only on the stereo but the climate control as well The car got four stars for driver and five stars for passenger crash test ratings http www nhtsa dot gov NCAP SList cfm vehyear 1992 vehmake Ford vehmodel Taurus To fix an electrical problem on a Ford or get any information from the computer the process is much more complex involving electro voltage meter things And it ran well after a bit of adjusting However another problem occurred promptly after The engine is unbalanced enough for the hose to shake and break off each time The dash is vinyl all along and if taken care of wont split Unfortunately ours did when we forgot to keep it all shiny and nice The hose for the power steering broke partially So Dad fixed it It broke again The high beams can be turned on by pulling back the windshield wiper stick which unfortunately also can be a pest if the wipers go on by accident It really wasnt not_worth not_it not_overall not_to not_fix not_it not_so not_many not_times And thusly had a very heavy foot I ripped the engine off its mounts in driving to college and made it stall several times The windshield wipers come on strong and do a very good job of keeping everything clear during a storm though there have been electrical problems with them See the next section But otherwise it works well and I can easily go by feel Its stiffer than most and the handle is a firm rubber which is easy to grip There have been a lot of problems with it though see the next section for that The interior is spacious with 1003 cubic inches or 83 5 cubic feet for passengers He fixed it temporarily it broke again as expected but by that time the super duty kit came One needs to turn them on and off after that to get them to go again He got it to replace the 1986 Dodge Aires he got to replace the Ford Tempo even before the poor Tempo Burst into Flames See my review on that for an even worse horror story Of course I didnt not_really not_own not_it not_Dad not_did but I drove it an awful lot The Six Cylinder 3 8 Liter engine is in actuality a Ford Eight Cylinder engine with the last two cylinders chopped off They dont not_always not_stop not_at not_the not_bottom not_when not_turned not_off not_and not_often not_stop not_all not_together not_when not_running not_Very not_dangerous As nice of a car as it is its problems would prevent us from ever considering it again That much he got but he got a lot more with it than he bargained for Equipment and Features The 1992 Ford Taurus Wagon we got should be considered a near luxury car in my opinion The center console has a compartment in the top which one can store money and other things in If you lift the top under is a place for tapes and CDs or whatever else you like And just above that exactly the same as in my Tempo is an inverse LCD screen displaying the time brightly clearly and in inverse green and black all the time Along the drivers door is controls for powered windows locks and mirrors The version of the 1992 Taurus Wagon we got was filled with all the best features Exterior wise there was the roof rack the 15 inch alloy wheels no hubcaps just the pattern there and a nice classic light blue paint with dark grey highlights The air conditioning is wonderfully cold never had a problem with it Theres a small LCD above the controls for it which give you the ability to control the temperature to an exact degree in the car Though thanks to the engine being on those weak mounts fast acceleration is dangerous to the health of the car and should be avoided On the ceiling is controls for reading lamps and more interestingly a sunroof which retracts perfectly and adjustably with the button A screen can be drawn over the sunroof to block the light additionally if its bothersome The car creeks ominously in turns though its nothing to worry about im told Wind noise is otherwise minimal though even at high speeds It was easy to replace and upgrade and there was even for a spot for a subwoofer under the floor in the back wagon portion of the vehicle Its the perfect distance for wonderful bass which doesnt overpower Theres a knob to turn them on and off manually as well if you wish Furthermore that same stick controls the blinkers which are loathe to turn off automatically in a turn unless its very sharp Problems Oh boy My dad had serviced the car throughout its existence even though he hadnt previously owned it Dads the head mechanic at a Sunoco Ultra Service station knows many people around the area and has access to many good deals when people wish to sell their cars This is a problem he knew about beforehand though Next problem is one that still is present Another known problem with the Taurus is the windshield wiper electronics are flaky Though he knew what problems Taurus can have he knew the history of the car and had taken good care of it as had the previous owner Despite having 120 000 miles on it it was all highway miles as it had been driven about 50 miles each day to work and back And just barely worth it to fix it each individual time as well As nice as it looks and handles the 1992 Taurus Wagon is a time bomb and we know we ll have to replace it sometime soon even if we ll miss all its neat little features Those are major problems and I know it has suffered more in the past than just that Overall its miserably unreliable even if it is a comfy feature filled ride im afraid I ll break it each time I drive it b Conclusion The luggage volume is 463 cubic inches or 38 6 cubic feet which can be made much larger if you fold the back seat forward The Taurus Wagon can reasonably carry very large things in its spacious rear and has been used successfully as such for some time by us Theres a series of useful hooks in the back too to make sure things stay in one place It easily powers the car to a quick speed with little trouble and theres never a real lack of power from that 3 8 V6 Though im afraid to use it for fear of damaging the poor thing The Rack and Pinion power steering feels more floaty than my other cars with less feedback Its not not_necessarily not_a not_bad not_thing and does give a fair amount of feedback in the end its just easier to turn The antenna is mechanical and adjustable from the inside Additionally the front doors have keypads for keyless entry codes to unlock either one door or all doors depending on the code Inside the first noticeable thing is the leather seats Even with all the use they ve gotten they re all in wonderful condition for being ten years old And they are comfortable with electric adjustment for both front bucket seats and even air bladder along the lower back It wasnt not_really not_my not_fault not_I not_was

gets decent milage for the size of the car and engine itself 18 MPG city and 28 Highway is whats on the sticker and I average around 20 miles per gallon with the thing However our engine has been replaced with the 1996 model thanks to the older one needing to be rebuilt well see the next section for that It should be about the same though http www fueleconomy gov feg noframes 9151 shtml And up until recently all Fords were like this A big pain Even so there was lots of information available in the car anyhow thanks to the Digital Dash feature and the accompanying computer that came with it From miles per gallon at any given moment how long until you ll need to refuel again to MPH averages the computer is a nifty thing Plus I adore digital dashes even if this ones green screen is hard to

Neg,This car is very spacious The Taurus is pretty safe The Speedometer and tachometer are very clear The handling of the Taurus wagon is not not_spectacular The steering feel is somewhat heavy almost truck like The internal controls of the car are placed very well This does come at the expense of gas mileage These repairs were done at both great expense and great inconvenience The cargo space is simply massive larger than most other wagons and some SUVs The brakes are also very heavy although they work exceptionally well with the optional anti lock system The speedometer does not not_go not_very not_high not_so not_the not_exact not_speed not_is not_very not_easy not_to not_determine not_from not_a not_quick not_glance The window and lock controls are placed as well and are as easy to operate as those in Japanese cars The frame was not not_warped not_at not_all and the door was all that had to be fixed My father was hit on the side at highway speed and he walked away without a scratch the only result being a large dent on one door The 3 8 liter V6 gives only 140 hp but they are available at a low RPM 3800 and they are accompanied by a whopping 215 pounds foot of torque The Wagon looks nice enough Not terribly sleek but not not_heinously not_ugly like the 1996 and later Taurus models I personally think that this particular generation 92 95 is the best looking of all Taurus models While the seats are not not_exceptionally not_comfortable there is plenty of leg room front and back for just about any potential passenger Because of this fact long road trips are not not_a not_large not_hassle not_with not_the not_Taurus The Taurus is a good family hauler with decent power and good space however the reliability problems make it hard for me to recommend it even though I very much want to My father spends quite a bit of money on repairs most recently and notably he had to have the transmission rebuilt and he had to have extensive work done on the brakes My father owns the Taurus GL mid range model with the optional 3 8 liter V6 engine With a reasonable price this car is the perfect family hauler or at least it would be if were not not_for not_a not_few not_problems These numbers mean that the engine has more than enough muscle to tackle any hill or haul any load just so long as blazing speed or off the line performance are not not_needed not_Actually not_the not_acceleration not_is not_pretty not_good not_for not_a not_larger not_mid not_sized not_wagon In city driving the mileage is well under 20 miles per gallon Unfortunately this 3 8 liter V6 power plant is apparently one of the least reliable engines ever made by Ford Together with Fords standard average to below average reliability we have a volatile combination The only control that I do not not_like is the gear shifter attached to the steering column Unless you have the exact sequence memorized which is not not_too not_hard not_shifting not_gears is difficult Despite my preferential gripe this feature frees more floor space and makes possible seating for a small person between the driver and the front passenger On turns the car goes where you want it but torque steer is VERY heavy and the wheel does not not_smoothly not_spin not_back not_to not_its not_center not_but not_instead not_jerks not_and not_stops not_repeatedly not_on not_the not_way not_there not_Still not_the not_handling not_is not_appropriate not_to not_this not_type not_of not_car and compared to other American made station wagons it is actually pretty good The first serious driving lesson I ever had was in this car so I have a certain soft spot for it My father frighteningly guided me through the suburban roads of Concord Massachusetts as I learned the nuances of control and timing that comprise the art of driving I will always love the 1992 Ford Taurus for heralding me to the wonderful amazing world of driving But I must concede that it is a far from perfect piece of machinery
Neg,Do yourself a favor spend the extra on a Camry Dont get sucked in by lower priceing You WILL live to regret and wind up spending the same in the long run In general AVOID this car at all costs unless you LOVE to crawl under the car every night to fix something Oh the list could go one forever visit the read this before buying a ford taurus website My personal problems transmission replaced twice motor mounts three times ignition switch twice broken springs on the rear fuel pump whines brakes failed three times power steering hoses blew wiper motor failed plastic ends of radiator leaked and many more that I can not not_remember not_at not_present
Neg,In a tiny V8 This truck downright sucks The rear seat is no better very cramped It gets 67 584 feet per gallon Or more commonly referred to as 12 8 mpg The airconditioner is cold Very cold I love the airconditioner The radio has the curious gremlin of not not_shutting not_off not_sometimes The cupholders are great Easily holding anything up to huge drinks confidently It is very roomy you could easily seat six in the interior The paint is still beautiful even after 162 000 miles not not_on not_the not_same not_engine It has been alligned three times in the last year and was out of allignment yesterday Overall Why am I doing this Because my opinion of this truck has completely changed This truck is the SuperCab 4 6 Liter Automatic 4x4 XL with add ons Flare side pickup Pros Not many The radio sounds great and I love the controls easy to reach from the driver seat The seat in this truck is ridiculous Lack of lumbar always leaves me with a back ache There is no padding which leaves my backside sore and the headrest pushed your head forward Introduction Man I cant not_believe not_im not_doing not_this not_im not_breaking not_my not_own not_rule im updating and reposting the article It has transferred its weight from my love it list to my hate it list all in one day It will continue to be on although the button is in Styling has to be the worst We havent put any transmissions in it lack of power from the engine is why im guessing This truck will not not_hold not_an not_allignment not_After not_the not_first not_one not_wore not_off not_we not_replaced not_ball not_joints not_steering not_items not_among not_other not_things The engine sucks the gas mileage sucks the little things drive me crazy I do not not_recommend not_this not_truck not_Look not_elsewhere You are sitting very high in the truck command of the road is there you feel powerful but you arent It was gutless then I forgave it assuming that it was tired from 159 000 miles of service The doors are cool when you need to unlock them pull up on the handle and they are unlocked The engine that I thought was the original wasnt original replaced at 80 000 miles died at 159 000 miles Towing has to be less than 4 000 lbs Gas mileage is always nice this truck doesnt get it It gets gas footage The single key is also nice Neutral A third door is great albeit on the passenger side when it would be really helpful on the drivers side The new engine is worthless 4 6 liters of gas guzzling worthless junk Zero to sixty was measured not not_professionally to be 18 or 19 seconds It looks like its trying to be aerodynamic but at the same time appears as if it is going to fall on its nose One gas tank is enough right I expect two in Ford trucks Especially with this gas mileage Cons Bear with me this is going to take a while The bench seat in the front is stupid I hate it It moves with the driver so if the driver is short the passenger better hope s he is too This was with AC on not not_max on the highway with overdrive on This was my low average is about 15 with a maximum of 17 once 25 mph for two hours because of hazardous road conditions The cruise control freaked out on me I pushed resume assuming it would reach 65 mph assigned it looked down to the surprise of 80 mph and climbing Sometimes it wont work at all
Neg,This is in the space of nearly 8 years If you are independantly wealthy and gas prices dont not_affect not_you not_Go not_ahead So now because of a design flaw on Fords part I have endangered my brakes and wheels as well It gets 22 mi gal even though its shooting gas out of the top of the carborator Not to mention what it will likely do to the tires such as icing them up This seems a little steep doesnt it Especially since a catback system for my other vehicle was only 200 installed and that was tuned exhaust This situation concerns me a great deal and if I do not not_find not_satisfactory not_resolution not_for not_it I may have to lodge a complaint with Consumer Reports And also that they thought that I should bring the truck in so that they can make sure that theres no damage to the wheels or brakes They said that because the truck was no longer on its original warranty that the repair would not not_be not_done not_by not_Ford and that to have it done is about 700 The air bags are nigh on fatal for a person of my size and the seat has to be so far forward when I drive it that I look like a hood ornament To date this issue has not not_been not_resolved and I am about to trade the truck off on something more economical and less prone to breakage im sure theres more but its late and I cant not_remember not_anything not_else not_right not_now not_Storm And exhaust doesnt corrode that fast I dont not_care not_how not_many not_kms not_you not_put not_on not_it not_Based not_on not_the not_last not_10 not_months not_I not_might not_have not_to not_park

hydraulic pressure that stops this from being an issue but the system is only as good as its weakest part and when using the brute force method to break them free I would think that something

things ive encountered in the last 10 mos as they occur to me If you are under 5 8 this truck is way too big for you I am 5 4 and when I shift gears my legs rub against the dash indicating that the truck would likely break my legs in the event of a front end collison Why should I potentially be liable for a repair like this This seems a little bit ridiculous to me and frankly with the way that this truck has nickeled and dimed me for the last 10 months power steering pump oil pan gasket MAF sensor computer reprogrammed 2x a check engine light when I silly me decided to wash the engine back firing 17 mi ga combined driving block heater cord this was the last straw I dont not_even not_have not_the not_money not_to not_do not_this not_sort not_of not_work not_anymore It has steadily whittled my bank balance to practically nothing I have had it in for warranty work 4 times in the space of the first 6 months I had it paid a deductible 2 times as some of the work relied on parts and I was asked to bring it back a second time was charged for things that WERE on warranty when I called Ford Customer Care I was told that it was an issue between myself and the dealership and that Ford would not not_intervene The truck has great get up and go but a word of advice if your performance or milage decrease dont not_let not_them not_reprogram not_it not_it not_hasnt not_run not_run

to Ford of Canada This babys for you It ll quickly help you lose weight by first lightening your wallet spare change jar and mattress where you store that hidden stash of cash Kraft dinner for a month after repairs I researched the cost of a clutch in the event that I needed it 650 cdn for parts alone I nearly crashed the truck upon reciept of that information I bought the truck because I wanted to have something to haul materials for house renovations and for a horse trailer in the near future I learned afterwards that the modifications required to handle a horse trailer greatly exceeded the ins and payment savings of having purchased a 6cyl Why in the world would something as dangerous as the brakeline freezing due to the exhaust pipe being in front of the wheels not not_be not_a

purchased the truck from as well as the Sales manager Service manager and several other people of the dealership coverage that I purchased I had purchased this truck so that I could park a car that I thought was costing me a great deal of money I had thought that I would have a vehicle that I would have to do only routine maintenance on and that would be reliable and not not_a not_source of financial drain Soon I will have a clutch to do possibly brakes they say that my exhaust is shot I think its safe to say that I couldnt have done all this damage in the amount of time that ive had the vehicle I have had to do rear brakes once in my other vehicle and a clutch once as I learned to drive a manual on this vehicle and had a leaky rear main seal
Neg,We took our 1997 We were advised to take the problem to Ford directly We will have to go to Ford directly again for these additional expenses The repair was made but we were not not_informed not_that not_the not_problem not_was not_due not_to not_the not_safety not_recall Ford super cab truck in to be serviced as soon as we received the fuel line recall notice We might have been exposed to a fire or something worse had we not not_noticed not_the not_problem not_ourselves The bottom line is that Ford should be more proactive in repairing all safety recalls whether or not not_they not_are not_malfunctioning not_at not_the not_time As it stands now it is our understanding from two dealerships that Ford repairs only malfunctioning parts in safety recalls When the truck was parked we also noticed a strong gas odor Upon examining the street under the truck we saw gas dripping from our truck This seems to be an ongoing problem with Ford Motor Company and we feel they need an attitude adjustment if they are going to stay in business That dealership is going to reimburse us for repairs but we have other expenses we incurred due to the safety recall not not_being not_repaired not_when not_first not_inspected We immediately called for an appointment to arrange for the problem to be repaired which turned out to be the recalled fuel line unbeknown to us We wrote Ford and subsequently received a phone call from their customer relations center advising us that the part repaired WAS the safety recalled fuel line and to get in touch with the original dealer who made the inspection The servicing Ford dealer inspected the fuel line and stated that the fuel line had passed inspection and did not not_need not_replacing not_Evidently not_it not_is not_Fords not_policy not_not not_to not_replace not_a not_defective not_part not_unless not_it not_is not_malfunctioning not_We not_drove not_down not_to not_Florida not_about not_two not_months not_later not_and not_noticed not_poor not_gas not_mileage
Neg,It was a v8 and it had no power what so ever I bought a new 97 F150 and I had it only 4 months and traded it in To be honest I like a truck that is a little more flashy looking and this didnt not_make not_me not_say not_wow not_this not_was not_the not_only not_vehicle not_that not_we not_have not_owned not_that not_I not_could not_say not_I not_hated not_it not_I not_know not_some not_people not_are not_reading not_this not_and not_saying not_they not_love not_their not_truck and I am glad you like yours I didnt not_like not_mine We live on a mountain and I would have to shift into 3rd gear to climb it while little 4cys were flying up it I was embarrassed Sorry but when I put that much money into something I want it to perform for me and this truck didnt not_I not_think not_this not_truck not_is not_best not_suited not_for not_flat not_areas not_it not_did not_do not_well not_at not_highway not_speeds but like I said no power pulling a hill
Neg,The truck looks and rides nicely Then the oil pump went bad nearlt ruined motor Had to replace that and all 4 oxygen sensors But thats where it stops I own a 97 F150 supercab V6 with automatic transmission I now wish I had my old 5 speed Nissan back If you go to the NTSB website you will see that Ford has more recalls than any other car maker First some credit The truck developed a rattling noise that sounded like a loose exhaust part it turned out to be both catalytic coverters The catalytics failed because they were filled with coolant from the blown head gasket Total 1200 Next the alternator went out 100K miles They may not not_be not_as not_pretty or have all the bells and whistles but you can take one 200 K or more and never have to replace anything major with proper care This cost me 550 to replace During that time the check engine light had come on Why Because the head gasket on the right side had blown 97 K miles Then the a c clutch bearings gave out and made the most horrible noise while driving Replaced that When this truck gives up and its close now at 150 K because I think my head gasket is going again and catalytics are rattling again I will strip what parts are still good and sell them off then get a Nissan or Toyota With the kind of money you put into a car these days you expect value I bought the truck for more roominess and a bigger payload I bought it used in 99 with 33 K on it Since then I have been mailed 3 recalls one for fuel line leaks one for a timing cover gasket leak and one for a steering shaft possible breakage and accident
Neg,This is by far the most annoying thing about the car Assets The back seat is shallow and uncomfortable for anyone over 5 tall This has always bugged me Controls are laid out fairly well The direction controls for airflow break really easily flimsy brittle small pieces of plastic No more forcing the car into reverse or repeatedly pressing the clutch until it goes They didnt not_load not_up not_a not_lot not_of not_features not_on not_the not_stalks not_which not_is not_nice The knob that adjusts the tilt of the front seat is hard to reach hard to turn Okay why do they make automatics with a tach as standard equipment but its optional equipment for a stick The middle back seat restraint is NOT SUITABLE for a carseat trust me on this The dead man foot rest is awful It comes with dual front airbags the passenger side cannot not_be not_turned not_off not_which not_I not_wish not_it not_could The front seats are comfy for the short in stature Ford finally fixed the sticky reverse gear box problem some will know and understand what I mean It has a full body crash frame a nice safety feature I hope to never use I did not not_get not_the not_abs not_brakes not_I not_dont not_happen not_to not_like not_abs It has some feature that will drop the engine out in a major crash also not not_tested not_Exterior not_Green not_aluminum not_wheel not_covers not_molded not_bumpers not_nothing not_special not_Interior not_Light not_gray not_green not_illumination not_lights One side is the wiper controls and the other is the lights Cruise controls are on the steering wheel at thumb height Cant stand the rest position for hands at 4 and 8 o clock the new recommended safe position Two map lights plus a 3rd light with door open delay timer in the center front Large glovebox shallow door pockets for both front doors Adjustable height restraints are nice Rear has two shoulder restraints and one middle lap belt Features Power windows It has a cubbyhole under the stereo for expansion or storage 4 cds fit ok Hard to get into in 3rd or 5th Next to the emergency brake is a retractable cup holder Only holds medium size to go drinks or 12 oz cans sometimes tips Horn is still in the center of the steering wheel but you gotta push hard Air heat controls nicely laid out well lit air is good heat takes a bit of time I replaced the factory stereo but the speakers are ok unless you re an audiophile all four in the doors I own a 1996 5 speed v4 gl version of this car Happens to be green the most popular color I think so be sure you know where you parked Mine does not not_have not_all not_the not_bells not_and not_whistles not_I not_was not_looking not_for not_a not_reasonable not_priced not_family not_car not_and not_thats not_what not_I not_got not_Safety not_features Work well rear go only to child height child lockout Power mirrors good Remote entry About worthless you have to practically stand at the door to get them to work even with brand new battery Problems this will take some time get a drink Okay first the latch that releases the fuel door has never worked I often have to go out of the car to pry it open cant not_wait not_until not_the not_day not_I not_cant not_refuel This year model did not not_come not_with not_the not_split not_rear not_seats not_a not_MUST not_for not_all not_cars not_of not_this not_type not_and not_a not_HUGE not_oversight not_on not_the not_part not_of not_Ford not_A not_rear not_seats not_that not_fold not_down not_even not_the not_whole not_seat not_is not_necessary and this one could have sure used it The engine temperature gauge constantly shows the engine as almost in the red Dealership told me this was normal and they showed me a Ford white paper about it The engine is LOUD and if you dont not_have not_the not_radio not_on not_you not_ll not_go not_nuts In fact gear box is nice as is clutch on this car For a four cylinder engine performs nicely Dont expect to race anyone but you can get it up to 90 without the car shaking to death dont not_try not_this not_with not_a not_91 not_escort not_Gas not_mileage is good Engine is laid out and marked well enough to know whats where Trunk space is large but beware the hinges which can crush tall items placed under it Overall Would be a nice cheap secondhand car but leaves much to be desired at new full price Has had 2 recalls so far
Neg,The speakers are the current problem It has been recalled twice This car has given us nothing but trouble My wife and I recently acquired a used 1996 Ford Contour We have to refill at least once a week It will most definitely beat most small cars buses and semi trucks The bass levels at their highest setting will give most rap songs a little beat but not not_a not_boost not_or not_a not_bang This car is great for those guys who like to race little old ladies at the red light We were looking for something else but the car dealer convinced us this was the car for us Well it does have excellent pick up or get up and go That may attribute to the bad gas mileage We have also had problems with the air conditioner and the brakes within less than a year from when we bought it It also does not not_get not_good not_gas not_mileage The right speakers will periodically stop working In addition to that the bass has never been really good but I do like to have a system that can at least vibrate the car a little My opinion of this car and most Ford cars is that they are prone to failure Dont sneeze near it or kick the tires or else it could fall apart Maybe Fords just dont not_like not_me We are looking for a way to affordably get rid of it In all fairness I may be a little bias because I use to own an 86 Ford Escort and it gave me a large amount of problems and cost me too much money After the Escort I have developed a negative opinion towards and Ford compact car but this Contour is proving my opinion right I was hoping that I was wrong about how bad Ford cars are but the Ford Contour that we bought has proven me more right than ever before Positive comments
Neg,The only problem I cant not_get not_fixed that I hate would have to be whipping around corners It feels like the Wheels will fall off when you go 15 around a corner the tires screeching no matter what the air pressure It is NOT a Honda dont not_confuse not_it not_as not_one not_it not_is not_Big not_Bulky not_and not_sorta not_slow not_Dont not_try not_to not_break not_a not_speed not_record One day in the morning I was getting gas I learned the gas was on the opposite side of the car ok I ll reverse it pull to the other side IF I COULD ONLY SHIFT IT OUT OF PARK Myself being a young guy went to a Car Dealer Car Happy and wanted a car looked around was limited to an Automatic Transmission Looking Around I was surprised to have seen a big white Ford Contour for such a cheap price I test drove it big lots of buttons Great huh They Conned me in to buying it so I bought it thank God I got the Extended Warantee The Car was in the shop many times The Gear shifter was broken had to tear it off allright I got out of there Later that day strange Windows going up slowly Starter sounded like it wasnt not_ever not_gonna not_start not_again not_was not_driving not_all not_of not_a not_sudden not_wouldnt not_go not_over not_30 and it decided to stall Got it fixed fine besides the foggyness of the front lights which ruined any attractive qualities the car may have had the Problems with Turning axle the belts to be replaced the parking light coming on while I was driving it was a good car Looked better at night great power if you turn the Air Conditioner off and there is noone but you in the car cant not_get not_that not_with not_a not_Honda not_Good not_first not_car not_if not_you not_have not_a not_warantee not_and not_a not_loner not_car
Neg,We really enjoyed owning a new car It ran great and we were very pleased with the outside body and all the functions of the motor Then a week later the passenger side broke also Neither of the cranks had much use at any time At about 20 months the driver side window crank broke off and the dealer said it was not not_under not_warranty We found the interior very disappointing From the first week we had the car there were problems with the interior This vehicle was a first time lease for my husband and I It was the only car we qualified for so our choices were limited This molding broke 4 times in 2 years and has to be replaced each time which put the car in the shop for at least one day This car drives smoothly but if you are looking for good wear and tear this car is not not_the not_one not_I not_can not_not not_see not_children not_doing not_well not_in not_this not_car The carpet pulled away from the frame and it took 18 months for them to get the parts to fix it We also had problems with the plastic molding that enclosed the seat belts
Neg,The drive is nice The handling of the car was decent There are cheap plastic dash boards for one thing It is more suited for 16 30 year olds This thing will whip you back like a rag doll The unspacious trunk of the car is another bad part of the model If you want a big truck with a sporty look Id recommend getting a Chevy Monte Carlo Engine It doesnt really have a racer type look that Ford tried to do with the vehicle Interior If you ever put the pedal to the metal in a V8 model you would feel that power immediately The car is not not_a not_good not_deal not_at not_all not_I not_would not_recommend not_buying not_an not_older not_Mustang not_if not_you not_were not_interested As a young car enthusiast I went to a local Ford dealership and saw a nice GT Mustang with a V8 in it Very nice The changes compared to an older 1994 model of the Mustang sport very few changes which make me disgust this car The car is kinda low and elderly or just plain old people will have trouble getting into the small back of the car But my friend told me that a Mustang Cobra is a lot more powerful and a lot more expensive as well Bottom Line They look very potentially destructive in the way that even a little whap would break it The manual shift control is a pain in the butt The Mustang comes in either basic V6 form a V8 GT engine or a Cobra style one which I am not not_sure not_how not_it not_handles But if you were to invest a little bit more money you could buy a V8 Mustang with 260hp and 220 pounds of torque Not only is the car a manual something I hate but have to live with but the shifter blocks the controls to the CD deck The new V6 engine is pretty nice with a 3 8L with 190hp which is nice but not not_as not_good as my much cheaper Monte Carlo which has 215hp If your thinking about getting a Mustang for the power dont not_A not_camaro will give you around a 5 2L with a lot more horsepower for only a couple thousand more dollars Driven The only good thing about buying a car like this is that they are very easy to upgrade and modify thanks to numerous magazines devoted to it wheres my Monte Carlo magazine Versions When you think of Mustangs the first thing that comes to mind is a muscle car Mustangs have long been classified with such cars as camaros firebirds chevlles and others When you race it against another car or just press the acceleration all the way the car makes a nice rumble which will make you squeal like a school girl with excitement It was a lot better than my Monte being a much heavier vehicle the Monte is Taking turns and corners the Mustang handles nicely I would have to say Price But the question for this model is that with the new sporty look of the exterior which looks gay to me does the engine and the rest of the car hold up to my expectations The climate control was bland like in any Ford I would recommend Chevys as being best for a nicely weathered interior Getting into the back seat is much more difficult than I expected Rather pain in the butt task to perform If you have 20 000 to blow on a car I would not not_recommend not_spending not_it not_on not_a not_Mustang not_Buying not_a not_nice not_Firebird not_with not_a not_V8 not_and not_a not_lot not_more not_horsepower not_and not_torque not_with not_a not_better not_interior not_and not_exterior not_look is a much better investment When I say that the Monte Carlo is better heres why I drive a 1995 Monte Carlo with a 5 year warranty on everything and I got the car for only 8 000 dollars more than half what I would have to pay for a new Mustang My car is better looking more powerful since I added a Venom Computer Module which totaled my horsepower to nearly 300hp and my car will last just as long with its warranty REMEMBER THIS IS EPINIONS MEANING ITs MY OPINION i Exterior The new model designs I dont not_particularily not_like not_I not_am not_more not_into not_a not_bigger not_car or if its smaller and sportier like the new Mustangs I would like them with a lower center of gravity and with a big sporty spoiler on the back I would ve liked it if they would ve come out with more of a japanese car like version of the mustang if they wanted to create a more sporty version of the car Yet with this edition of the Mustang the car is small not not_good not_for not_a not_four not_seater and looks awful to me
Neg,It isnt not_worth not_the not_money The canvas lets the heat in the car This car was having problems from the moment we purchased it NEW The gas wasnt not_bad but the pick up wasnt not_as not_fast not_as not_I not_had not_driven not_in not_Cameros not_and not_Firebirds We dont not_drive not_it not_fast not_all not_the not_time and we didnt not_do not_anything not_out not_of not_the not_ordinary not_to not_make not_this not_happen But I just knew this Mustang was going to be different Laserred camel color top and leather seats CD player Mach sound system and all the bells and whistles We miss the Mustang a lot the dealer gave us 22 000 trade in after only 1 year and they are now selling it for 25 500 This is my third time owning a Mustang I purchased 2000 GT Convertible August 1999 my dream car this is my third and the other 2 had transmission and BIG engine problems They will make a nice profit on it We felt that if we kept the vehicle that we would have continuous problems with the rear end and transmission For the third time im disappointed Read my review on the 1998 Laserred Mustang Convertible and the 1995 White Mustang Convertible I purchased a Ford Ranger in 1994 and was happy with it Not a problem Ford knows how to do trucks but cars thats a different story Needless to say we traded the Mustang in on a 2001 Explorer Sports Trac We love it We are cured of Mustang fever It ended up that some bearings or something in the rear end were no good to begin with When we got the car back it seemed faster but over a few weeks time it began making noise again We sweat like a hore in church thats how hot it gets in the summer riding in the Mustang with the top up 28 000 you would think they could build a car that would last It just didnt not_squeal not_when not_I not_wanted not_it not_to not_The not_car was sluggish I had just turned in my 1998 Mustang Convertible 6 cylinder because there were transmission problems with it and I heard the 8 cylinder didnt not_have not_the not_same not_problems not_WRONG When I had the top up because of rain and most of the time I drove with the top down in the rain as long as you drive you wont get wet I could hear a humming noise in the rear of the car Every week it got louder The leather seats were nice but they are low to the ground and your legs are extended so it is not not_as not_comfortable as a car but its better than other sports cars ive ridden in The sound system is to die for We live in south Florida and its HOT there and we put the top up and the sun beats on the canvas and the a c doesnt compensate for the heat
Neg,The new mustangs dont not_really not_impress not_me not_that not_much It takes corners well and its ok on gas But only one friend I would say get something with a little bigger back seat The mustangs have gone way down in price i think that is why they are becoming a little more bland One of my best friends have one and i find it a pain in the butt to take people around in it Dont get me wrong the car looks allright bt inside unless you are in the fron seat you are going to be very unconfortable The sound system in it sounds nice even without the subs he added Hes got a 6 cylinder and it feals like its got alot of power but only 190 HP my truck can out run that but of coarse i have a standard Having a CD player and a Tape was a good thing When i was looking for a car i test drove a 98 GT and i was impressed wth everything except the size of the back seat I will write a epinion on it too look for it The mustang carries a great name but they are turning int a 2 seater that really doesnt have the power that it used to ever since they stopped makin the 5 0 engines in 94 Overall you get a car wth a small backseat ok gas mileage looks kinda nice a name that every1 knows sounds ok It is great for my friend he is single and usually carries one friend
Neg,The SS version is extremely attractive They are really cool The stereo on this Mustang just really sucks The Camaro majorly wins the stereo battle between the two cars What a compromise between a convertible and a coupe These components are logically placed and easy to use Gotta love that stereo It does need an update but it is still a really nice looking car The components in this car are functional and are more modern than the Mustangs This stereo is comparable to the stereo I had specially installed in my Yukon Theres not not_as not_much competition to compete with This car is less comfortable than the Mustang but who cares They definitely arent pleasing the sports car enthusiast who wants to go tearing up the hiways with the tunes bumpin In the Mustang you just hear the buzz of the engine while in the Camaro you hear the roar of the exhaust Definitely awesome If you want comfort buy a Buick Sports cars should tear up the race track and leave two black lines down the middle of the streets They are the same dials and stereo systems that used to be in the old F 150s back before they changed to their space ship design The Camaros handling was a little better I think Just my opinion though Everybodys different I loved listening to the exhaust sound in this car It would save me a few thousand of having to upgrade the Mustangs Oh and an addition on the Camaro you gotta love those T Tops The Camaro is one fast car I had the chance to open the throttle to this bad boy and boy did it move Amazing Braking was good on both The second thing that really drives me crazy about this car is the way it receives so much kudos for being more comfortable Sports cars should not not_be not_judged not_on not_comfort The front seats are fine by my standards for two people to go wherever they want to go The back seats arent too roomy at all but sports cars dont not_need not_back not_seats This car is not not_near not_as not_common not_as not_the not_Mustang not_I not_might not_see not_one not_or not_two not_a not_day and when I do its a treat Put on some shiny rims and flowmasters in this baby and your bound to get some attention The components all seem functional they just dont not_look not_flashy not_at not_all not_The not_Camaros not_arent not_a not_whole not_lot not_better but they still are better Camaro I will talk about the same things in the same order with maybe one or two additions There is no other way of saying it This stereo is a senior citizens stereo in the way that it has little bass and needs to be cranked near full blast before it can satisfy a music lover I guess they re pairing it with the comfortable interior to please their family car buyers These seats were probably just designed to give grocery bags added comfort o But really comfort is not not_a not_huge not_factor not_in not_buying not_a not_sports not_car not_Your not_in not_the not_wrong not_class not_of not_cars not_if not_thats not_what not_your not_looking not_for not_Even not_though not_the not_Stang not_gets not_the not_kudos not_for not_looks not_I not_still not_think not_the not_Camaro not_is not_a not_nice not_looking not_car The constant praising of the comfort on this car being better is really quite moronic Sure comfort helps but sports cars should be judged on the length of the black strips left behind o The Mustang is a nice looking car I do have to say that it looks slightly better than the Camaro Its a bit boxy but it still wins this battle If I was to buy one I would probably buy a Camaro because they look so awesome when they are fixed up whereas the Mustangs start looking a little unearthly as nearly all of Fords vehicles do With Camaros you can get more for you money so ive read in Motor Trend and just about every other auto magazine out there Once again that stereo might make the decision for me though I have never owned either a Chevrolet Camaro or a Ford Mustang My opinion is based purely on my sporadic drives Mustang My first impression of the Mustang is that I see it on the street WAY to frequently Everybody and their brothers aunts grandmas cousins and co workers has on Who would want to buy a car that everyone else has Not me How am I supposed to show off in a car that everyone else has It is really an awesome stereo with a ton of bass and enough volume to lift you out of your chair A definite pro in my book Driving both of these cars was a different experience for me because I was used to a big Yukon but the Stangs driving position was a little higher which made it easier to get used to at first but the Camaros was just as good once you got used to it When you drive a car that isnt not_yours not_the not_driving not_position not_is not_always not_a not_little not_wierd On to the driving I found that this car

Neg,It came with a fairly decent package That is about all I liked The Mustang was not not_a not_bad not_car not_to not_drive but it just wasnt not_a not_sports not_car The ride was very bumpy and when cornering it felt like you are going to lose control What I didnt not_like not_which not_proves not_my not_theory not_that not_Fords not_are not_made not_very not_cheaply is the abundance of plastic parts in the interior It was quite stylish with its angled curves and fake ram air ducts I also liked the sterio it looked better than the ones in my Chevys but did not not_put not_out not_the not_sound not_like not_them It had air cruise power windows and locks a tape player and a CD player I also liked the cruise control on the steering wheel it was much easier to get to than on my Chevys which have it on the turn signal switch It had the sports car look but not not_the not_sports not_car feel I think I ll stick to my Chevy muscle cars and trucks for now my 85 Monte SS is 10 times the car the Mustang is Thank you Ford once again the Mustang turned me completely off of buying a sports car I recently went on a trip to Kentucky and I had to rent a car I wanted a mid sized sedan but the rental office didnt not_have not_any not_so not_they not_decided not_to not_upgrade not_me not_to not_this not_little not_car not_I not_wont not_call not_it not_a not_sports not_car not_because not_it not_lacked not_the not_performance not_I not_would not_like not_in not_a not_sports not_car not_and not_it not_was not_nothing not_compared not_to not_my not_Monte not_Carlo not_SS not_even not_when not_it not_was not_all not_stock not_I not_guess not_you not_cant not_compare not_apples not_to not_oranges not_though not_the not_Mustang not_did not_only not_have not_a not_V6 not_which not_had not_less not_power not_than not_my not_Blazers not_V6 not_First not_I not_will not_start not_off not_with not_what not_I not_liked not_about not_the not_Mustang not_I not_did not_like not_the not_way not_the not_exterior not_looked The doors were about 99 plastic which made it very uncomfortable to rest my arm on it It was cold in the mornings and when it got hot during the day my arm would stick to it The dash was also all plastic and did not not_look not_good not_at not_all not_Every not_part not_of not_the not_car not_that not_I not_touched not_felt not_like not_it not_was not_going not_to not_break not_if not_I not_put not_any not_pressure not_on not_it not_Next is the lack of power Now I know it was only a V6 so I dont not_want not_a not_million not_comments not_telling not_me not_how not_I not_should not_drive not_a not_5 not_0 not_or not_a not_Cobra not_and not_see not_if not_my not_opinion not_changes not_I not_have not_driven not_a not_Camero not_with not_a not_V6 not_and not_I not_am not_not not_being not_at not_all not_one not_sided not_toward not_Chevy not_here not_it not_did not_have not_much not_more not_power not_I not_tried not_to not_spin not_up not_the not_tires not_a not_little not_on not_the not_Mustang not_and not_the not_only not_way not_I not_could not_was not_by not_doing not_a not_brake not_torque
Neg,There werent too many features in this particular Mustang The A C works great Automatic seat adjustments mirror adjustments windows and locks My father recently fulfilled his dream of owning a sports vehicle There were built in cup holders and a covered compartment for storing things In fact my stepmother got a speeding ticket within 2 weeks of owning this car It did include a pretty decent stereo system with AM FM radio cassette player and CD player You ve got to really pay attention to the speedometer because its easy not not_to not_realize not_just not_how not_fast not_you not_re not_driving not_this not_baby When pops showed up at my house with his new toy my first impression of the car was Wow It sure was a beauty Then with a simple push of a button the roof smoothly went down Away we went Not as powerful as I expected a sports car to be but a very smooth and comfortable ride He went out and purchased a brand spanking new blue convertable Mustang I guess when you reach the age of 71 you can do whatever you please And he didnt not_have not_to not_twist not_my not_arm not_to not_take not_a not_test not_drive not_Getting not_into not_the not_vehicle not_was not_quite not_an not_obstacle not_I not_think not_this not_car not_is not_made not_for not_people not_under not_5 not_feet not_tall There is very little room for passengers in the back seat and they must have very short legs to even have some remote comfort Feeling pretty cramped I just cant not_imagine not_making not_a not_long not_trip not_in not_this not_car If you re single have the money the insurance is outrageous and enjoy expensive showy cars this one is for you Personally once the novelty had worn off I was glad I own a truck Sure it was thrilling driving this toy around I particularly enjoyed the looks on my neighbors faces as I passed them by But is this car worth the price just to impress people I think not not_As not_a not_family not_man not_this not_vehicle not_would not_not not_make not_a not_good not_choice And it felt odd sitting so close to the road im used to driving my Chevy full sized pickup so this was a very unusual feeling for me Almost like sitting in a little go cart Lowering the top was pretty easy once I figured out that I had to have the car in park and the emergency brake set
Neg,The car is magnificent But it was very tight for space on the inside Be sure to check my review on the new 2000 model Mercury Cougar V 6 Sport Coupe I test drove this vehicle and I have to say that it was really nice decked out and it gave a smooth ride If you usually travel in your car with more than one person other than yourself I would not not_recommend not_this not_car not_Although not_If not_you not_want not_something not_sporty not_and not_nice not_I not_would not_definitely not_get not_this not_car not_although not_everyone not_else not_already not_has not_one not_I not_would not_recommend not_the not_2000 not_Mercury not_Cougar not_for not_everyone
Neg,Think twice Considering a new 2000 Ford Mustang GT The key statement here is for the price paid The car has been in the shop constantly since I purchased the car new late last year In fact dont not_think not_about not_it not_at not_all not_im not_on not_my not_fourth not_late not_model not_Mustang not_and not_definitely not_my not_last The quality of the vehicles has gone down hill over the past two years and Fords service and support structure is even worse However the rigidity of the car is marginal Several rattles and squeaks are present and one might think the car was going to fall apart over rough roads It still has unresolved problems that both the dealers and Ford are unable to diagnose and fix ive communicated with several other 2000 Mustang GT owners with similar problems ruling out the possibility that my Mustang is anomaly If you cant not_afford not_a not_real not_performance not_car and are willing to put up with marginal quality and poor service then this is the right car Just be sure to sell it before the warranty expires The car has excellent power for the price paid is fun to drive and looks good with the top down Handling is good once the stock tires are replaced with a set of real performance tires
Neg,The motor had gone out Back to the Ford dealership with no rental car What is wrong with this car you ask EVERYTHING That very day the drivers side window wouldnt not_come not_back not_up not_after not_I not_put not_it not_down It took them two whole days to replace the motor I was furious I went to the Nissan dealership and test drove a Maxima Their reply I can give you the number to Hertz Car Rental Great I thought and Ford is going to pick up the bill right WRONG The 2000 Mustang GT is a total lame excuse for a sportscar I purchased a 2000 red Mustang GT in November of 1999 I was the first in my town to have one of the new bodystyles Ford told me I was on my own Come to find out the alternator had gone bad Ford replaced the alternator and I picked up my car the following morning No big deal right They didnt not_even not_seem not_surprised and they werent apologetic or understanding After waiting THREE hours and missing a day of work the wrecker showed up and took my pretty red Mustang to the Ford dealership Wait I thought I dont not_have not_transportation not_now not_I not_phoned not_Ford not_and not_asked not_for not_a not_rental not_or not_loaner not_car The car was loaded with sunroof leather CD with the premium speakers all power you name it this car had it I was happy with my decision to buy a Mustang until the car wouldnt not_start not_one not_morning not_My not_little not_red not_Stang not_was not_only not_4 not_months not_old and had less than 6 K miles on her I phoned the Ford dealership and explained my problem If you re considering purchasing a Ford atleast drive a Chevy first I thank my friend everyday for referring me there Dont make the same mistake I did I try to let everyone know about my mishap with the Rustang and in doing so I came across the following website www fordtruckssuck com Seems im not not_the not_only not_one whos had NUMEROUS problems with Ford That was not not_what not_I not_was not_looking not_for not_A not_friend not_told not_me not_to not_drive not_a not_Camaro not_Z28 not_I not_did not_just not_that not_The not_power not_ride not_and not_handling not_was not_phenomenal not_I not_had not_to not_have not_it not_After not_picking not_up not_my not_POS not_Mustang not_GT not_I not_took not_it not_straight not_to not_the not_Chevy not_dealership not_before not_anything not_else not_could not_break not_on not_it not_and not_traded not_it not_in not_for not_a not_2000 not_Chevrolet not_CamaroZ28 not_I not_will not_be not_writing not_my not_review not_of not_my not_new not_Z not_in not_the not_near not_future
Neg,Then the squeaking started Then the front one They wouldnt not_stay not_buckled Then the engine started having problems Then it ate 3 more tapes I want a new radio The dash didnt not_squeak not_for not_almost not_2 not_full not_blocks not_After not_that not_the not_back not_seatbelt not_broke The dash squeaked the whole time the car was on The really annoying high pitched squeaking Then the cassette player broke Ford said it was my tape Ok No can do Its now my car I think I saw the paint turn slightly yellow Naw must have been my imagination It couldnt be turning into a lemon Ford built cars Ford Tough So I went to work in it It was fine For about a month Then everything inside the car started breaking Everything made out of plastic that had to move open or shut broke Its a 1995 and has been in the shop 31 times Oh yeah well they knew that the radio wasnt not_replaced not_they not_just not_didnt not_have not_one not_in not_But not_the not_fixed not_the not_squeak not_Cool So I had to make another appointment to come in and have it put in A few years ago in 1995 I bought a new Ford Mustang I wanted to buy an American car I didnt not_even not_think not_of not_getting not_anything not_else not_I not_was not_trading not_in not_my not_Ford not_F not_150 not_I not_wanted not_better not_gas not_milage not_something not_cute Ok bring it in and im just out for the cost of the tapes I pick up my car and guess what Same radio I had got some hair spray on the clock and I could see that the same pots were still there The first morning after I bring home my little silver bullet it wont start Ford has to come over and give me a new battery I told them to come pick it up and take it back I expect for the car to be able to start after having it for like 12 hours
Neg,The answer yes they can Why oh why do people continually by the Ford Mustang Then at least I would know that my car would outlive me The answer is because they are cheap and some people think that they look cool If I wanted a mid sized car that was reasonably quick and rather sporty looking I would opt for an Accord coupe In the past the Mustang was am amazing car and it single handedly defined the muscle car genre but the same cannot not_be not_said not_for not_the not_Mustang not_of not_today Is this not not_humiliating not_to not_a not_Mustang not_owner Can the Mustang loyalists hold their heads up proudly knowing that there are a plethora of more superior vehicles out there The fact that Ford upped the power output in the current generation Mustang V 8s just goes to show that Mustang owners everywhere were getting trounced at red lights by the GM faithful in their Camaros and Firebirds The Mustang is a car that formerly had a proud heritage and used to stand toe to toe with the Chevrolet Camaro and the Pontiac Firebird Now decades later the only car the base level V 6 powered Mustang can beat is the Honda Accord
Neg,It is your choice Why not not_buy not_a not_used not_Corvette What if they were the same price Of course the real sports enthusiast get leather and all the options If you cant not_afford not_the not_options not_then not_dont not_buy not_the not_car not_in not_the not_first not_place But if you want to be noticed have some prestige and spend your money smart The Ford Mustang Convertible is fast good looking and fun to drive Corvettes and BMWs are great sports cars too It will keep its value longer A Mustang loses 50 of its value after only two years Or why not not_buy not_a not_brand not_new not_BMW not_the not_entry not_level not_300 not_series not_for not_23 not_000 not_base Then buy a Corvette used or a new BMW A Mustang is great but it is just too expensive The decision is easy The Ford Mustang is a clear example of a car that is just too expensive A Mustang Convertible starts out at 21 000 The options are an integral part to the Mustang ABS Leather Spoiler Power Seats dual and the Smokers Package aka the Cell Phone Package Doesnt everyone who drives a sports car have a cell phone This will keep its value more and a BMW base model with no options is a lot more luxurious and more prestigious than a Mustang Convertible loaded whether or not not_it not_is not_a not_Cobra not_or not_GT They should Anyway my point is this A Mustang starts at 21 K but add tax warranty all the options delivery and the price gets to 27 500 And this is the price for an LX version not not_the not_GT not_or not_Cobra not_So I would rather take this money and buy a real sports car that is worth the money I think the Mustang Convertible should be worth 20 000 for everything That is reasonable I find the current cost not not_reasonable because there are many more prestigious faster cars out there
Neg,It was out of control The car would accelerate to wide open throttle from a stop When I first bought it it wasnt not_even not_safe For instance the car dies a couple times a week at least during deceleration It is embarassing and it is dangerous when it happens on a curve It is unfortunate that this car was not not_tweaked not_a not_little not_more not_because3 not_it not_would not_be not_awesome The only way I could stop it was to turn the key off After 16 k though Ford has been unable to trace other problems They did fix the horn on the second try though Good car if you like to have a black box in your car and press a little button when you fear for your life This car has plently of power and handles well Also it is a pretty goos head turner in performance red Unfortunately mine has been plagued with problems Furthermore Ford especially my dealership has been very unreceptive and downright mean I have bought Fords my entire life expect for a little Toyota pickup once and this will be my last
Neg,This can vary with no fault states Thats a lot of money to lose Or maybe a vehicle that large is not not_needed not_at not_all The new VW Beetle gets better crash test ratings that most Ford Lincoln SUVs and trucks Take the money you saved and use it for kids college or early retirement They plan for this by charging a lot higher premium on SUVs than normal size cars I know I wrote an similar review on the Lincoln Navigator but these SUVs are identical and the same information applies This will add somewhere between 100 to 250 a month to your car payment Okay gas is cheap now but for how long You should get a quote from your insurance company first Now on average the Expedition puts out over 3 times the carbon dioxide of a normal sized car This really angers people who care about the environment and causes them to do things to protest against this One of the popular things is SUV tagging Which means it gets 12 5 miles per gallon or less average Meaning that a Expedition driver is paying on average 3 to 4 times more for gas that a car driver This is a new trend and who knows where it will go But do you want to constantly worry about your expensive Expedition being vandalized and then pay for the repairs Thats just more costs to worry about Like keeping your vehicle in your garage Not the Expedition and most large SUVs they wont fit unless you have a custom oversized garage another expense But if you leave is outside its always dirty and thats a lot of SUV to wash or have washed One more popular misconception about large SUVs is that they are safer for families When it goes back up typically the resale value on the Expedition and other large SUVs goes down considerably no one wants something that is going to use that much gas when the cost is unsteady Do your research first on any SUV I recommend outlining why you need an SUV maybe a minivan would be better because you can save 10 000 to 15 000 have a safer more versatile vehicle and get better gas mileage For the most part they are not not_Especially not_the not_Expedition not_its not_based not_of not_the not_Ford not_F not_150 not_chassis not_which not_has not_terrible not_ratings not_because not_it not_is not_still not_a not_truck not_body not_with not_out not_properly not_designed not_crumple not_zones not_or not_a not_firewall not_keeping not_the not_engine not_out not_of not_your not_lap not_Please not_check not_http not_www not_iihs not_org not_first Of course unless you have 35 000 to spend on one you are going to have a high car payment Which is obvious most consumers expect this But did you budget the high fuel cost as well A Ford Expedition weights between 5 424 to 5 774 pounds Because of this it has a V8 engine Where they ll put bumper stickers on your SUV say things like your changing the climate and you dont not_care not_about not_the not_air not_Please not_check not_out not_the not_sites not_I not_have not_listed not_below not_for not_more not_information not_on not_this not_http not_abcnews not_go not_com not_sections not_us not_DailyNews not_madtaggers not_001225 not_html not_http not_www not_baaction not_org not_SUVticket not_index not_html not_http not_www not_idontcareaboutair not_com not_bumpers not_index not_shtml not_http not_www not_charm not_net not_marc not_chronicle not_suv not_may01 not_html not_http not_poseur not_4x4 not_org not_topten not_html Then theres insurance Because the Expedition is big and heavy if the driver gets into an accident it will cause a lot of property damage and injuries that your insurance company will have to pay for On top of that there is a big risk that the drivers or drivers family of the smaller cars will sue you Which means you and or your insurance company could be out a lot of money To bring up a few important points about large SUVs to consider before purchasing As you know large SUVs have been stirring up a lot of controversy lately that buyers should know about I recently purchased a new car but considered an SUV first and did a lot of research into them and promptly changed my mind First of all there are lots off hidden costs on large SUVs like the Expedition
Neg,But my view on these new laws is for another day It looks too cheap and well its just not not_as not_stylish as the newer models The controls are similar to the newer models but the dash is just downright cheesy looking At least with this car going to the gas station is a little less frequent then in my car To top that off the wiper blades sit too high and can sometimes block my vision of the road The center console is broken and even the ash tray cover at one point broke which was probably my fault The exhaust system for example was replaced and six months later it goes again and a new one is needed The suspension is shot If you hit a bump hard you are going to FEEL it big time You could say try an alignment job thing is with this car you cant not_afford not_the not_money not_to not_keep not_up not_with not_the not_repairs The driver and passenger side windows are ready to break and are very loose and you can tell any time you go over bumps The seats are pretty comfortable though except its very hard to use the lever to make the seat go up because those are breaking too The heat in the car really cant not_be not_considered not_heat and the air conditioning in the summer is non existent and for someone like me who cant not_handle not_heat not_this not_a not_problem The car is in need of some more repairs and im sure of it It seems like you can never keep up with this car Its almost saying please put me out of my misery half the time There is also a possibility that this car also has a carbon monoxide leak and I have been encouraging my boyfriend to have that checked out as soon as possible I really dont not_like not_the not_interior not_of not_his not_car not_either In fact one side of the car appears to lean a little bit With new brakes the car will come to a stop in a very short amount of time if you have to slam on the brakes but with worn brakes start praying basically The transmission even needed to be rebuilt but perhaps that was just age Maybe if Ford had made better quality parts that lasted maybe this car would not not_have not_had not_so not_many not_problems not_I not_have not_written not_this not_as not_a not_warning not_to not_anyone not_who not_would not_consider not_buying not_a not_used not_Mustang not_of not_this not_year or before I love my boyfriend dearly but his car is another story His 1992 Mustang LX is a car Id love to shoot over and over again I have had just as much experience driving this car as I have had riding it in Driving it didnt not_use not_to not_be not_so not_bad not_until not_the not_cars not_mileage not_went not_up and of course so did the repair bills The car was bought with about 70 000 miles and it is now up to about 125 000 miles but at least its still running barely Now I can understand that once a car gets older that repairs are going to be needed but its getting to the point it is worse than mine and I didnt not_think not_that not_was not_possible You may end up like my boyfriend sinking buck after buck into this car just for things to keep breaking on it and wanting to pull your hair out If you are young and just starting out like the two of us being able to afford cars like these may be a challenge if your luck is as bad as ours It is a nice looking car and a lot could be done to it appearance wise to make it look even better but I really dont not_think not_this not_car not_is not_worth not_the not_trouble not_And not_with not_New not_Jerseys not_stricter not_inspection not_laws not_both not_my not_boyfriend not_and not_I not_are not_most not_likely not_going not_to not_have not_to not_take not_out not_loans not_just not_to not_keep not_our not_cars not_on not_the not_road not_to not_appease not_New not_Jersey not_regulations The glove box has a lot of trouble staying closed especially when going over bumps Forget about the back seat because with any Mustang you really cant not_consider not_it not_a not_backseat not_with not_how not_small not_it not_is not_This not_car not_also not_doesnt not_have not_power not_seats not_or not_tilt not_steering not_so not_when not_I not_drive not_it not_I not_basically not_need not_to not_sit not_on not_a not_phone not_book not_because not_without not_it not_I not_couldnt not_see not_the not_road It would be easy to say well get all the repairs done and you should be fine problem is repairs were done and shortly after more problems came around I know it is an older car and I know it has a lot of miles on it but for the amount of things to break it gets to be too much The handling many many miles ago used to be pretty loose and somewhat stable and then I had more control over the car As time passed and mileage increased the handling became slowly worse to the point that if my hands arent holding the wheel with a tight grip the car doesnt want to stay straight and more and more the steering is getting very tight I honestly never feel sure of myself driving this car anymore The engine in his car is a 4 cylinder with from the specs I saw researching on the web is 90 HP I almost laughed when I found this out At least it beats a Chevy Metro Surprisingly though I was in disbelief on how little it had if im wrong guys correct me because for a four cylinder it was pretty quick off a dead stop From what I understand also is that this car is pretty heavy so I am impressed with this little engine I will say though that the gas mileage hasnt changed that much on the car except in cold weather and it gets about 22 city and about 30 on the highway The car has a very noticeable very rough idle I have sat in that car before for at least fifteen minutes or more and eventually got sick to my stomach because of how much this car shakes Sometimes at forty miles per hour the RPMs seem to stick and the car vibrates a lot if anyone has any idea what that is please let me know my car does that too I will say though when you hit the pedal to the floor it makes a very nice sound I love to hear an engine roar even if it is a four cylinder I can honestly say that I wish he had never got it The amount of money he has spent and still needs to spend on this car is absurd
Neg,To school the grocery store doctors visits and not not_much more Now that im in the purchasers seat im buying a Toyota Camry I have never had a more unreliable costly and problematic vehicle than that Mustang Now I cant not_say not_everyone not_will not_have not_the not_exact not_same not_experience but I recently sold my 92 Ford Mustang after it broke down 9 times in less than 6 months ive sunk well over twice the cost of what the cars worth into repairs If you re a young guy or a mechanic who doesnt mind walking or being without a car in spite of the fact that you own a car then this ones for you However if you dont not_enjoy not_being not_stranded and you require reliable transportation then I would suggest your driving something anything else The cars AC system would have cost over 1 000 to fix after it died out and I didnt not_even not_bother not_to not_check not_what not_the not_problem not_was not_when not_the not_heat not_went not_I not_just not_got not_rid not_of not_it not_To not_hear not_this not_you not_might not_think not_this not_car not_went not_through not_some not_rough not_terrain not_or not_was not_driven not_a not_lot but it wasnt For the record I wasnt not_the not_one not_who not_purchased not_this not_car not_it not_was not_my not_ex not_husbands not_gift not_im not_a not_mother not_of not_two not_little not_kids and we ve been broke down and stranded on the side of the road because of this car time and time again ive had to replace the battery alternator battery connectors correct a short in the electrical system the time belt clutch two tires catalytic converter and something that was wrong with the radiator and exhaust
Neg,They replaced the tailpipe So they filled it up and sent me off They told me it must have just been a bad part A couple weeks later the rusting started again I made ANOTHER appointment and brought the car in Then I started noticing that when I turned the wheel the car kinda made a grinding noise and and this humming noise Oh and by the way that humming and grinding Its starting again a few days ago im not not_saying not_they not_re not_all not_like not_this not_but not_from not_what not_I not_heard not_its not_quite not_common So yet again I took it in and they told me my car had no power steering fluid in it How can they sell a brand new car with no power steering fluid You know I think back to the nasty car I used to drive and I was happy to get rid of it I think if you work really hard you deserve to treat yourself This time when I brought it in I MADE the mechanic get on the ground underneath my car so I could show him the rust I was starting to think I was think I was going crazy Now the newest problem I have is my alignment Which after I took it to the dealership I was told that it will never be right because the body was cut wrong I have no idea what that means If I wanted a family car I would have bought one Shortly after that I joined the military and my car sat at home for six months and wasnt not_driven not_at not_all not_When not_I not_came not_home not_to not_my not_surprise not_what not_was not_there not_more not_of not_RUST not_I not_have not_since not_had not_the not_parts not_replaced not_AGAIN He told me that my car had more rust on it than a five year old mustang he had just worked on Luckily this time they were kind enough to give me a loaner since they kept my car for several weeks I mean I paid for a Mustang and I spent half the time driving a Ford Taurus So at the end of 1999 I bought my mustang I wasnt not_too not_crazy not_about not_the not_new not_body not_style not_at not_first but I grew to like it I do have a few complaints however I owned the car for a month when I started noticing that a rust problem that was beginning on my tail pipe so I made an appointment and brought it in

Neg,Please please please take the car for a long test drive first There is a major lack of power when going up hills My side mirrors have been replaced because the gears that drive them have gone bad My transmission is going already Well I have now had my car for a year and a half and slowly but surely things have started to deteriorate I have had my heat sheild replaced twice Make sure that where you purchase the car they are willing to listen to you when you tell them there is something wrong I am a young woman and a first time car buyer who grew up around cars I have always wanted a true muscle car and when I had the chance to purchase a new 99 Mustang I did For the longest time my brakes would work when they felt like and according to the computer system in my car there is nothing wrong with it I am writing this simply to warn all prospective buyers And last but not not_least search the internet for horror stories on any car you are going to purchase before you do You find out a lot more about a car that way then what the salesmen are willing to tell you It was the car of my dreams Well actually a 67 GT Fast back was but beggars cant not_be not_choosers not_I not_bought not_my not_car not_in not_Canada not_at not_a not_reputable not_dealer not_and not_was not_thrilled not_Not not_long not_after not_I not_moved not_to not_the not_city not_for not_a not_new not_job not_I not_had not_never not_had not_any not_problems not_with not_my not_car not_and not_I not_loved not_it but as luck would have it little things started to happen
Neg,It is a little cramped but much better than most other convertibles The Ford Mustang has really made a great car with there new convertible and witht the hard top The Car has plenty of power along with a great design that will turn heads everywhere However it still looks really great and for kids or adults that act like kids it is a great car It has an electric top which makes it easy to get out in the sun with just a push of a button One of the down sides to the car is that it looks as if the outer molding is very much like thinplastic and woul probably break in an accident One of the best parts about the car is that it has a roomy enough seat to have an average sized adult sit back there especially when the top is down The car has plenty of power to get the wheels spinning and you wont need to bring extra fuel tanks it does pretty well on gas mileage
Neg,The engine and drive train are great The rest of car is the problem On the up side it is a guy magnet The whole driver side of my car is incorrectly installed There are now stains on my seats tools left inside my manual is now under the hand brake console They have replace the rear window and molding And unfortunately it is slightly better than when it went into the dealer So I went to another dealer and he treated me well and I bought the exact same car that is in the picture above Love that red car I had a 95 Hyundai 5 speed and wanted to step up What I really wanted was a 99 Cougar but the salesman was just too much of an idiot to deal with a women buying a car From the dashboard to the door to the outside trim to the interior window molding I have had them rip out my dashboard to find a rattle they cant not_find not_it but we all can hear it They have replaced my hand brake

Neg,I drove a 97 Now the bad part The reintroduction of the 2002 First of all I simple LOVE the dash The rear end bobs and shakes a little but absorbs road imprefections nicely Tbird on a long road trip in the winter of 1997 All switches and latches feel high quality Mechanically speaking the car is a gem This design is basially one that Ford used since 1988 The ride is smooth and quiet Handling is typical for a big car It makes you feel extremely secure when you re in there The guages and controls are easy to read and very logical in design The type I had was a fully equipped V8 LX with every option available The way it curves and wraps around the driver is something that is just amazing In other words stop making cars look like jelly beans give the people FINS and an exhaust that exits through the rear bumper The 225 hp with dual exhaust it puts out are push you in your seat ponies that remind you that you have a V8 The taransmission is a little too conservative in that it forces you to floor it to reach redline in every gear but fuel economy stays nice with that feature The rear wheel drive set up is also a huge plus point FWD cars tend to be more expensive to service and require more services i e cv joints The story on the 2002 woudl have been different if they designed a V8 exculsive to the Tbird and REAL retro styling like metal dashboards with airbags huge white wall tires and sealed beam look HID lighting systems This included leather dual exhaust moonroof JBL audio etc M overall impression of the car was favorable but the sheer size of it makes it undesirable Before I get to that here are the plus points The 4 6L V8 is a modualr engine that is found in other cars i e Mustang so you can be assured that it is a tried and true motor Service for it must also be rather easy to get as are parts Tbird made to look like the 1955 model is simple a horrible attempt to retro a car Using the Lincoln LS which BTW is a import copy stolen Mitsubishi Diamante front end BMW headlights and Acura style front bumper parts and rebadging them is in poor taste I hope this car flops and Ford learns to stop selling amp amp to buyers The first Tbird with this body and the 97 model are light years appart in refinement but it doesnt look to be that way at a glance Alos big American cars tend to look really tachy after they age only a few years I cant not_imagine not_spending not_over not_15 not_K not_on not_this not_thing not_and not_have not_it not_be not_a not_laughing not_stock not_of not_a not_car not_in not_4 not_years not_Acura not_Legend not_coupes not_would not_be not_a not_much not_better not_buy not_even not_though not_they not_are not_FWD not_Ford not_should not_be not_commended not_for not_staying not_committed not_to not_the not_V8 not_RWD not_personal not_coupe but its an idea whose time has come and gone
Neg,The worst part of this 4 speed automatic transmission is its low speed operation Trim lines body styles include the base GL sedan tester and wagon LX sedan and wagon and the SHO sedan performance trim line The fuel tank is 15 gallons so fill ups are kept limited Interior Accommodation i Like many mid sized family cars in the early mid 1990s the Ford Taurus offers less than exciting handling While it has provided flawless transportation for many owners it has created severe headaches for just as many if not not_more owners While the Taurus finds its home on the freeway its cruising abilities still pale in comparison to much of the competition for the 94 model year Its not not_only the reliability issues that has lead me to rate this car at 1 star it is its overall build quality ride and lack of performance It certainly has not not_received not_the not_best not_reliability not_ratings not_the not_ride not_is not_anything not_but not_smooth and despite being relatively cheap in cost the Taurus has never offered an extraordinary value The plastics also used in the cabin are extremely cheap looking Cheap plastics and exposed body metal around the window seals also contribute to this put together with wood and glue theme The base trims come with an OHV 3 0 V6 tester equipped and an OHV 3 8 V6 both producing 140 horsepower and both coupled with an AXOD 4 speed fully automatic transmission The Ford Taurus has survived almost 20 consecutive years since its first year in production thats more than many cars that have come and gone over the last 15 years or so

line SHO trim When the 2nd generation Taurus was first seen in 1992 it was all the rage unfortunately by 1994 these cars were getting quite dated looking In 1996 the futuristic yet ultra odd looking 3rd generation Tauruses arrived making the 2nd generation seem even more dated The handling limits on twisty roads are easily reached making the 94 Taurus GL uninvolving and uninspiring in this department Body lean roll and lack of feel in the steering are the main problems here The General brand P205 65 R 15 all season tires only aggravate the situation On a recent trip from Eureka to San Francisco the 94 Ford Taurus GL sedan provided decent transportation but not not_without not_the not_typical not_problems not_so not_often not_associated not_with not_the not_mysteriously not_popular

not_engines not_and not_3 not_optional not_transmissions The base GL model I drove offered some of the most unrefined highway cruising in a family sedan that had an original MSRP of over 16 000 Engine noise is kept to a minimum even at 75 MPH however wind and roadgrain noise are prevalent throughout the cabin at high and low cruising speeds My tester had an MSRP of 16 000 today the retail cost is about 4 000 I have seen these base modeled Tauruses go for as little as 2 000 with the owners claim that they ran great Reliability has been very poor according to my own research with the 1st and 2nd generation Ford Tauruses The brake pedal felt extremely spongy and I found myself many times flooring the brake pedal just to get this car to stop my Mercury Sable LS had this same problem Fuel Economy is good the EPA rates the 94 Ford Taurus GL 3 0 at 20 29 I observed about 30 MPG overall on my trip from Eureka to San Francisco and back If you are in the market for a used car in the 2 000 4 000 price range I urge you to test drive as many cars as possible Some of my personal favorite cars in this class and price range between 1992 1994 would be the Honda Accord Toyota Camry and the Nissan Maxima Looking for a slightly better built Ford Taurus Check out my review on the a href content 75710631556 2002 Ford Taurus a Happy Car Shopping When driving between 10 20 MPH and punching the throttle the transmission would many times slip completely out of gear revving the engine towards redline only to eventually clunk back into gear when letting off the throttle im not not_new

list and if you live in mountainous areas the 3 8 liter option is probably the way to go This particular engine offers much better hill climbing power VS the OHV 3 0 Braking was also poor Having a front wheel disc rear drum set up without ABS can be more than adequate for many cars however it made for some scary moments going down steep hills in San Francisco with this particular 94 Ford Taurus This particular Taurus has had few major mechanical repairs as of yet however hoses belts brake rotors thermostat struts front turn signal covers and power steering lines had to be replaced in 55 000 miles of use I would also like to note that the car is constantly needing front wheel alignments and I forecast a new transmission is already in demand i Final Thoughts i Like the infamous Hyundai Excel the Ford Taurus has showed us what it is made of over the years Seating is adequately comfortable but the cloth bench seats in the front provide no bolstering whatsoever and the rear bench seats are full bench so they do not not_fold not_down not_for not_added not_storage not_like not_the not_more not_accommodating not_60 not_40 not_split not_variety not_Interior not_room not_and not_cargo are by far the 94 Tauruses strongest assets Unlike the 94 Chevy Lumina there is tons of head and leg room up front and in the rear The Ford Taurus design provides very good use of the space provided also allowing for a very large trunk i Exterior Innovation i The 94 Taurus GL also suffers severely from rattles and sudden jolts when driving over small imperfections in the road The 94 Chevy Lumina and 94 Honda Accord both do a much better job keeping their occupants in a hushed environment when cruising on the freeway back roads or even through town Hills climbing is adequate I could not

bones no amenity options just basic everything no power door locks no power mirrors etc etc Dual front air bags came standard and so did an ashtray Instead of a cassette player that comes standard with most cars in 1994 with a MSRP of 16 000 my tester just came with an AM FM stereo system with 4 speakers A major gripe with the interior of the 94 Taurus is all the exposed screws in the doors handles and in the plastic moldings around the doors and windows one does not not_have not_to not_look not_very not_hard not_to not_find not_these not_exposed not_screws The SHO trim comes standard with a 3 0 DOHC V6 when equipped with the 5 speed manual or a 3 2 DOHC V6 when equipped with the optional new for 94 4 speed automatic Driving Impressions i With only 55 000 miles on the odometer my 94 Ford Taurus GL tester felt like it was on its proverbial last leg Off the line acceleration is adequate with very little wheel spin torque steer however under full throttle the 3 0 OHV Vulcan engine feels and sounds more like an unrefined 4 cylinder than the V6 that it is Despite being somewhat slow it was the transmission behavior that was the killer Under full or even partial throttle the transmission clunks into gear letting the driver know each time it up shifts or down shifts
Neg,The complete opposite of my car It is indeed a comfortable cruiser At low speeds the Taurus can pull U turns and sharp corners easily About a year ago my twin brother bought a 1994 taurus with about 115 K on it for 4000 It is kind of a fake feel by that i mean there is no real feel for the road You can move the wheel with your pinky finger Some people may like that he does but not not_me not_Cornering not_could not_be not_better The car rides pretty smooth and takes the bumps pretty well I have driven this car and I do not not_like not_the not_way not_it not_handles Once you get above 15 or 20 the car sways excessively Bigger tires would help although the 15s are ample STYLING Tauruses are sharp looking although kind of bland They replaced the freeon and it was cold for about a week apparently there was a leak or some type of problem About another 300 to replace that MILEAGE The one thing i didnt not_like is there was no p ower seat so after being used to the one in my car 92 Lumina EURO it seemed kind of flat It does ride pretty smooth though About 3 months after he got it the heater core went out It was a 400 dollar repair Soon after they replaced that the air conditioning wouldnt not_stay not_cold He had the oxygen sensors there are 2 of them in tauruses for about 250 and that made it improve by about 2 or 3 mpg Still not not_very not_good not_only not_about not_200 not_on not_a not_full not_tank not_RIDE not_COMFORT It seemed like a pretty nice car when we test drove it so he bought it and it turned out to be a pretty cool car his looks better because he added a spoiler bra and some chrome wheels His taurus does not not_get not_good not_mileage not_at not_all not_at not_one not_time not_it not_was not_getting not_only not_about not_10 not_in not_the not_city not_Sure not_driving not_with not_a not_lead not_foot was part of the problem but 10 is still TOO low for a car with an engine of that type It has been known to have some trouble but there are many cases of people not not_having not_any not_trouble not_at not_all not_I not_dont not_really not_recomend not_it not_just not_because not_I not_feel not_there not_are not_better not_cars not_in not_the not_early not_90s not_4 not_door not_sedan not_market It is a sharp looking car but he ended up having some problems with it POWER the 3 0L V6 is not not_one not_of not_fords not_best not_engines not_though not_somewhat not_powerful not_in not_lighter not_cars not_it not_seems not_at not_some not_times not_strained not_by not_the not_weight not_and not_size not_of not_the not_massive not_taurus If you like a car that isnt not_very not_sporty not_looking and that blends in with the crowd then they are for you I dont not_reccomend not_this not_car not_Apparently not_other not_tauruses not_have not_been not_known not_to not_have not_transmission not_problems not_that not_are not_very not_costly If you want a similar sized and similar priced car that has been proven to be more reliable and just a better car then i recommend you check out the Chevy lumina just a 92 94 91s had brake trouble Altogether its not not_a not_bad not_car Some like it some dont
Neg,The car however has been very reliable The transmission is always banging into place Just a warning this is a review of the Taurus station wagon not not_the not_sedan It has 120 000 miles on it and has only been in the shop for a new head gasket The car is nice Not amazing but nice Its a good family car good steering but both the braking and acceleration feel unresponsive It has not not_even not_needed not_a not_new not_timing not_belt not_which not_to not_the not_best not_of not_my not_understanding not_is not_expected not_to not_break not_after not_60 not_000 not_miles The brakes have to be pushed pretty far down before they start working and it always feels as if the engine is trying to catch up with my accereleration Furthermore my transmission has started to die
Neg, I knew that it was pretty the moment I saw it on the lot  it was so gorgeous  coming and going  I was proud to drive it  when I drove it  however  I never knew when I was going to get home first month  run sluggish when hot  we live it Houston  Texas  it will always be hot  that is not a good sign  however  frequently it would just not run  it would just suddenly stop second month  tire separation  we are cruising along the freeway  toodling along and the rear tire completely separates  thanks to some Firestones that came on the car  and not only did we get a flat tire  but the tread separation took the rear bumper off  lovely third month  motor mounts and wheel rotors  okay  fine  it was used  it had less than 50K miles on it  maybe that was reasonable  coolant flush  why  smelled funny to the mechanic  coolant smelled burnt  I blamed the service station for trying to pull a fast one  my bad fifth month  over heating  again  called Ford  nope  not their problem  whose problem  do not know  but FORD said not their problem  fine  sixth month  transmission  slipping on corners  great  I know what a V6 is supposed to sound like when cornering under a freeway over pass  this is definite slippage  high RPMs no increased acceleration  solution  new transmission seventh month  hard starting  wonderful  I am loving this car more each day  solution  new battery  this is not my idea of fun  I want to go out into the garage and just get in and go  I do not want to plan ahead each day for when I will need a jump start eighth month  more over heating  mechanic still cant find the problem  I am learning to nurse it by turning off the air conditioner and keep it going so that the breeze would keep the water cool in the radiator  it would limp home ninth month  rotor cap and wires  anything to convince it that it would start in the morning and not burn up batteries tenth month  serious serious money spent on the best truck battery  Interstate  that would definitely turn this car over the radiator eventually cracked  the head gaskets eventually did blow  out of warranty  and the transmission did go out again  all within 110 000 miles  FORD  customer service sucks  I will never ever buy or recommend any FORD ever again the room in the car was unparalleled  the class of arriving in this car was great  It is a pretty car  but sadly the car itself mechanically was horrendous  I am religious about maintenance  about repairs as soon as there is a problem  I have never hated a car before  but I hate this car  
Neg,The AX4N transmission had justed started to slip requiring a rebiuld to fix The rear calipers froze and needed replacing Since the calipers froze it ruined the rotors so they also need replaced The car was a roomy and okay to drive cant not_handle not_corners not_too not_well not_I not_hardly not_can not_believe not_that not_quality not_is not_job not_1 not_at not_Ford We bought our 1994 Taurus in 1999 when it had 52 k mi on it The car was in pretty good shape I traded it in today at 72 k mi The front struts and c v joints are shot and need replaced I also needed to have the engine looked at as the transmission shop informed me that it was giving some engine error codes also In the one years time and 20 k mi we have had the car I have had to replace the water pump serpintine belt thermostat brake pads rotors brake lines and other various suspension parts I traded the car because it needed another 3000 worth of work
Neg,Dear Readers What i like in this vehicle mm what could i say Probably the size to accommodate more friends of mine who dont not_have not_a not_car Three months later i had to change the rear wheel brake rotor caliper and shoes since there was misalignment with the caliper which eventually dug into the rotor disk 4 Now came the REAL BIG headache What can i do now Either replace engine or scrap the vehicle I tried contacting the FORD company but nothing worked out The company which was then offering warranty for Head Gasket leakage didnt not_offer not_the not_warranty not_for not_this not_I not_was not_helpless But after few days of oil change the lamp started to glow again I took it to the dealer then he confirmed my fate that my engine was no good WHAT yes the timing case gasket which is at the lower part of the vehicle has some defects and now the water has started to enter the engine chamber Oh My GOD And now my car stands in my apartment parking garage for no mistake of mine except for that I bought a Ford Vehicle From my perspective except for those people who lease the vehicle or take rentals shouldnt not_go not_for not_this not_when not_there not_are not_cars not_which not_could not_easily not_run not_for not_1 not_3 not_rds not_of not_your not_lifetime My list of hatred started with the problems 1 After just a week of buy i found that the engine bed bolts were weak and i had to change them 2 Two months later it was recalled for tightening the side frame bolts uh i didnt not_know not_what not_it not_was not_and not_what not_the not_dealer not_did not_No not_comments not_and not_details not_from not_the not_dealer not_3 The oil pressure lamp started to glow I didnt not_knew not_what not_exactly not_was not_happening not_Few not_days not_later not_i not_found not_out not_that not_the not_Engine not_coolant not_was not_getting not_dried not_up not_soon not_and not_also not_the not_engine not_was not_heating not_up not_sometimes not_I not_am not_not not_a not_person not_who not_doesnt not_care not_for not_cars not_actually not_i not_luv not_to not_do not_Now not_i not_added not_higher not_viscosity not_oil I think i have to start with a sad note saying never dare to burn yourself buying this vehicle I bought this vehicle in last September I think i must have gone crazy when i bought this I was actually misguided by its look for a 1994 model and the comfort it might offer for its size Later realized its nothing but money eater
Neg,This of course does not not_apply not_to not_Ford not_of not_America Here are things that they dont not_tell not_you and it cost me dearly I own a 1994 Ford Taurus granted I should have done some more research but I didnt In fact when I called they told me there will be no financial help for a deficiency in their part There were even some lawsuits involved and Ford of Canada noted this as a problem and agreed to fix some of those cars The car is a V 6 but sure doesnt act like one its pretty slow getting started but at least the ride is smooth So what was the resolution Lets just say it cost me about 5 month worth of rent I had to have a rebuilt transmission It seems there is a manufacturing problem with certain years of the Taurus Some of the parts are made out of aluminum when it should have been made out of steel My car started to have trouble getting into reverse it was idle there for a bit then literally kick into gear its scary it feels like the car is shaking apart Then it started to do that when I put into drive sometimes it would stall as well I was getting really worried so I go online and start checking my problems It was purchased in 1996 so it was only a couple of years old fairly low miles and I had seen the blitz about how safe the car is Its a family mobile you can even window lock the car so the kids cant not_roll not_down not_the not_windows not_nice not_touch If I had gotten a new transmission I could be in the same boat again it really wasnt not_worth not_the not_time not_or not_the not_effort not_I not_dont not_know not_maybe not_I not_am not_a not_bit not_bitter but I ll never buy Ford again especially for the fact that it is a known problem yet they do nothing about it
Neg,Five months ago the surpentine belt tension froze destroying the pulleys on the water pump and power steering pump Another 400 dollars There are no less than seven recalls for it On the bright side the engine has run completely trouble free I bought my 94 Taurus used in 97 it had 80 000 miles on it After 1 year the transmission refused to enter into any gear And the car is very comfortable on long trips and with 124 000 miles on it still has plenty of power Readers please research your next used car purchase very carefully Brian One month ago the headlight switch wiring harness completely melted leaving me stuck at night with no lights what so ever I recently ran across a recall list for this model year of taurus and was astonished This required 2200 dollars worth of transmission rebuild work Four months later the transmission decides it wants to pick and choose when it will go into Drive Turns out that a valve sticks A little tranny lube solved this problem
Neg,And extremely comfortable But then 1999 came and boom At 120 000 kilometers the head gaskets blew At 100 000 kilometers the air conditioner quit The car is now gone to the scrap yard at 185 000 kilometers The Taurus was a great car when we bought it in 1996 Low mileage everything worked fine This car was a very expensive lesson to learn Ford did rebate the money for the head gaskets Then at 155 000 the transmission had to be completely rebuilt This 1994 Taurus gl was equipped with the 3 8 engine I have learned never to buy a product with the ford 3 8 engine But not not_for not_any not_of not_the not_other not_repairs not_which not_I not_believe not_happenned not_due not_to not_the not_faulty not_ford not_3 not_8 not_engine not_Whatever not_happenned not_to not_cars not_lasting not_10 not_years not_Keep not_in not_mind not_as not_you not_read not_this not_article not_that not_I not_have not_used not_kilometers not_not not_miles not_100 not_000 not_kilometers not_60 not_000 not_miles
Neg,It did great for the first two years After that BOOM Thats when I took it to my local reputable transmission repair shop It would cost 1000 00 to fix or 100 00 for a temporary fix At about 55 000 miles it started overheating and the transmission did not not_want not_to not_shift not_into not_gear The motor shifting around caused a hole in the air conditioning hose resulting in 240 00 worth of repairs Next a freeze plug blew That part went just fine until I realized several months later that the transmission problem caused a broken motor mount Now I had a whole new array of problems The shop says it was such a high price because they would have to remove the motor and all the air conditioning equipment I opted for the temporary fix I came from a Ford family and after driving a sports car for 9 years decided to purchase a 1994 Ford Taurus GL early in 1996 Finally a nice riding car with lots of space Of course it was the one at the back of the motor so out came the motor again for another 1000 Lo and behold upon reinstalling motor the transmission was jerking again resulting in a punctured oil filter im now praying that this car holds over a little longer until I can afford to find another ride
Neg,The ride however is more stiff than the Explorer Id like to see improved First the good That may be good for some bad for others At highway speeds road and wind noise made themselves known As far as emergency maneuvers the Sport Trac performs well too The dash is one of the best ive seen on a Ford The air conditioner did well to cool the cabin in the 85 degree weather These are little observations but they may paint a bigger picture later When I do I ll update this epinion and remove this disclaimer What I have rated so highly is the design behind the truck The protective flip up cap reminds me of the caps on outdoor power outlets In addition you can fold the 60 40 rear seats to accommodate still more cargo The instruments are clearly marked and I especially like the black on white gauges On that note be advised that you should be wary of any first year model Whether or not not_that surpasses the 81 cubic feet total cargo space of the Explorer is unknown to me Ten tie down hooks make sure your cargo is securely held in place On the roof of the cabin Yakima not not_Ford not_roof not_rails offer more space to stow your belongings If you want a lofty ride then the regular Explorer is what you seek not not_the not_Sport not_Trac An available option you might want to consider is a hard tonneau cover that protects your items If so then maybe you should give it a look My trucks cargo cage rattled when I hit bumps and I also noticed some weathered rubber on the seal of the rear window The same effect was revisited for me recently when I first saw the 2001 Ford Explorer Sport Trac Allow me to explain The stereo system I had was the four speaker system which was satisfactory though Id opt for the 6 speaker option myself In addition this is an introductory year and I find it a bit pricey How bout the one that looks like a woman looking in a vanity mirror at one take and then like a skull at the next For these reasons put together i I would not not_recommend not_it not_to not_a not_friend not_of not_mine The cargo bed seems like it can stand up to some good use Ford tested the bed with solid blocks of concrete and not not_a not_scratch was found For now however consider this a short drive review i EXTERIOR 10 I ll let you draw your own conclusions about the way the Sport Trac looks Ever had one of those optical illusion books with pictures that looked like an old lady at one glance and then a young lady looking away at another They can hold 100 pounds of stuff when outfitted with the optional cross members INTERIOR 7 The Sport Trac has many things going for it in this category and things My opinions may not not_speak not_for not_you not_i not_however not_Ask not_yourself not_does not_this not_compromise not_fit not_your not_lifestyle At best all Ford vehicles end up giving you average reliability anyway Food for thought VALUE 6 The Sport Tracs were surprisingly in good numbers when I visited the dealership In closing I think Ford is really onto something here as far as new designs go The Sport Trac is probably the best compromise between an SUV and a pickup There is much to tell so get ready Although the Sport Trac was built on the Explorer frame its dimensions are different its 14 longer than the Explorer and about an inch wider That said I liked the way the Sport Trac rode personally Yes I felt the road more but other qualities were pretty good Engine road and wind noise were all pleasantly muted at city speeds Thats just my problem with the Sport Trac however what you are buying is a compromise Its neither the best pickup nor the best SUV on the market When I asked the dealer about it he said they were selling surprisingly slowly I dont not_expect not_that not_will not_always not_be not_the not_case not_because not_I not_feel not_the not_Sport not_Trac not_will not_become not_immensely not_popular The bed itself is not not_made not_out not_of not_metal but Sheet Molded Composite plastic Supposedly it can withstand 400 pounds of impact per square inch so Ford claims its just as good if not not_better than steel in a car crash In order to compensate for this length increase the Sport Trac was modified to improve lateral rigidity by 40 Essentially what we have here is a Ford Explorer that had its rear chopped off and converted into a pickup bed Right now they re hard to find but availability will be better soon Another nifty feature in the rear cargo bed is a weather proof 12 volt power point for whatever you d want to power up back there camping lights compressors etc You can see how I had a tough time figuring out what to make of the Sport Trac I had originally hoped that the Ford dealership where my friend works would receive a delivery of Sport Tracs soon Alas it was not not_the not_case Id love to agree with them about that but the fact still remains that those changes are all underneath the skin Arent the basic functions of the Sport Trac equal to the previously mentioned pickups anyway Dont they all make the attempt at blending SUV and pickup characteristics As far as the engine however I had to look at my speedometer to know how fast I was going because it gave me little help thats a good thing RELIABILITY 5 The Sport Trac is brand new for 2001 so it has no proven track record The bed itself holds 29 6 cubic feet of cargo which is about 3 cubic feet less than the cargo bay behind the rear seats of a regular Ford Explorer Optional on the Sport Trac is a cargo cage bed extender which increases the bed space by 22 6 additional cubic feet of space The water resistant cloth is all well and good for staying clean but it doesnt feel that great on the skin I also would have liked more lumbar support there was very little Another negative was the abundance of cheap plastic not not_just on the dash but everywhere that is endemic to all Ford vehicles And when you look at the optical illusion that Fords rigged up play the game for yourself is it an SUV or a pickup Ford hopes you ll see something entirely different love at first site AVERAGE SCORE 7 43 out of 10 VARAs PERSONAL RATING 7 5 out of 10 Another clever addition to the dash is an industry first a power operated rear window A dial on the right side of the dash can be tapped for lowering the rear glass by an inch or turned to the left to bring the window down all the way All of these controls were well within reach Looking down I noticed the floor of the Sport Trac is actually rubber not not_carpet In fact there is a full inch more of leg room than the Explorer on which the Sport Trac is based Behind and under the seats there are small cargo compartments for stowing little knick knacks Having stated the positives there were many things I would change about the interior First of all I did not not_find not_the not_bucket not_seats not_on not_my not_truck not_to not_be not_very not_comfortable not_at not_all While driving on an access road an idiot pulled out right in front of me causing me to swerve out of the way just in time After I had recovered my composure I was thankful for the Sport Tracs performance in that situation and was happy to know the soil proof seats would be there for me should a need ever arise again RIDE 8 The Sport Trac handles better than the Ford Explorer SUV no question Who cares where the starting point is SUV vs pickup Remember that this is just my opinion and I m sure others think otherwise All I m saying is that the issue of its an SUV not not_a not_pickup not_is not_all not_a not_matter not_of not_semantics not_these not_important not_differences not_notwithstanding not_By not_the not_way not_the not_Sport not_Trac not_wont not_always not_be not_the not_only not_SUV not_turned not_pickup not_on not_the not_market not_THE not_VERDICT not_AT not_FIRST not_GLANCE not_WHAT not_DO not_YOU not_SEE This is great for keeping the car clean and according to the dealer has a hand in sound insulation Another feature you might find useful is the removable portion of the center console Its actually a soft carrying pack for storing CDs pens papers what have you A final clever feature I noted was a clipboard that flips over for a second cupholder Neat o Moving to the back the rear seats are quite roomy for a pickup You see up until now sport utility vehicles have been a well defined group Many of them are built on pickup truck frames i e the Dodge Durango Nissan Xterra The Ford Explorer Sport Trac is actually a reversal of this trend its a pickup truck that is based on an SUV namely the Ford Explorer For you automobile savvy Epinions members yes you ve stumped me the Explorer was originally based on the Ford Ranger pickup However the Explorer has since become more rigid and heavier than its pickup cousin If you can wait about a year for Ford to iron the kinks out If not not_you might find yourself taking your Sport Trac into the garage for unscheduled maintenance or recalls Ford is not not_exempt not_from not_this not_dilemma not_the not_redesigned not_Mustang not_the not_Ford not_Explorer not_and not_Ford not_Expedition not_all not_had not_numerous not_recalls not_on not_them not_their not_first not_model not_year not_Having not_said not_that not_while not_my not_rating not_of not_5 not_for not_an not_unproven not_car not_may not_seem not_unfair not_and not_could not_be not_wrong not_I not_m not_going not_on not_past not_history not_here not_and not_am not_just not_making not_a not_point So I placed a call at a large Ford dealership in town requesting immediate notification when the first Sport Tracs rolled onto their lot Sure enough my call came and I was at the dealership in no time Note Normally my reviews are based on test drives that take at least a full day Since this was a new model however I could only drive it for about an hour which is actually very generous of the dealer I plan on driving the Sport Trac again once my friends dealership gets some in stock This is something to consider though if a dealer tells you they are selling like hotcakes and uses that as an excuse to jack the price up For a base target price of around 23 000 the Sport Trac comes in a little pricey when compared to other trucks that most closely resemble it The Nissan Frontier 4 door and the Dodge Dakota QuadCab pickups come in 4 000 5 000 cheaper albeit a little more bare Load the Sport Trac to the gills and it tops out at almost 30 000 a sizeable sum indeed Ford argues that because the Sport Trac is actually an SUV with a cargo bed and not not_just not_a not_pickup with four doors slapped on it the sticker is well justified Well When I shut the door getting out I was met with a resounding CLANG and not not_the not_solid not_thud that I appreciate hearing on cars ENGINE 8 The 4 0 L 206 hp 5250 rpm 240 lb ft torque 3750 V6 is the same engine Ford uses in the Ford Explorer Sport and scoots the Sport Trac along quite well I was impressed with the engines highway acceleration which I got to test extensively The Sport Trac is rated to tow 5 000 pounds so the engine is good for light work only HANDLING 8 The Sport Tracs handling is very sure and confident for a truck Taking the car into a large parking lot I swerved it left and right noticing very little pitch Taking turnarounds can be accomplished almost at the speed of passenger cars without squealing the tires
Neg,Three Power Outlets And more Cons Yes this is an odd looking sports utility truck with a rear bed just a little over 4 feet long It comes with a 4 0 liter SOHC V6 Fuel Induction SFI with 205 horsepower and 240 foot pounds of torque There is a 5 year with Unlimited mileage for Corrosion Perforation My Final Thoughts I was really disappointed in this truck When I drove it I was disappointed it road rougher than I expected and it seemed top heavy on cornering The rear seat wasnt not_to not_bad not_there not_was not_enough not_room not_for not_two not_adults not_and not_one not_child not_as not_long not_as not_the not_front not_seats not_were not_not not_all not_the not_way not_back If you want a Ford truck then check out the Ford F 150 it rides and handles a lot better and you can haul more The performance of the V 6 was fair and it run a lot better when we run a premium gas in it The interior looked nice with two front air bags and a nice gauge layout for easy reading The gas mileage rating is 16 MPG for the City and 19 MPG for the highway with a standard 5 Speed Manual with Overdrive transmission The Automatic transmission 5 Speed with Overdrive gets 15 MPG for the City and 19 MPG for the highway One thing I did not not_like is that the engine rattles occasionally using 87 octane so you need to use a higher octane gas Warranty Ford Motor Company gives you 3 years or 36 000 miles Limited Bumper to Bumper and 3 years or 36 000 miles of 24 hr Roadside Assistance The bed is about 2 feet in depth and 4 feet wide by 4 feet in length giving it only about 30 cubic feet in cargo space After awhile you kind of do get use to the look The 2001 Ford Explorer Sport Trac 4WD that are made after 6 22 2000 base list price is for 24580 00 without the destination charge The back seat has three child seat tether anchors I didnt not_test not_the not_air not_conditioner not_Too not_cold not_outside but the heater worked great Standard Equipment Air Conditioning Power Front Disc Brakes and Braking System with F R Anti Lock Four Cup Holders Power Windows and Door Locks A 20 gallon Fuel Tank Oil Pressure Voltmeter and Tachometer Gauges Power Dual Mirrors AM FM Stereo with CD Cassette and Digital Clock Intermittent Wipers If you need an SUV get the Ford Explorer at least you can haul people more comfortably I had this truck for two days playing with it I had the 4 x 4 version with the automatic transmission they also make a 2 wheel drive version I did not not_use not_it not_off not_road not_since not_it not_was not_brand not_new not_and not_not not_mine not_Ford not_makes not_some not_good not_trucks not_I not_was not_just not_not not_impressed not_with not_the not_2001 not_Ford not_Explorer not_Sport not_Trac not_4WD
Neg,The interior is probably my favorite part of the whole vehicle NOTE read this part of the review first then read the update It is a very easy to use CD player radio and the sound quality is excellent for a stock stereo My opinion of this vehicle changed considerably over the year and a half we owned it Thanks The two front seats are incredibly comfortable I suffer from low back problems and these seats have been a god send At the time we purchased ours it was only available with an automatic transmission Ours is Toreador Red and also has the running boards The sound system is very good while ours is only a single CD player you can get a 6 CD changer with one of the other option packages The biggest annoyance to me is that Ford has made it impossible to pick and choose what you want in the options department The automatic transmission seems to shift easily and has the overdrive option which can be turned off and on with the click of a switch There are plenty of cup holders in this particular one as well two up front and two in the back guess person number 5 is out of luck When we asked her who would pay for a blown engine if it happened because the oil hadnt been changed she couldnt answer our question She was rude and when my husband got a little bit huffy with her her response to him was there you go with that attitude again EXCUSE ME It also has a 60 40 split for folding down and makes a very flat surface for carrying things you wouldnt not_want not_on not_the not_seats not_or not_in not_the not_bed The cloth interior vacuums easily and I love the fact that you can take the berber type carpet completely out for thorough cleaning with two furry dogs it will come in very handy The drivers seat has the power adjustments which come in handy since my husband and I dont not_sit not_the not_same not_way not_when not_we not_drive not_and not_we not_can not_change not_it not_quickly Even so it has taken a bit of adjusting for me since im used to driving Honda Civics Braking is a bit soft to me but that also may be due to the difference in the size of the vehicle What annoyed us even more was that they claimed it didnt not_need not_changed not_im not_sorry but oil with 4000 miles of driving time is going to show some wear and its part of the required maintenance at 30 000 miles In addition to the cigarette lighter outlet they have added an extra one something which is becoming more of a standard feature now in most cars but for the true sportsman there is yet another in the bed of the truck for use with various camping sporting equipment All of the other controls are easy to reach too and take a minimum of know how to use with the exception of the windshield wipers I think there are just a few too many notches in the intermitent section just how many different speeds do you really need What ever happened to customer service Apparently Ford doesnt know anything about it Needless to say within two weeks the vehicle was gone we traded it in on a brand new 2002 Honda Accord I will never buy another Ford again and I wont recommend them to my friends It rides very smoothly and from what ive been told if we switch to passenger tires instead of off road tires when we replace them that will improve even more Acceleration is very good passing is a breeze on a flat area and climbing hills isnt not_an not_effort We got in to it with the dealership who couldnt even understand why we were upset so we decided to file a complaint with Ford only to have some snippy customer service rep I use that term loosely tell us that they hadnt done anything wrong The last straw for us was when we took it in for a 30 000 mile check up We are in the habit of having the oil changed in our vehicles every 3000 4000 miles and when we took it in when it was right around 4000 miles THEY DIDnt CHANGE THE OIL The rear seat is very roomy one of my pet peeves with most of the popular SUVs is the knees up the nose scenario for anyone with long legs sitting in the back I can easily sit in the back seat im 5 7 mostly legs facing forward and not not_have not_my not_knees not_even not_touch not_the not_seat not_in not_front not_of not_me When my husband and I were starting our search for a new vehicle we had several issues we needed to address First and foremost we wanted a 4 door vehicle Second we needed something with a decent cargo area because of my husbands sales job Everything was steering us towards a mini van until we spotted a Ford Sport Trac it was love at first sight While the bed is smaller than most pick ups it is generally large enough to hold most things an average family needs to haul and with the cargo cage it adds quite a bit of space to it We used ours to help friends move and got an amazing amount of stuff in the back as well as in the rear seat with it folded down They dont not_know not_a not_thing not_about not_craftsmanship not_or not_customer not_service and for that kind of money I think I should at least get one or the other in this instance I got neither I dont not_make not_a not_habit not_of not_getting not_rid not_of not_vehicles not_this not_quickly but I could see this was one that would be going nowhere literally as well as figuratively fast One big plus with the cargo cage is when its flipped into the bed it makes a nice secured space for hauling smaller items so they dont not_slide not_all not_over not_the not_bed not_My not_only not_concern not_with not_this not_bed is that its made out of this mysterious composite material I am hoping it holds up with the elements and use Okay on to the things I dont not_like Because we bought a demo we got a nice chunk of cash knocked off the price but since it was under a certain mileage amount it still classified as a new vehicle Driving the Sport Trac is a very pleasant experience while it doesnt drive like any car ive driven it also doesnt drive like a truck either somewhere in between Handling is very responsive with a minimal roll on corners There is also this neat little cargo compartment between the seats that is removable if you need to carry something valuable with you Interior noise is a little more than I would like but nothing you cant not_drown not_out not_with not_the not_stereo ive noticed quite a bit of wind noise around the windows not not_sure if its because the windows dont not_seal not_as not_tightly not_as not_they not_should or an aerodynamic design flaw With two speakers in the front and two speakers in the back you can enjoy anything from a Strauss waltz to Metallica without having to change a lot of settings for maximum sound quality I do wish they had included a cassette with this package for some of us who dont not_have not_everything not_on not_CD apparently they have since changed this Exterior is actually very simple not not_a not_lot of flash or trim and washes up very easily One major plus though is the rear sliding window it can be opened several inches with the touch of a button or put down the whole way Even opened just a few inches creates air circulation sufficient to cool it off on a hot day and it keeps the noise to a minimum far better than driving with the driver or passenger window cracked ive never been a big fan of cruise control but this one is very easy to use and operates very efficiently In the year and a half we owned it we had 3 recalls had to have the wheel bearings repacked something ive never had to have done on ANY other vehicle ive ever owned and then to top it off had problems with it not not_wanting not_to not_start not_I not_dont not_enjoy not_being not_stranded not_someplace so I had it looked in to only to find that the idle sensor had to be replaced If you want one thing you generally end up

not_this not_is not_a not_great not_idea but for the money conscious consumer it isnt We test drove one at a local dealership and got all the specifics on it Originally we were going to order one but held off and our patience paid off when we came across a dealer demo that had all of the options we wanted and a few we could have cared less about We purchased the Sport Trac at the beginning of July and already we have over 7000 miles on it The model we purchased is a two wheel drive with the limited slip axle 6 Cyl cloth interior and the option packages that include the leather steering wheel

apparently this issue is being addressed with SUVs in general by the government so hopefully future SUV purchasers will fair better A tip for any potential buyers thinking of ordering if you are considering the Estate Green PLEASE go to a dealership and ask to see another vehicle painted in this color Apparently the guy setting up the color charts is color blind the real shade looks NOTHING

Neg,Also the fan switch for the climate control has quit The body has held up well just recently falling victim to surface rust and that sin a harsh New England Climate To purchase one now would be risky I would recommend searching long and hard for a perfect model It has a leak in the rear somewhere according to Ford that causes some havoc on the electrical system every now and then Some other items have died early on such as the A C Unit has not not_worked not_in not_a not_while and looks to cost over 800 to repair This should be a normal relay but everyone I consult as well as my manuals say I need Climate Control parts because it has a high tech system However it does not not_have not_Automatic not_Climate not_Control not_to not_my not_knowledge As a new vehicle this was a grand choice I have the V 6 LX Model which is by far a more well rounded vehicle than the Turbo GT Model I have found the reliability to be greater than the Turbo as well However all cars age and the Probe has done better than most other American cars ive experienced but holds no match to a foreign make Normal wear items like both CV Joints have failed as well as the car now eats literally brake pads
Neg,Then the warranty ended and the problems began Its funny as I read the reviews for the Ford Windstar it sounded just like my exact thoughts I had when I first bought the van I loved my 96 Windstar for the safety features strong engine low insurance costs roominess and ride The cruise control worked only when it wanted the upper subframe mount broke the ABS light came on electrical short the automatic locking feature would lock every few minutes the one feature that I have come to hate even when working properly and lastly and most expensive the head gasket blew at 65 000 miles 2500 00 Ford has had many problems with the head gasket on the 3 8 V 6 in fact they have extended the warranty on 95s to 100 000 miles to cover the problem but I have a 96 and that doesnt count in Fords eyes Calling Ford customer service 1 800 392 3673 is useless sorry sir your file on this matter is closed im filing a complaint with the NHTSA and I am writing a letter to Ford for reimbursement Lastly I would like to break down the overall rating at the end of this review 4 the first two years of ownership 1 for the reliability and customer service dealership and Ford hotline and for after the warranty period
Neg,We took out 60 000 extended warranty When you are expired you re expired At 60 200 miles the transmission went and the engine gasket went They fixed it but the car was in the shop for 5 days Two months later I turned on the HEAT and guess what Only Defrost worked His assistant called me and she said the exact same thing that the 800 man said They said the vents and passage ways for the heat were defective and needed replaced Another 5 days in the shop All sent smoothly except by now we discovered that not not_one roof top shell type luggage carrier fit a Windstar Ford will sell a 70 canvas water RESISTANT tent type thing The re built transmission cost us over 1000 and they said since it was close to the warranty mileage the DEALER would give us a little off the bill Luckily by now the gasket was a re call why was I not not_surprised not_I not_took not_the not_car not_home not_1000 not_poorer and that week end discovered that my brakes failed We had a 90 Caravan and test drove the first Windstar that came out We loved the ride and quiet so we bought one Big Mistake Picked up the car and two weeks later it was in the shop for 5 days to repair the A C I turned on the a c and the fan blew all the vents shut The Dealer and CEO assistant said that they used to help people when it was close to the warranty mileage but the stockholders didnt not_get not_much not_money not_then and they do now with this new policy I told her that it was interesting what she said and ironic because we were leaving to go pick up our brand new Dodge Grand Caravan Ps 27000 miles later our Caravan has NEVER been in the shop When we bought this Windstar Ford advertised that it had more room inside than a Grand Caravan After we bought it I checked out that statement and found it was false I called Ford 800 to see if they d help with the 1000 bill on the transmission and the man laughed at me I mean laughed out loud that I thought they d help Lady when you re expired you re expired Even if you were only 2 miles over we wouldnt not_help not_I not_was not_furious not_I not_wrote not_to not_the not_CEO not_of not_Ford not_with not_a not_copy not_to not_Consumers not_Reports not_I not_told not_him not_the not_whole not_story not_and not_asked not_for not_help
Neg,It was strange We brought it to the dealer for repair and got the surprise No the car was not not_pregnant not_we not_needed not_a not_whole not_new not_transmission not_on not_a not_year not_old not_car The car would not not_go not_in not_to not_third not_gear not_staying not_in not_2nd not_instead not_of not_drive not_or not_over not_drive In the mechanics ramblings we learned that he had to do this kind of work a lot on the ford minivan line While the comfort of the van was luxurious the hassle of having to get a major repair so soon after receiving the car was too much of an event to convince me to lease another ford The warranty of course covered the repair but I have to assume that this can happen again the new transmission can from the same people who made the year old one I return the van in three months and I think I ll get a fuel efficient sports car The Ford Windstar has both good points as well as bad We were sold on how comfortable the car was to drive and ride in I also have to haul equipment around in it so the room was also a plus About one year after we had the van we experienced out first trouble
Neg,No wonder y all are having such troubles We now own a 1998 Toyota Sienna and are very thankful for it NEVER AGAIN FORD In less than two weeks I am driving down a very busy highway and my engine self destructs This is not not_the not_van not_that not_I not_thought not_I not_was not_buying not_Never not_again not_Ford not_Never not_again not_Updated not_information Yes within two weeks of getting the van back with the new engine the transmission falls out That sucker is GONE The ride and glide of this van was great even though the gas mileage was not not_at not_all not_what not_we not_had not_hoped not_for not_I not_wanted not_this not_van not_because not_I not_wanted not_to not_keep not_my not_children not_safe Now we have to have a whole new engine the 1 000 for the head gasket repair is down the tubes and we have to shell out 20 of the cost for the new engine which is in fact a remanufactured engine We bought our 1996 Ford Windstar minivan used in May of 1998 with about 25 000 miles on it We immediately noticed little things that were annoyances but felt like we could live with it cup holders which immediately broke rear motor on vent window no longer working chair arms breaking It replaced a 1991 Ford Taurus station wagon which had had numerous problems all of which we attributed to Ford just having a bad year All was well until right at 60 000 miles the head gasket blew Because we were not not_under not_warranty we took it to a local reputable repair shop and paid 1 000 for the repair And on top of that they have NO idea how long it will take to get it in because there is such a high demand for these engines right now because there are so many people having the same problem as I have had I am thankful that Ford is only going to charge us 20 of the cost and I am thankful that they are giving us a 100 000 mile powertrain warranty which will be backdated to the time that we actually bought the van However after this has happened and we have read countless reviews of this happening to others not not_to not_mention not_the not_transmission not_troubles not_and not_timing not_gasket not_troubles not_we not_apparently not_have not_to not_look not_forward not_to not_I not_go not_back not_to not_my not_original not_intent not_in not_buying not_this not_van not_to not_keep not_my not_children not_safe
Neg,Two front end alignment problems three gasgets on the engine Two of the three I have had problems with Ford has earned its reputation Fix or repair daily I will never buy a Ford Windstar again Mine has been in the shop nine times for transmission work or front end work As for the transmission it shifts hard going into second gear Ford told me this is normal on the Windstar Every time I took the van in they would do minor adjustments and give it back to me with the van still shifting hard A month after the warranty went out the transmission went out completely It took me threatening to take them to court before they finally fixed the transmission I have four friends who have bought Windstars and three of them are having the same problem with their transmission I am also having problems with the front end I have been talking to a man that works on vehicles and he has informed me that the Windstar has three problems One Transmissions
Neg,At 80 000 miles my van started showing the classic symptoms of pending head gasket failure I loved driving this van I would probably still be driving it if Ford was a responsible and reputable company Of my friends and family members who drive drove Ford vehicles with 3 8 liter engines the following can sum up the experience co worker on his 4th engine and 2nd transmission in law on her 2nd engine and 3rd transmission cousin on 2nd engine also had 2000 damage repair from defective subframe failure My dealer service manager discovered the problem but could offer me no financial assistance even though he agreed the failure was premature and identical to the problem on various 94 95 model vehicles for which Ford had issued extended 100 coverage warranties I spoke with the district office as well as the main customer service office in Detroit to no avail Ford d only answer was that if I could show where assistance had been provided to other owners of 96 or later vehicles in a similar circumstance they would try to offer assistance I got rid of the vehicle before the failure occurred Avoid any Ford vehicle with a 3 8 liter engine Also Ford has a continuing problem with faulty defective transmissions
Neg,The dumb thing wouldnt not_start On top of a ton of other problems We have had so many problems with this van it isnt not_funny We had a check engine light coming on that was a cylinder 4 misfire code So I had it Towed to the mechanic and he said that he suspected a seized engine but will let me know tomarrow The next day I was going to drive it back up and leave it with the mechanic and when I turned the key I heard a huge clunking scraping sort of sound and then nothing The oil light went off and was fine for about 2 minutes and then the check engine light came on with a cylinder 4 misfire code I drove it home and parked it for the night The head gasket blew and was fixed before we got it thank goodness but who cares really with all the other problems we have had what difference would one more problem make It NEVER seems to run out of things to go wrong I would DEFINATLY NOT recommend a Windstar unless you just like spending time and money at your mechanic for ENDLESS repairs updated to say that the engine IS locked I am hardly suprised I took it as a bad sign when we were looking to sell our van and 75 of them had either a new or rebuilt engine on it We took it in had the spark plugs wires complete tune up and it didnt not_fix not_the not_problem not_I not_took not_it not_to not_ford and they said that it was a head gasket problem I decided to get a second opinion because we were not not_having not_any not_other not_symptoms not_of not_head not_gasket not_problems and the guy i took it to said that we didnt not_have not_the not_problem not_like not_Ford not_had not_told not_me and suggested a few other things We first tried the coil pack and it didnt not_fix not_it so we replaced the computer and it corrected the problem completly I drove it about 500 miles and the oil light started coming on flickering on and off I stopped immediatly and checked the oil and it was not not_low not_I not_went not_straight not_to not_the not_mechanic and he said that he thought the oil pan screen might be clogged another 400 repair and suggested I change the oil to a heavier weight to see if it could help first
Neg,It takes Ford 8 11 weeks to replace faulty engines Center for Autosafety in Wash D C is considering further action against Ford on behalf of 96 and later year Windstar owners Stay away from Windstars Ford sets up extended warranty program costing ford 200 million dollar in response to class action lawsuit covering faulty engines in 94 95 Windstars Ford has since extended this program to cover additional models that have 3 8L V6 engine tauruses sables mustangs 2 million Ford vehicles are covered but not not_96 Windstars Ford gives horrible customer support Replacement engine blocks are in high demand and on back order
Neg,My qualms about the two door Now four door or two door It makes driving enjoyable when everyone riding in the car is comfortable and happy The difference in price is certainly one factor but let us look at the other factors Alright so you re interested in buying a sport utility vehicle Time to look around The Ford Explorer a great car Size is not not_too not_big not_and not_not not_too not_small not_Huge not_trunk not_size not_Design not_is not_flawless not_especially not_the not_1996 not_model The back seat passangers have very little room Its really no bigger than a regular car and gets ten times worse gas millege Basically two door cars are just a big pain to deal with from my standpoint Pay the extra cash for the four door Its easier nicer and just overall more convenient If you are shopping around for sport utilities also consider the Toyota 4 Runner my personal pick the Niessan Pathfinder and for a smaller variety the Honda CRV which in actuality is not not_small not_by not_any not_means not_I not_test not_drove not_one not_a not_few not_months not_ago not_and not_was not_extremely not_impressed not_with not_not not_only not_the not_size not_but not_also not_all not_of not_the not_special not_features not_that not_come not_even not_on not_some not_of not_the not_most not_stripped not_down not_models not_Happy not_shopping not_and not_drive not_safely
Neg,The purchasing experience The auto transmission is slow What I dont not_like Thanks for reading Suzi It is not not_fun not_to not_drive This is a safe reliable vehicle for most people The dashboard appeared to be made of plastic The ignition is illuminated which is a nice feature The mileage for this car is excellent at 30 38 It was poorly constructed and frankly looked cheap The seats are simply not not_comfortable not_as not_they not_are not_very not_hard The Ford Escort is a 4 cylinder of course with a 1 9 liter engine The motorized seatbelts are a hassle and the car is very noisy to drive Obviously others love this car but for me I give it a two stars well okay two and a half stars The vehicle turned corners well and I liked the compactness of the car and the ease in

paid for Ford Escort after about a year What I didnt not_enjoy not_about not_the not_Escort is it has almost no get up and go It is powerless What I enjoyed about the car Other than the airbags for short or small people see below the car is very safe The sales personnel were pretty nice and were helpful I decided to pay cash for this car and obtained a three year 36 000 mile warranty It is

not_cassette This car had absolutely no repairs required in the period of time I owned it I really appreciated the reliability and dependability all around driving was fine Here are the features and availability from the Ford website Anti lock brakes not not_available Driver and passenger side airbags are standard air conditioning is optional alloy wheels optional cassette optional cruise control is optional As noted these airbags were the first out there so could cause serious injury or death if they were deployed during a slow speed crash I read this in a few website locations The seats are hard and terrible for someone with back problems I did not not_enjoy not_this not_car not_other not_than not_the not_cuteness not_factor but it is reasonably priced inexpensive to maintain minimal repair problems If you decide to purchase this vehicle be sure to check out the airbag situation as it could mean the life of you your child or a small person riding in the vehicle Here are some of the dimensions for the car noted on the website Cargo capacity 17 cu Front head room 38 Rear head room 38 Front leg room 42 Rear leg room 35 Exterior Length 170 Width 67 Height 53 Curb weight 2353 Wheelbase 98 Fuel tank capacity 11 9 gallon So what happened with this car Even though this car was completely paid for I couldnt wait to get rid of it due to safety concerns not not_overall but due to the airbag problem for small or short people me comfort concerns enjoyment in driving etc The drivers side air bag in the 1995 model that I owned was one of the first air bags that came out This meant that in a slow speed crash it would deploy and anyone child or short adult under 5 7 or so could die This made me nervous whenever I drove the car because I am 5 3 If I am going to die in a car

someone you care about Why did I purchase a Ford Escort My previous vehicle had seen its last days I meandered over to the local Ford dealership While I wanted a car I could depend on I was also seeking safety and reliability and wanted a vehicle which was also appealing to the eye I thought the Ford Escort was really cute and it was reasonably priced around 12 000 at that time If you are not not_short not_like not_me and want an inexpensive simple basic economy car I would think the car is acceptable I now have a Saturn SC2 the sporty model and love it I feel safer in it it looks sharp it is fun to drive has all the bells and whistles dings can usually be rubbed out so the insurance is less expensive Final wrap up
Neg,Real life comments on usability on our 1995 Ford Escort Wagon We picked the Ford Escort over the Subaru for a few reasons but mostly cost and fuel economy Right now and until the kids are 7 10 I think it would be fine The Subaru has become a sport utility and the cost has shot up while the fuel economy went down We have not not_been not_disappointed not_The not_Escort not_gets not_good not_mileage not_mid not_20s not_in not_the not_city not_and not_29 not_30 not_mpg not_on not_the not_highway not_With not_a not_stick not_its not_zippy not_and not_responsive My concern is how the car will age will I see lots of this in the next 20 30 000 miles I ll keep you posted Andr We sold our Toyota PU for a family car because we were expecting a child and needed to be able to have a child car seat in it We also are a one car family Going from the pick up which had good mileage and hauling capacity we wanted a station wagon We feel safe in it Ours we picked up used 45 K for 5 500 in 1998 when it was almost 4 years old We bought from an owner directly But as I looked in used car lots I saw alot of similar cars in the 6 500 7 000 range and didnt not_have not_as not_nice not_packages not_automatic not_no not_AC not_etc The other downer is that the car sometimes sounds a bit tinny this is kind of unfounded but my worry it that it wont hold up over time I mean will I be able to put 200 000 miles on this car or will things start to break A few insignificant things are starting to show wear at 56 000 miles So I think we got a good deal Plus all we ve had to do to it is regular maintenance Good things about it are some of the features like the stock radio is nice having a tach and nice dashboard layout Its got several dome lights and has power rear view mirrors that make it easy for adjusting Its also got a tiny insignificant feature I like a little arrow by the fuel gage that tells you what side of the car the fule lid is on The front seats work nice and the back has a split 1 3rd 2 3rd seat for loading Bad things about it are that the car is a bit small im 5 10 210 pounds sometimes I bonk my head but I dont not_feel not_cramped not_once not_settled not_in And while the car seat for the kiddo works my back does get a big tweaked from time to time and shes had her head bonked a few times as well im not not_sure this car would work as the only car for a family with two teenagers
Neg,It is not not_particularly not_roomy It has little pick up But it gets you from here to there The 95 Ford Escort Wagon LX strikes me as that kind of car But it has four wheels and will get you from here to there It has been a fairly dependable car although squeaks and rattles showed up almost immediately Remember back in the 70s when grocery stores came out the generic canned goods The ride is rougher than I like Road noise is pretty loud In fact the entire Escort line strikes me that way Its a CAR Nothing fancy certainly nothing very desirable But if you re looking for anything with pick up style room or comfort and quiet then the Escort is not not_for not_you They were quite popular and then were made fun of I remember seeing an automobile painted in the familiar blue and white generic color with the word CAR painted on the side For the first year I had that car in the shop quite often trying to nail down noises that I felt shouldnt not_have not_been not_there not_Still not_it not_has not_performed not_reasonably not_well not_if not_not not_exceptionally If you are someone who doesnt particularly care what kind of car you drive just need transportation or dont not_have not_a not_lot not_of not_money not_than not_this not_isnt not_such not_a not_bad not_car not_to not_own
Neg,We leased the vehicle based on a 24 900 base price Fine I ll just go buy something bigger and nicer You get to know your service department personnel by name The third row seat is made for munchkins Seriously Very minimal leg room back there As we soon found out with eye catchers reality sometimes gets tossed out the window We had a Ford Windstar that was nothing but problems so I was hesitant to buy anymore Ford products So then you say Oh That must be to make up for the cargo room behind the third seat right Wrong again When we went to trade it in 16 months later the best trade in we got was 16 500 We owned the vehicle for approximately 16 months and had approximately 800 in repairs over 4 separate incidents Good thing I purchased an extended warranty 5 Problem DEPRECIATION Our family rides much more comfortably now If you still decide you want one of these monsters I highly recommend an extended warranty Good luck on your new purchase Thats what I told the Toyota salesman a year and a half ago when we couldnt strike even close to the deal we wanted on a Sienna minivan We struck a lease deal and soon headed out on a long road trip that very evening Thats when I soon realized what I had done 1 Problem Gas Mileage To sum it up I was more disappointed with this 40 000 vehicle than I was pleased im very glad to be the owner of a new 2003 Toyota Sienna On the highway with cruise control on 65 and no major hills you can get a whopping 19 MPG Keep in mind im a Republican but even those kinds of gas mileage upset me and my pocketbook 2 Problem Control However with a bad experience at a bad Toyota dealership we went back to the local Ford lot to look I dont not_think not_all not_Toyota not_dealerships not_are not_bad not_you not_can not_see not_my not_review not_on not_my not_new not_2003 not_Toyota not_Sienna We have to sit our folded stroller vertically to make it fit and then you sort of have to slam the door to get the stroller to push against the back seat so the door will close Big disappointment 4 Problem The salesman recommended that we look at SUVs as opposed to minivans since they tend to hold far better value than minivans Majestically sitting on the front row was a good looking 1999 Ford Expedition Eddie Bauer Edition I ll have to admit these vehicles are eye catchers The vehicle handles very awkwardly in curves and in situations requiring quick response I often found myself trying to overcompensate for bad timing in curves 3 Problem Cabin Design Folks this is one of the biggest vehicles on the road therefore there must be plenty of leg room and cargo space right WRONG And that was a high offer from the dealership we bought it from because they knew the vehicle and had serviced it many times im really glad I didnt not_pay not_the not_new not_sticker not_price not_of not_40 not_000 not_plus not_Just not_so not_you not_dont not_think not_im not_solely not_a not_complainer not_I not_will not_share not_with not_you not_some not_of not_the not_good not_things not_1 not_Beautiful not_exterior not_with not_nice not_paint not_Definitely not_one not_of not_the not_best not_looking not_vehicles not_on not_the not_road not_2 not_5 not_4L not_V8 not_Triton not_Engine not_has not_lots not_of not_power and can handle any load you put on it Definitely would be great to pull campers with 3 Leather seats are tough and durable even with small kids 4 Probably the best factory sound system ive ever heard Beats most aftermarket stuff 5 Climate control and rear air make the cabin comfortable for all passengers
Neg,We bought a 1999 Ford Expedition The 4x4 was a VERY bumpy ride and it sits so high I could barely get into the truck We have loved the size we did get the third seat and it works well for children BUT the truck is extremely bumpy compared to our old jeep and other SUVs There is also a recall coming up about the windshield wipers they go off all the time I do not not_think not_we not_will not_get not_another not_Expedition not_when not_out not_lease not_is not_up We had previously had a 1993 Jeep Cherrokee and it turned out to be quite the lemon I did my research and used Autobytel to purchase the car I do think that by using this service we saved several thousand dollars After looking at all the different Expeditions and driving the 4x4 we decided on the Eddie Bauer edition
Neg,You will see how often they see a shop The expedition does have room though the seats were not not_really not_comfortable So if you have been brainwashed from child birth to purchase ford motor products flame on If you are smart and do enough research Also note friends dont not_let not_friends not_drive not_fords not_see not_also not_www not_consmer not_reports not_com not_ford not_recalls not_dont not_say not_i not_didnt not_warn not_you i recently got an oppertunity to drive an expedition in Dallas Tx i will admit it does have a good look but its made by ford I will also admit i have been a chevy man since i was a kid And it does have plenty of cup holders this truck is good for that mom or school teacher who likes to run a rat pack of kids to their soccer or basketball game Its loaded with options decent stereo with cd changer when i got the expedition on the freeway i was not not_impressed not_with not_the not_acceleration It seemed to take off as if though it was a six cylinder Now from my understanding these things come with a v8 which i believe is a 4 9 litre engine Compared to chevys 5 7 litre i know there is no contest here I also noticed they have beenm recalled for tires falling off brake mastercyliders failing and sorry gas milage I wouldnt not_own not_one not_even not_if not_they not_gave not_it not_to not_me not_Remeber not_the not_four not_dangeruos not_words not_kids not_Ford not_stands not_for not_fixed not_or not_repaired not_daily
Neg,Of course my biggest pet peeve is mpg As usual I have experienced another SUV and grown to hate it I recommend buying any car that will not not_waste not_fuel not_and not_kill not_passengers not_of not_other not_cars not_you not_may not_collide not_with This car gets a ridiculously low mpg of nearly 10 in the city I think it would be more environmentally sound to clear cut ten acres of rain forest then drive an Expedition around for ten years I have expressed my dislike of SUVs in many of my earlier reviews but as long as my relatives continue to buy them I will continue to write of my displeasure when driving them Fords Expedition is now sadly a mid size SUV despite the fact that it in itsself is a monstrosity The car with its massive size offers an unwanted guarantee that it will kill the passengers of any car you come into collision with My closest friends husband died in a collision with an explorer a smaller car and the child driving the Explorer is still emotionally wounded However it still is ridiculously flimsy and suffered 2500 of damage once in a five mph collision with a garage door
Neg,My mother has one of these monstrocities and I drove it for the first time a few weeks ago It was definately powerful and the power steering was very responsive but I couldnt stop worrying about hitting the car next to me or the curb In short if you are a very experienced driver and want luxury in an SUV buy this vehicle if you re even the slightest bit nervous about driving get something smaller It was the most nerve racking experience of my life Going from my small Toyota Camry to the Ford Expedition reminded me of the mock suv the Canyonero from tvs The Simpsons you remember the theme song fifty yards long and two lanes wide its fifty tons of American pride I love all the features on it led showing miles to empty or miles per gallon six disc cd player auto climate control blinkers in the side mirrors and room for seven comfortably
Neg,The parking brake constantly dug into my shin I used to drive a 88 Full Size Bronco Eddie Bauer I then took some vacation time in Colorado and decided to rent the Expedition Compared to the Bronco I HATED the expedition Its a larger truck but inside it doesnt feel like it AT ALL If you want luxury buy a bmw if you want a truck dont not_expect not_it not_to not_look not_and not_feel not_like not_car not_Although not_I not_must not_say not_my not_88 not_bronco not_was not_able not_to not_outhandle not_my not_friends not_97 not_VW not_Golf not_on not_dry not_roads not_which not_I not_proved not_when not_I not_wound not_up not_pulling not_him not_out not_of not_the not_ditch It didnt not_handle not_NEARLY not_as not_well not_as not_the not_Bronco not_did not_but not_thats not_not not_surprising not_being not_that not_it not_IS not_a not_larger not_vehicle not_I not_even not_wound not_up not_sleeping not_in not_the not_vehicle not_one not_night not_and not_found not_it not_quite not_frustrating not_that not_1 not_the not_seats not_dont not_recline not_enough not_to not_sleep not_in not_very not_well not_and not_2 not_with not_the not_design not_of not_the not_rear not_seats not_there not_is not_no not_comfertable not_way not_to not_sleep not_in not_the not_back not_Its not_also not_too not_luxurious not_I not_cant not_stand not_what not_car not_companies not_are not_doing not_to not_these not_trucks
Neg,We both like the look of the Expedition and the fact that it has the third seat The interior is well designed and comfortable but the positive aspects of the vehicle are mostly aesthetic The truck feels narrow and pigeon toed while driving rendering it a poor handling truck We were reluctant to reject this vehicle because until you drive it its great After many years of driving a 3 door minivan with three kids my husband and I decided go for something more practical We got to the dealership and we gung ho and ready to buy I took it for a spin while my husband conversed with the salesman upon my return and to the dismay of the salesman I told my husband no way After he drove the Expedition he also agreed The suspension feels too bouncy making the truck feel as though it were all over the road so to speak especially over bumps I drove the truck for about 45 minutes and my husband the same so in total we drove for an hour and a half and were unfortunately not not_at not_all not_impressed
Neg,I was not not_in not_the not_market not_for not_a not_new not_vehicle but my son was He asked that I go with to look at the Ford Expedition It didnt not_take not_long not_for not_him not_to not_realize not_he not_could not_not not_afford not_it not_However not_while not_looking not_with not_him not_I not_fell not_in not_love not_with not_the not_Expedition not_Eddie not_Bauer not_Edition not_of not_course not_and not_behind not_my not_sons not_back not_went not_and not_purchased not_one not_Sitting not_behind not_the not_wheel not_of not_this not_humongous not_vehicle not_makes not_me not_feel not_like not_the not_Queen not_of not_the not_Road The smell of the leather all the modern conveniences the sense of power one gets from controlling this huge animal and all the envious glares from on lookers makes one feel on top of the world However I soon learned that the cost of the vehicle as high as it is would only be a fraction of what it would cost to drive and maintain this animal Unless you have money to burn and a smaller vehicle for your everyday running around I do not not_recommend not_this not_vehicle not_After not_putting not_only not_6 not_000 not_miles not_on not_mine not_I not_was not_fortunate not_to not_sell not_it not_just not_as not_gas not_prices not_began not_to not_soar not_I not_am not_now not_happily not_in not_a not_28 not_33 not_mpg not_small not_car
Neg,Update 4 3 2002 At night headlights were fairly bright both high and low Workmanship Quality It appeared that the car was very well put together On the other hand this car also felt quite flimsy in many aspects From the seat it was easy to operate the controls Of course there is the option of buying Japanese or Volkswagen but for a price The exterior of the Focus has often been described as love it or hate it styling It took me a bit to get used to the driving position but the seat was decent The seatback had a 60 40 split fold down feature which was easy to use from the trunk The sticker revealed that this vehicle was a stripped down base model equipped with only automatic transmission and A C as options It seems that Ford strove to put the quality feel of a sophisticated European car into an inexpensive American built car and it succeeded Too often I would find myself stuck behind a less nimble car such as Kia Sephia struggling just to maintain the recommended curve speed While driving I found the visibility to be so so the view to the rear felt somewhat limited and the outside mirrors were smallish At least the manual mirrors were very easy to adjust precisely in other cars manual mirrors tend to be too sensitive and finicky to adjust precisely On the other hand I was not not_as not_happy not_with not_the not_powertrain not_while not_the not_2 not_0 not_liter not_SPI not_engine not_carried not_over not_from not_the not_Escort not_was not_adequate not_the not_4 not_speed not_automatic not_transmission not_was not_quite not_slushy not_and not_hesitant By contrast the ZX3 hatchback reviewed by others here inherited the more sophisticated Contour powertrain including the more powerful Zetec engine in the future I should drive a ZX3 for comparison The base price was in the ballpark of 12 500 and the particular vehicle I rented after destination charge was 14 400 MSRP I think this is a bit too expensive I am downgrading this car to 3 stars and will not not_recommend not_this not_car not_any not_longer not_I not_have not_learned not_that not_there not_are not_four not_simultaneous not_government not_safety not_probes not_launched not_on not_this not_model not_regarding not_such not_items not_as not_unintended not_airbag not_inflation not_engine not_fires not_and not_bad not_rear not_wheel not_bearings The instrument cluster was more conventional and it was extremely easy to read its legible letters bright warning lights and green backlighting bore a family resemblance to the boring yet legible instrument cluster in my Contour Sadly there was no tachometer in this bare bones LX The drivers seat adjusted for fore aft seatback tilt and seat height I found that the seat somehow became more uncomfortable as I raised it The seat did not not_hug not_me not_as not_well not_as not_my not_cars not_seat but it supported me in the right places As soon as I brought it to Tucson from the harsh life of the San Francisco Bay Area the car acquired another huge dent in the front fender using the few drops of Bay Area gasoline left in its tank it had been towed here not not_driven The interior continued the exterior styling with a dashboard full of asymmetric shapes and bold diagonal lines interrupted by perfectly oval vents Conventional would be the last thing to describe this dashboard but I liked it Although the dashboard was made entirely of hard plastic it did not not_feel not_or not_look not_cheap The steering wheel while not not_as not_nice as the one in my Contour was still good with thickened grab points at 10 and 2 positions and the turn signal and windshield wiper stalks were within easy reach Next to the parking brake lever I could even find a pen holder I also tried the rear seat and found plenty of headroom there but legroom seemed a bit more cramped than my Contour The paint seemed smooth the interior materials seemed substantial and I could not not_find not_a not_single not_rattle but then this was a brand new car so it had better be quiet Aside from a slightly damaged roofliner fastener I saw no defects I could hear some engine noise during acceleration but otherwise the car was fairly quiet Even the turn signal clicks were soft and synthesized soothing enough to inspire a few poems That meant I had to arrange yet another rental car for the duration of the repairs of course after yelling out a few choice words on this final Bay Area curse I was happy to pick up a brand new Cloud Nine White 2001 Ford Focus LX 4 door sedan with a whopping 28 miles on the odometer Although it differed significantly from the spunky ZX3 hatchback most of the other reviewers wrote about I still found the car to be very pleasant The Exterior The trunk with its high lid was fairly spacious but not not_deep and thoughtfully it came with a fluorescent pull handle which trapped children and adults could use to escape I trapped myself in the trunk just to test it out and it was very easy to use Even better for children this car came with three child seat anchors above the rear seat but on the other hand the child lock switches are hidden deep inside the rear doors and requires the key to flip Performance In the middle of the dashboard was a large emergency flasher switch large and illuminated just like those on Volkswagens Below it a large easy to use radio cassette player welcomed me and even at low volume settings I could hear it clearly although I felt quite some distortion at higher volumes Below the radio was the climate control system with separate A C and recirculation buttons and many options for airflow adjustment just like the excellent systems in Japanese cars and Volkswagens and a far improvement over the old fashioned controls of my Contour And yes the A C was very cold The Interior Seating As the repairs to my Contour only took three days I did not not_have not_too not_much not_of not_a not_time not_to not_check not_this not_Focus not_out not_on not_the not_road not_Tucsons not_dead not_straight not_streets not_also not_offered not_little not_opportunity not_to not_test not_out not_the not_handling not_of not_the not_vehicle Nevertheless I drove around quite a bit heading out of town to nearby mountain passes to watch the beautiful desert sunsets and to test this cars cornering abilities Although the steering did not not_feel not_as not_direct not_as not_my not_cars not_it not_was not_still not_fairly not_sharp not_and not_responsive and I could take mountain curves at 10 15 mph above recommended speeds without feeling the car lean into the corners There have also been eight recalls for the Focus which I reflected in the reliability rating I am also concerned with other Ford of Europe products such as the bigger Contour and even the Jaguar X Type which were designed by the same folks and share much of the engineering and some parts My Contour review has been downgraded accordingly i Below is the original review from 2 22 2001 which I chose not not_to not_alter not_in not_any not_way not_despite not_the not_disturbing not_information not_above not_I not_dont not_know not_why not_but not_my not_Ford not_Contour not_seems not_to not_have not_a not_huge not_affinity not_for not_body not_shops It is very true and for the most part I love it The very geometric shapes of the wheel well arches the sharp and triangular headlights and the fixed antenna mounted over the center of the car all served to give this car a personality The Focus developed in Europe just like my Contour definitely looked the part features like the center mounted radio antenna are very common in small European cars and on the streets of Tucson where jellybean shaped Korean cars dominate this car was a standout Even the wheel covers on the standard 14 stock wheels looked decent I must however say that the Focus sedan looks rather boring next to the sporty hatchback version The Interior Dashboard The way the hood and the doors closed and the way the car drove told me that despite what the Ford marketers may claim the Focus is not not_a not_replacement not_for not_the not_Contour not_Yes not_this is a fantastic car a superb replacement for the Escort and a formidable competitor to the likes of Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla but this is still a smaller car not not_in not_the not_league not_of not_bigger not_heftier not_cars not_like not_VW not_Jetta not_VW not_Golf and Fords own Contour Yes the Focus has more headroom than the Contour but that is only because the Contour got saddled with a ridiculously low roofline Pricing As I put away my rental contract in the glovebox I found the cars sticker But then Ford crammed lots of extras into this car as standard equipment including a high quality cassette player an electric not not_cable not_trunk not_release fold down rear seats power steering and a large 2 0 liter engine to start with True I could find a car for less but they would lack some of these features many people now take for granted Besides once I drop the 815 automatic transmission even a loaded ZX3 hatchback with cruise control and power accessories could be had for the price of this lowly LX and the top line ZTS sedan would still be under 16 000 I wont complain with this kind of pricing And since the likes of carsdirect com sell the Focus at near invoice prices the pricing will be even sweeter than these MSRP figures suggest Verdict Contrary to Fords marketers the Focus does not not_replace not_the not_Contour But it is an outstanding replacement for the Escort Although I was saddled with the rock bottom LX with lackluster powertrain I still was able to enjoy the cars thoughtful features European personality and precise handling I had driven a top

Neg,The service department at Koons took the car in right away and about a half hour later we were told that the cars alternator was dead We hadnt done anything to cause a problem but slam on the brakes when a bird flew out in front of the car As we were driving down the road the transmission started slipping again more violently this time and the interior and exterior lights started to flicker on and off The car looks great and when it works it drives like a dream but who buys a car to have it in the shop all the time We drove it for about 30 minutes so that the car would be warmed up and then as we were driving by WorldCom in Ashburn the problem started again This car has proven to be very unreliable for people who need a reliable car to drive to and from work and take care of their family After researching different types of small to mid sized cars earlier this year I decided that the Ford Focus was definitely the type of car I wanted for myself The next day when I picked up the car from Jerrys Leesburg Ford I was told that a sensor had blown that they replaced it and everything should be fine So my husband and I got up extra early that Tuesday this would be September 17th and went on a rather lengthy test drive with the technician and still the problem did not not_occur not_again So we waited until about 5 30 p m as we were promised they would have the car all fixed up by the close of business that afternoon and went to go visit Matt in the service department At this point the technicians were being extremely helpful and said that if we didnt not_mind not_having not_extra not_miles not_put not_on not_the not_car the technician would drive it to and from his home in Front Royal that evening to see if it occurred during his drive We got the car home as soon as we could given the traffic around our area and the next day took it out for a test drive since Carmax the dealer would not not_be not_open not_again not_until not_Monday not_morning not_to not_see not_if not_we not_could not_pin not_down not_what not_was not_causing not_the not_problem They were right for about three months that is Our first sign of trouble occurred on September 11 2002 when I was driving my husband back from his eye doctor appointment in Reston VA We were driving home and the transmission seemed to slip Having driven an old car for most of my life I just thought it was a normal thing and brushed it off but that weekend it got worse After going to our local mall on Saturday September 14th the car decided to throw us for another loop This is unfortunately not

told to go to the Ford dealer as Carmax wouldnt not_touch not_it So I called into work telling them I would be late and we went over to the Koons Ford in Sterling VA to drop the car off I got a call from them later that afternoon telling me that the service technicians were unable to find any problems with the car and could we please come in for a test drive the following morning The next morning still nothing was found and we were forced to pick up the car that afternoon with no resolution P P Surprisingly though the car behaved alright for the next couple of days and didnt not_exhibit

it started doing the same thing it had been doing back when this whole thing started On Friday October 25th on the way home from my husbands oral surgery the cars transmission started slipping the interior and exterior lights blinked on and off and all the gages on the dash shot up and then went back down to normal Since my husband was still somewhat sedated I decided to wait until the next morning to take the car to Koons Ford That Saturday I took the car in and told them to call me when they had it fixed About 4 00 p m on Saturday October 27th we received a call from the dealer telling us that what was wrong was a loose ground wire and they fixed it and the car was ready for pick up It sounded plausible so we piled into one of our friends cars as my husband could still not not_drive

not_May not_has not_turned not_into not_my not_worst not_nightmare It was only a little bigger than my old car a 1989 Dodge Omni it had a ton of fun new features and it seemed pretty reliable from the information I could find on the Internet about it So after applying for a new car loan from my bank and finding the Focus I wanted from Carmaxs website I went in and bought myself a new car P P I was excited I had all these new features and a bigger engine to play with My car came stocked with power windows power door locks AM FM radio a CD player and the new Ztech engine we had heard about I was very proud of this shiny new car showed it off to everyone where I worked took my friends and family on test drives to show how great this car was and recommended Focuses and Carmax to everyone P P And then the first problem hit Almost a week after we bought the car on the way home from work the check engine light came on When I pulled into Carmax I was brushed off by the service department

Neg,The car sounds like an old diesel engine My dealer has been unable to fix the stumble The engine loses RPM and stumbles as if its going to stall at almost every traffic light This vehicle has spent 16 days in the shop because of a variety of fuel system and transmission problems 5spd manual To say I am dissappointed Six months and 7 000 miles into my ownership experience is a gross understatement You may have read my initial review of the 2001 Focus ZX3 where I lauded the cars impressive features for the price impressive handling styling and comfort There is no doubt that the noise will substantially impair the trade or resale value of this car and it suggests that a more serious transmission problem is yet to come Ford says the noise is normal Gas consumption is MUCH less than Ford claims under all driving conditions There is a noise coming form the cargo area which sounds like a mechanic left a wrench or something inside the body I am filing for the lemon law hearing this week I highly suggest you run a word search in the USENET archives and check out the problems people are reporting with their Focus The dealership initially insisted that there was nothing wrong with the transmission and that they could not not_duplicate not_my not_complaint not_After not_doing not_exhaustive not_internet not_research not_I not_found not_that not_the not_transmission not_problem not_affects not_ALMOST not_EVERY not_Focus not_with not_the not_5 not_speed not_manual not_I not_also not_found not_that not_although not_Ford not_initially not_denied not_there not_was not_any not_such not_problem not_the not_company not_has not_recently not_issued not_a not_service not_bulletin not_regarding not_gear not_rollover not_noise not_Gear not_rollover not_causes not_a not_distinct not_chattering not_from not_the not_transmission
Neg,The trunk was exceptionally large for a car this size The car turned around in literally no space at all In fact the radio seemed to have two volume positions off and loud The front seats had plenty of headroom due to the high profile of the car In all fairness to Ford and people who rated the Focus highly I rated mine on a rental car It has a very tight turning radius Gas mileage appeared to be very good but I didnt not_actually not_keep not_track The high rear deck caused me problems when looking in the rear view mirror Road handling on the highway didnt not_impress not_me It was a basic model with automatic trans but plain interior Perhaps the one I rented wasnt not_typical not_of not_all not_models In fact if I were making a choice in buying a low price car I would look to a 1997 Camry or Honda for a much better value The dash board looks like Ford had stock in a plastics company Maybe the bulk was supposed to impress me but it looked downright ugly The Focus seemed to wander too much and not not_give not_me not_a not_firm not_steering not_feel not_I not_didnt not_find not_the not_dash not_buttons not_door not_locks not_radio not_controls not_etc not_to not_be not_exceptional It had minimal pickup and I didnt not_care not_for not_the not_road not_feel not_I not_kept not_the not_car not_at not_around not_70 not_mph and it seemed to be straining to go faster The car was quiet enough in the city but on the road Getouttahere New York construction sites are quieter I heard that droning road noise especially from the rear long enough to put me in a straight jacket The things I didnt not_like not_First not_of not_all not_who not_in not_Ford not_gets not_paid not_to not_style not_these not_things not_Maybe not_its not_just not_not not_my not_cup not_of not_tea but I think the style to quote my 12 year old sucks There was no in between and with todays rock that I had to listen to for hours well I think you know my feelings Bottom line the car simply didnt not_math not_up not_to not_my not_1990 not_Toyota not_Camry not_in not_any not_category Also I tend to base my opinion about cars on my 1990 Toyota Camry and this is probably unfair to American car manufacturers read that anyway you want Some positives about the car I liked the size of the car very compact but with ample room for up to four people
Neg,This time It does this pretty frequently Our trunk opens itself randomly This thing has a horrible resale value This car is a lemon plain and simple The dealer replaced it Both rear seatbelts have malfunctioned After the cars warranty expired I looked into it myself Go to the section to review customer complaints and defect investigations The passenger side seatbelt doesnt latch securely and will often times undo itself We ve NEVER gotten over 22mpg average on a tank of gas They finally comped the service Poor mileage Ford bills this car as an economy car There was a recall for this and I took it in In late 2003 the Kelly Blue Book wholesale value of the car is about 4 500 Thats for a 2 5 year old car that started out costing 13 000 more We ve had the radio replaced twice with no success Passenger side headlight burns out after about a week The window is currently being held up by a piece of wood I wedged inside the door They said the sticker is just an estimate and cars usually get far less than the window sticker says We took the car back to two other dealers for the same fuel mileage problems and not not_once could they identify a problem The cable that pulls the window up and down is attached by a flimsy plastic piece that broke off We asked why the window sticker said it would get over 30 mpg but was getting under 20 at the time We took it back to Ford after having the car for about a month and they told us that is normal The drivers side rear seatbelt will often lock after being pulled out about 12 inches which makes it useless and unuseable At a different dealer they put on heavy duty brake pads and rotors that have lasted so far 50 000 miles on the car now As soon as we get the check from the bank to pay off the Focus it will be going back to Ford Good riddance My wife and I bought the car in April 2001 to replace an Escort that had just ended its lease and we had no trouble with Brake problems All three times we had to take the car in and they fixed it The a pillar trim on the driver side came loose and was about to fall off Our transmission will downshift for no reason ive had the car on cruise control on a flat freeway and the transmission will downshift itself race the engine for a few seconds and then upshift again They tried charging us for the work but I went in with a stack of about 100 pages of printouts from http www fordfocusbrakeproblems com and the NHTSA website of customer complaints exactly like ours When it does that it will stay locked for several hours so anyone sitting there cant not_use not_the not_seatbelt not_on not_that not_trip not_Of not_course the Ford dealers were unable to duplicate either of those problems On the freeway the plastic moulding around the rear wheelwell came loose and was barely hanging on I had to stop and snap the piece back on The passenger side air bag cover has started opening up three times It just started doing this about a month ago but im not not_bothering

not_going not_over not_bumps Three days ago we bought a 1996 conversion van to replace the Focus with We have almost a year left on our lease but we opted to pay the remainder of the lease off so that we could get into something safer and more reliable The only good thing about this car is it is pretty roomy for a small economy car im 6 3 and fit fairly comfortably in it If you want to read hundreds of other horror stories from Focus owners check out the following two web sites http www fordfocusbrakeproblems com and http nhtsa gov The dealer went so far as to suggest that the problem is that my wife drives the car most of the time and since shes a female she was probably feathering the brake pedal causing them to wear out quickly 20 000 miles we had to replace front and rear brakes AGAIN The thumping stopped for a few months but started up again Ford claims they cant not_hear not_it not_Our not_rear not_passenger not_side not_window not_fell not_into not_the not_door not_a not_few not_weeks not_ago and of course it did it while it was pouring down rain I had to try to fix it in the rain too We ll be driving down the street and the door ajar light will come on The Ford dealer claims that is impossible and told me that I was probabbly accidentally hitting the trunk release button on the dashboard without knowing it Our windshield was hit by a small piece of gravel on the freeway Instead of creating a small pit it caused a large crack that runs across the entire windshield Within half an hour I found a vacuum tube coming from the exhaust manifold that had been manufactured with a hole in it I replaced the tube with a new one and the car instantly ran better and started getting about 5mpg better Not one of the three dealers I had taken the car to was able to find it Other problems we ve had Radio turns itself off and on occassionally usually on long trips Within the cars first week the brakes were grinding We took it in to the dealer where we were told Thats normal Focuses do that Within 6 000 miles the front and rear brakes needed to be replaced Originally the Ford dealer tried to charge us for the repair but after arguing for about an hour and having to explain to them why the rear brakes should NEVER have to be replaced after 5 000 miles they finally did the work as warranty 14 000 miles we had the same problem Again the dealer tried to charge us to fix the brakes and again we refused
Neg,The dealership could not not_find not_any not_problem The gearshift lever manual transmission would often stick and not not_go not_into not_4th not_gear The initial price of the Focus is low but so is the quality It only took a few months for it to be transformed into lemonade There were a few driveability concerns with the car that were also not not_resolved But better yet purchase a 1 2 3 year old Honda or Toyota and have a great car without the headaches of a Focus If you really need a NEW car and dont not_have not_much not_to not_spend not_you not_d not_be not_better not_off not_with not_a not_Hyundai The car died while driving 4 times and often felt like it was going to die when approaching a stop light On cold winter mornings 2nd and 4th gears had to be bypassed for the first few minutes of driving because the lever would not not_go not_into not_the not_gears This DID NOT fix the problem Since nearly the entire interior was disassembled to resolve the creaking problem more squeaks and rattles were now present from the plastic trim panels coming apart The car is rated 25 City 33 Highway miles gallon and I never saw anything close to this I drove 60 70 on the interstate daily and never averaged more than 24 mpg After a few unsuccessful attempts of the dealership trying to fix this one of Fords engineers from Detroit was flown in Spot welds in the rear chassis were drilled out and replaced with rivets This car was awarded European Car of the Year and the North American Car of the Year I was so impressed by these accolades and the positive magazine reviews that I purchased a silver ZX3 in May 2001 The dealer said this was normal All in all my Focus ZX3 was at the dealer 6 times in the first 6 months of ownership for a whopping total of 43 business days I contacted Fords Dispute Settlement Board and asked them to repurchase my vehicle under the Lemon Law They reviewed my case and a few months later Ford offered to replace my car with a brand new Focus or apply my money spent toward any new Ford product I stood my ground and told them I would never buy another Ford and wanted my money back My family and friends warned me and I didnt not_listen not_After not_owning not_6 not_European not_cars not_in not_10 not_years not_I not_did not_something not_I not_vowed not_to not_never not_do not_purchase not_an not_American not_car not_Problems not_occurred not_with not_my not_vehicle not_within not_the not_first not_month not_A not_loud not_creaking not_sound not_was not_evident not_from not_the not_rear not_of not_the not_car not_when not_turning not_corners My case was heard before the board and I won Weeks later a check was cut and I was refunded full purchase price including tax title and license Based upon my experiences and a few of my friends that own Focuses I try to sway everyone I know away from a the car
Neg,It ended up being totaled See the pictures at http www geocities com archangel jjn So far Fords basic response is that it is an insurance issue so if you think your car is protected by factory warranty against catastrophic failure even from an issue covered by a recall think again they ll leave you out swinging in the breeze and you re left with only your insurance payout on the rapidly shrinking book value to pick up and start over http www geocities com archangel jjn I really loved this car it was small and fun until the cowl cover cracked and it leaked into the passenger footwell every time it rained or I went to the car wash moisture entered the headlight and it needed to be replaced the cruise control stopped functioning the rear wheel bearings needed to be replaced due to a recall the wiper motor stopped working in the winter and needed to be replaced and before I owned it it needed new brake pads and rotors despite having less than 15 000 miles a new transmission and associated cooling hoses a new hatch strut and finally after only having it 7 months and still being well within original factory warranty it caught fire all by itself by a recall that happened 4 months after my incident
Neg,In addition Then came the recalls BEginning with an axel related problem ive had 2 announced and 2 pending recalls of the focus WHile the dealers are quick to correct the situation having to make a special trip and arrangements both recalls required leaving the car all day with no loner was not not_what not_i not_expected not_from not_a not_new not_car That said having driven friends vws hondas and saturns the focus feels like a car in a higher price range than these but it lacks the problem free nature these cars seem to have Advice Buy with caution the 2003 models offer a 100K warranty The focus is a great small car on driving alone it is by far the best small car offered in America the interior wouldnt not_be not_out not_of not_place not_in not_a not_luxury not_badge not_the not_car not_is not_pleasent not_to not_drive not_very not_quiet not_even not_at not_highway not_speeds The car has refused to start 3 different times and stalled out once the dealer is clueless as to the source of the problem ive had the Focus for over 2 years now and am approaching the end of my warranty mileage and wonder if I ll be put in a situation where I have to dish out my own money to fix future problems My only complaint a car this size should get even better gas mileage though it averages about 29 mpg highway in city driving it can be much lower this with the 5 speed standard transmission not not_much better than the pinto ford built almost 30 years ago A few months of living with the Focus and I was sure this was the best economic choice I had ever made When it came time to replace my well worn 1987 Jetta I wanted a hatchback and the most logical choice was a Golf Apon seeing the hatchback version of the Focus however I decided to up the list of consideration to 2 After test driving both cars I found the Focus was by far the better deal and walked out of the dealership with a brand new 5 speed 3 door hatchback with the racy sounding zx3 badge with a c alloy wheels cd stereo and rather useless fog lamps for 3000 less than a Golf with only a c
Neg,This was due to bad gauge sensor anther trip to the Ford mechanic At freeway speeds gt 55 mph the engine noise is as loud as a delivery truck In addition the fuel pump on this car went out at 26 000 miles Trip number 3 to the Ford mechanic In addition there have been numerous recalls on this lemon I feel like I should make a standing appointment with the Ford mechanic My wife bought this car in 2001 and at first within the first 5000 miles the car seemed like a decent choice for a small sedan Yes this is a 4 cylinder vehicle that struggles to accelerate rapidly and labors to do anything But the problem is not not_simply not_due not_to not_being not_4 not_cylinders We ve tried the most powerful industrial strength vacuums out there with no luck 4 Rapid depreciation the bottom line is if you buy a Focus expect to keep it awhile as it depreciates at a rate much faster than your average car At higher speeds gt 55 mph the car shutters and every road bump is felt Long trips are an exhausting experience Needless to say this is the last Ford my wife and I plan to buy A Honda Civic or Toyota Corolla are much better uses of your car buying dollar We owe in excess of 10k on the loan according to Edmunds com the car is worth about 6400 for a trade in 8200 if sold privately a loss either way we might choose to sell it 5 Driving comfort the ride for this car is stiff and the front drivers and passengers seats are cramped But in the last year or so we have regretted the day we signed the loan papers on this close to being a lemon Heres why Please note the Focus in question has 32 200 miles on it currently 1 Loud weak Engine even when this car is driven at speeds less than 30 mph there is a pronounced loud drone of the engine The brakes and engine belts squeak horribly whenever the outside humidity goes much above 50 The belt squeaking is especially embarassing ive had people at stopped traffic signals ask me to roll my window down to say Excuse me but is there something wrong with your car sir 3 Poor fabric in seats where everything Lint hair etc sticks to like a magnet In comparison to our other car a 2000 Honda Civic 4 cylinders the Civic appears to be a V6 and the engine noise is not not_1 not_4 not_as not_loud not_2 not_Bizarre not_problems not_including not_a not_trunk not_door not_that not_takes not_TWO not_slams not_of not_the not_lid not_to not_close not_down not_from not_THREE not_after not_a not_trip not_to not_the not_Ford not_mechanic not_A not_gas not_gauge not_that not_never not_shows not_FULL not_even not_when not_the not_tank not_is not_full not_leaving not_the not_pump
Neg,The engine revvs very smooth He could verify the rattle I got the car from Sunnyvale Ford But I can also rev it and have fun This time I went for a test ride with a mechanic The version with 5 sp manual transmission is fun to drive The power is available from low 2000rpm to well over 5000rp m It was noticeable and sometimes pretty loud when driving over 60mph It is easy to cruise at 45 mph in 5th gear In part this must be caused by airconditioning taking power from the engine The center arm rest seems to have been designed for cars with automatic transmission This might explain the lameness of the Focus with automatic but that is just a guess The breaks are also very good and ABS helps when it rains And now the COMPLAINTS At about 5000 miles I started noticing a rattle coming from the rear of the car The thing I really like about this car is that it feels very stable in curves It was installed but the rattle continued Some 3000 miles later I brought the car again with the same problem It took me 4 visit to the service department before they finally fixed it by replacing the instrument panel bezel So in Summer the car is fun to drive only in the mornings when the air and engine are cool After two weeks about 750 miles I noticed a bulge on the hood near the right hinge I took it back to the dealer So far I have never felt that the car was loosing grip in a curve and I have tried to push it a few times It took one look at it to figure out that they were the source of the noise I wrapped some duct tape around them and the rattle stopped It shifts up at very low revs while the engine likes to be revved Later I learned that the new automatic transmissions as well as modern engines learn some program parameters during the first 30 50 miles It appears that some moron at factory dealership closed the hood with the rod still supporting it It took them 4 days to fix the hood as it had to be repainted One reason I picked ZTS over SE is that ZTS has standard 16 wheels with 205 50 tires I test drove Focus ZTS with an automatic and I must say that it felt very lame They replaced alternator made and programmed two keys for 87 replaced rear brake shoes reprogrammed engine computer and washed the car I havent driven the car much since then so I cannot not_tell not_yet not_if not_the not_stumble not_hesitation not_has not_been not_fixed What it shows is that the Sunnyvale Ford mechanics do not not_really not_know not_the not_cars not_they not_work not_on not_In not_Summer not_I not_noticed not_that not_on not_hot not_days not_the not_engine not_has not_much not_less not_power not_especially not_between not_2000rpm not_and not_3000rp not_m However the power loss is there also with AC off I read some discussions at internet Ford Focus forums and it seems that the power loss in higher temperatures is partly caused by bad design of the EGR exhaust gas recirculation system It was difficult to locate precisely but it seemed to come from somewhere near rear right wheel I brought the car twice to the dealership to have this fixed First time they thought that some exhaust hanger was missing They have good ideas but they fail in implementation I do have another Ford an Escape but I think that its build quality isnt not_great either I think I will try another car brand when time comes to replace my current Fords It seems that the EGR valve opens too fast and at the wrong time robbing the engine of power when it needs it most i e while accelerating Pity because with the hesitation between 2000 and 3000 rpm the car does not not_feel not_zippy not_anymore and is not not_such not_fun not_to not_drive It is in the way when lifted up and one has to lift it up to use a hand brake comfortably In May when the outside temperatures got higher I noticed that the dashboard started squeaking like mutilated squirrel sounded like two pieces of styrofoam rubbed against each other It took me a while to convince them that the bulge was something that had to be fixed and that it wasnt not_me not_that not_caused not_it not_The not_convincing not_part not_was not_that not_I not_found not_a not_bent not_steel not_rod not_under not_the not_front not_seat not_which not_turned not_out not_to not_be not_a not_support not_rod not_for not_the not_hood In my opinion it seems to be a good place to buy a car but not not_a not_good not_place to service it If you want to service your car in the San Jose area better go to Frontier Ford in Santa Clara I got the ZTS Sedan which had every option possible except Advance Track and automatic transmission It looks like new I only hope that the paint will last as long as the original I got a rental car for the period that my car was being fixed however they initially did not not_want not_to not_pay not_insurance not_on not_the not_rental not_car not_Eventually not_I not_got not_a not_100 not_voucher not_to not_compensate not_for not_the not_money not_I not_spent not_on not_rental not_car not_insurance Before they decided to replace it they tried spraying WD 40 or something like it between the bezel and the dash and loosening the screws that hold it this made the dash rattle so that I had to take the car back to the service where they tightened the crews which made the dash squeak again Altogether this was very annoying experience At 16900 miles the battery light came on This time I took the car to be fixed at Frontier Ford I also requested them to make and program 2 spare keys I lost one do something about squeaking rear brakes and check if TSB 01 16 3 technical service bulletin applied to my car it is supposed to fix the engine stumble hesitation by reprogramming engine computer Frontier Ford did a good job on my car He said that it was a tough one but did not not_do not_anything not_about not_it not_apart not_from not_adjusting not_rear not_right not_door not_which not_was not_a not_bit not_misaligned Basically he told me to see if this helps and if not not_then not_to not_come not_again I am sick of coming again and again to the dealership Fortunately someone at www focaljet com forum gave me a hint to look at the aerodynamic deflectors placed in front of rear wheels and suspension So what are my conclusions Sometimes I like my Focus e g morning drives to work and sometimes I wish I bought a different car e g drives on hot weekends when it feels felt weak I still have to see if this problem has been fixed Would I buy another Focus I dont not_think not_so not_If not_I not_were not_to not_buy not_a not_similar not_sized not_car

Neg,He has tired of the weekly trips to the dealership The bumpers are constantly detaching from the vehicle and the front side panels are too My son has finally resorted to a type of automotive super glue to fasten these parts back onto his car It has good pick up and is easy to handle His is a standard My sons Focus came with cloth interior and a great stereo system They are sporty and economical Fifteen dollars a week is all my son has ever spent on gas and some weeks have seen quite a few miles The Focus is an attractive car at an attractive price and this is sadly part of the reason young buyers are flocking to Ford dealers to buy them Our 20 year old son purchased a Ford Focus a few months ago Paying 12 995 for this car we didnt not_expect not_luxury but we did expect good quality The CD player was included I guess if one is looking for a cheap set of brand new wheels the Focus is enticing However because so many young people are purchasing it due to its affordability I do have deep concerns regarding safety Yet I remain concerned about the safety of this vehicle as it doesnt appear to be solidly built and besides who wants to trust a vehicle to protect its occupants if the outside parts keep falling off Aside from these complaints my son does insist that his Focus runs like a dream So far thats not not_what not_we not_ve not_found not_Shortly not_after not_purchasing not_it not_he not_received not_notification not_of not_two not_recalls not_which not_of not_course not_the not_dealer not_promptly not_took not_care not_of not_From not_there not_however not_its not_been not_lots not_of not_little not_things not_things not_that not_will not_undoubtedly not_eventually not_nickel not_and not_dime not_him not_to not_death not_if not_the not_car not_even not_retains not_that not_kind not_of not_value not_The not_Focus not_feels not_like not_its not_made not_of not_tin not_and not_plastic not_Leaning not_on not_the not_hood not_or not_trunk not_will not_sometimes not_cause not_buckling
Neg,The car was awesome This was my first mistake I was recently married So what does this mean for me It is not not_on not_the not_parts not_list not_nor not_in not_the not_diagram not_of not_little not_pictures This was six weeks ago What is the deal you ask While down here I was in an accident I was rear ended by some punk kid The result of this is the one part stopping my car from being on the road does not not_exist The damage was minimal to my untrained eye so I figured that it would be in the shop for a couple of weeks and then I would have my car back This has been one of the worst experiences of my life and I dread even thinking about what would happen if I were to be in another car accident with this vehicle My husband and I decided we should buy a car After much consideration and various test drives we decided against the Ford Ranger and went with the 2001 Ford Focus my theory being where would we put the kids in a truck We had a great time bombing around in our brand new car and decided to take it on a road trip when I drove him back to California where he works I was to stay in California for a few weeks then return back to Toronto Well let me tell you Ford puts out manuals of car parts Little pictures with all the parts drawn neatly in a little square and then a list of all the parts you would need to fix the car Unfortuantely someone somewhere was slacking on the job or was too high to realise what he was drawing and perhaps turned to drawing little doodles instead of the parts This means endless hours on the phone to my insurance company Ford Customer Service who by the way assure me that there will be an internal investigation the Body Shop who is fixing my car who are actually a Ford Dealership Body Shop and my parents trying to figure out a way to get my vehicle and get me home Rental bills so I do not not_have not_to not_be not_stuck not_sitting not_here not_with not_no not_car not_are not_piling not_up and although my insurance company is reimbursing me that does nothing for me now Apparently this is not not_the not_only not_problem not_they not_have not_had not_Seatbelts not_transmissions not_seats not_panels not_etc not_have not_all not_taken not_between not_2 not_weeks not_and not_6 not_months not_to not_arrive not_at not_various not_body not_shops not_in not_North not_America not_leaving not_you not_the not_proud not_Ford not_automobile not_owner not_stranded
Neg,The 4 door models lack the daring design of the 2 door and the station wagons are even more conservative Though the car started off very tight fit and finish seemed to deteriorate after a year Overall Good design that seems to have suffered major Quality Control problems Commuter car in the 2 door format Much more stylish than a Civic I did feel as if I was sitting very low to the ground but then again I was coming off an Explorer Though the dash is ergonomically correct some cost cutting is noticeable with the lack of warning lights and lights on buzzers Front seats were firm and supportive Rear seating even in the 2 door was fine for 2 smaller adults Rear hatch stores a big trunk space Over time however the seat fabric has begun to wear The Seatbelts anchors plastic guards are cracking and the cheapie no tach dash is pretty uninformative Quality revised When my 2001 Explorer Sports transmission died see my review I ended up with a Ford Focus 2 door as a rental for the week Coming from a big and tall SUV to a small city commuter I was worried about the Focus being under powered but I was pleasantly surprised at the pep even with an automatic transmission Engine Peppy for city driving even with auto transmission Highway driving is also smooth Interior Extremely cool dash design
Neg,So we ve been in several accidents with it some in which would be classified as totaled to the cost even though it wasnt not_all not_that not_bad not_anyway not_so not_we not_got not_them not_all not_fixed not_and not_it not_still not_runs not_pretty not_good not_sometimes not_the not_heat not_doesnt not_work but besides that there little or no problems It is a 92 got it used about a year after it came out so it was basically as close to factory condition as you r going to get without actually being there so let me talk about ours the cigerette lighter in the back doesnt work is our only major problem but we dont not_need not_that not_anyway
Neg,No features no nothing Just a simple HEAVY DUTY minivan Sorry for my English So when I got back to my Aerostar I wasnt not_happy I bought my Aerostar 1992 from a friend about a year ago with over 110 000 miles for a 1500 bucks The new minivans today excluding Chevy Astro has a low step in height which is great On the other hand it has a very strong engine Its a truck like van with the powerful and noisy engine Also the power windows doesnt work fine I have to push it down with my hands to HELP the power The sliding door is not not_closed not_unless not_you not_close not_it not_with not_full not_power not_and not_you not_hear not_a not_THUNDER not_noise not_and not_the not_whole not_van not_shudders The stereo system sounds very bad I also dislike that you have to climb in into the van Like a big SUV So every time you have to try about 3 4 times to close it I also hate the design of the Aerostar Also had a lot of problems w the Air conditioning The Aerostar is not not_Braking not_is not_also not_poor not_All not_passengers not_are not_feeling not_that not_im not_braking not_now not_If not_you not_dont not_wear not_seat not_belts not_you not_almost not_fall not_down not_when not_braking not_When not_I not_stop not_at not_a not_traffic not_light not_etc not_the not_van not_shudders not_and not_shivers He sold this van because he disliked the van Comparing to toadys new minivans the Aerostar is far from the good minivans Makes big noise at driving Steering wheel makes also big noise at each turn Rides very bumpy Its not not_comfortable not_to not_drive not_long not_trips not_Toadys not_new not_cars not_minivans not_are not_very not_smooth And its better than nothing Its my first vehicle so im happy with it until I ll have money for a better one I need a minivan for the room of it ive once rented a Ford Windstar 2000 and another time the Pontiac Montana 2001 and they re unbelievable Very smooth good braking comfortable seating and nice panels with a lot of features

Neg,My wife inherited it in 1996 One winter morning the temperature dropped to 5 degrees This car has a mind of its own My father in law bought this car new in Nov 1993 The drive side door hinges broke and had to be replaced At that time we had a 1994 t bird that I loved Now the hinges on the passenger side need replacing At 63 000 miles it had a blown head gasket Cost 2500 00 The tachometer went out at 1 year Needed brakes at 2 years 14 000 miles Master cylinder and calipers at 20 000 miles 3 years The car has 64 000 miles on it now and last night my wife pulled out into traffic and the car stalled It had the V8 motor and was a blast to drive Very reliable Any way at 35 000 miles the brakes went out again It has the 3 8l v6 I dont not_have not_to not_tell not_you not_about not_the not_3 not_8l not_Ford not_V6 not_From not_the not_beginning not_he not_had not_problems not_with not_the not_electrical not_system not_Ford not_repaired not_the not_tail not_light not_assembly At 50 000 miles I was in a parking lot and started to back out and brushed up against a guard rail and the whole front bumper assembly came off Cost 1500 00 Both door panels are falling apart When my wife started the car the left turn signal came on all by itself the right side window kept going up and down all by itself the horn started blowing and the head lights started flashing between high and low beam and then off She almost had a wreck Some wonderful people pushed it off the road for her and that is where it is now Going to have it towed to a junk yard today and buy a Dodge Intrepid DO NOT BUY THIS CAR UNLESS YOU ARE A VERY RICH PERSON THAT WANTS TO THROW YOUR MONEY AWAY
Neg,The car gets decent gas mileage on the highway but really sucks it down in the daily driving around town All in all we are pleased with it but are ready to pay it off and start with something else The interior is very roomy and comfortable Ours is loaded with power everything which is great Power windows are the best when you are alone in the car and need that passenger window down same with power door locks I loved this car until everything started going wrong with it It has been in the shop numerous times just for recalls how safe can that be Then it has been in the shop for repairs and they can never seem to find the problem Now for the good things
Neg,This car has been a nightmare This was a big year for the car In late december the a c dies car has 68 thousand miles on it now 2000 The car begins to float all over the road At 45 k it needs tie rods It also needs brakes again and a sensor goes out and the car leaves me stranded The car did require lower ball joints and brakes this year though and an alternator car still does not not_have not_30 not_k not_on not_it not_1996 Before you jump to conclusions about how i have abused the car let me give you the cars history 1993 It took ford 1000 dollars worth of work to find the sensor that made the car shut off for no reason In january the headlights die for the second time and i have to replace the blinker switch has headlight controls in it also My dad bought a beautiful black t bird lx with red interior Within a week of having the car the back tail light almost caught fire and has been broken since The door hinges on the drivers side actually brake in august of this year Late that year the transmission has to be taken back 1999 In a rainstorm with a trashbag over the windows i sit in the car at a friends house and replace the window switches now one window works and still no locks It is currently sitting in front of my house with a tarp over it because the windows no longer work or the locks or the a c or the headlights While driving the car home the headlights died for the final time and so did the radio final mileage 77 833 Cosmetically the car has no dents or scratches and still shines like new Not a bad year for the car the door handle on the passenger side breaks loose this year though car still does not not_have not_30 not_k not_on not_it not_1997 not_Car not_requires not_brakes not_again The car was purchased in late november 1994 no problems my dad barely puts any miles on the car 1995 babied as usual car has always been washed at least once a week and waxed roughly once every two months The interior is spotless no rips in the leather no stains nothing from reading the posts on this site its half and half on the reliability but overall these cars are a nightmare I would not not_recommend not_buying not_a not_t not_bird not_to not_my not_worst not_enemy At 39 thousand miles the transmission goes out the a c compressor also begins to whine a bit lower ball joints again this year the speedometer breaks also 1998 I purchase the car from my dad in february I gut the stereo system install alarm and new rims Car once shut off while i tried to cross the street and i almost got hit by all three lanes of cars the headlights die now both sides of the doors have broken loose cant not_run not_the not_a not_c or the car will overheat Another alternator and the entire ignition need to be replaced and a battery and more brakes and the car is almost impossible to keep in one lane while on the interstate In march the locks begin to stick on the doors and the front end has a terrible sound coming from it in april i finally replace the rack and pinion lower ball joints and a few bushings for 862 dollars still no a c in car 3 days later it looks like it is going to rain for the first time in months i go to roll up the windows and neither of them work the power locks no longer work nor does the a c
Neg,You may say It is However it keeps on breaking But im not not_sure not_about not_that not_Anyway have fun with any car you choose No biggie its only a 10 part that can be easily replaced and you d be correct So there are a ton of reviews about this car saying it is the greatest Well it is But im still here to burst your bubble It has problems I personally own one its a 93 Ford Thunderbird LX with 80 000 miles on it I love it but it doesnt always seem to love me back Recently it has been having problems with the thermostat on the engine The problem is not not_the not_thermostat not_because not_I not_have not_tried not_different not_brands not_many not_with not_lifetime not_warranties not_and not_they not_still not_keep not_on not_breaking not_Still not_no not_biggie not_but not_it not_regulates not_your not_engines not_temp not_and not_you not_dont not_want not_it not_over not_heating not_Also not_every not_once not_in not_a not_while not_the not_spark not_plugs not_will not_miss not_a not_step not_causing not_the not_car not_to not_shake not_Many not_say not_that not_the not_engine not_put not_in not_these not_cars not_is not_the not_worst not_one not_Ford not_makes
Neg,The trunk space is very spacious This car does have excellent pickup handles uphill with ease At 38 000 miles he had a problem with the electrical system When driving in rain or snow the rear end tends to sway while making turns The long roomy look this car has is very appealing but once you own one its not not_worth its looks My husband owns a 1993 Ford Thunderbird and it has caused us nothing but a headache and has put a whole in our bank account The interior is very spacious seats five with enough extra space to seat six even if all the passengers were six feet tall At 40 000 miles he had to have all of the brakes and drums and etc replaced in which was a cost of 1 000 00 at 42 000 miles the head gaskets blew the cost to repair this was 2 500 00 Now there is 52 000 miles and two of the motor mounts need to be replaced the driver side door wont stop chiming when you have the lights on The molding on the drivers side is coming off I know my husband isnt not_to not_blame not_for not_these not_problems not_because not_he not_babies not_his not_cars not_and not_he not_is not_a not_very not_excellent not_driver
Neg,It needed a new set of belts It is so nice to have a vanity mirror again It all began when the vanity mirror fell off the passenger side sun visor Then when that didnt not_fix not_it it needed a new altenator then a distributor cap then spark plugs and eventually an idle speed motor It may sound small but you would be amazed how many people use that thing Shortly after the trunk on the hatchback decided to wimp out and tried to decappatate you at the first moment you werent looking It was truly cherished a car among cars mine I loved the way it handled the sleek body style the gas mileage the way men turned their heads as I drove past but all that came to an end except the head turning tee hee within the first year Two weeks later they deciphered it was nothing more than the battery and I was free to pay the 175 that was not not_covered not_by not_the not_warranty not_Yee not_Haw not_Well not_to not_make not_a not_long not_story not_short not_my not_warranty not_expired and suddenly they figured out exactly why my car was acting funny No crying didnt not_help not_I not_tried not_that not_Reliability not_is not_definitely not_not not_its not_strong not_suit not_Well not_I not_can not_finally not_write not_this not_opinion not_with not_a not_clear not_conscience not_because not_as not_of not_yesterday not_I not_am not_a not_Chevy not_owner not_I not_finally not_got not_my not_00 not_Silverado not_extra not_cab not_step not_side not_and not_will not_not not_have not_to not_worry not_about not_dealing not_with not_Ford not_again not_I not_have not_named not_it not_Maverick not_in not_hopes not_that not_a not_tougher not_name not_might not_make not_for not_a not_tougher not_vehicle It got me to school to work to parties and those were what mattered until suddenly it didnt not_About not_4 not_months not_before not_the not_warranty not_was not_up not_the not_battery not_gauge not_on not_the not_dash not_would not_go not_from not_the not_dead not_center not_to not_oh not_no not_absolutely not_no not_juice not_every not_time not_I not_would not_come not_to not_a not_stop not_Driving not_a not_car not_without not_stopping not_is not_actually not_kind not_of not_difficult not_so not_back not_to not_the not_shop not_Dex not_went The windows rattled every time you drove and my cigarette lighter fizzled out on me Good thing it was all under warranty Right Well some of it Ford took responsibility for and fixed as well as expected I suppose Everything else was cosmetic and wasnt not_included not_in not_the not_warranty not_Great not_Although not_all not_women not_know not_that not_cosmetics not_are not_important ive never considered myself stuck up enough to really care about trivial things Everyone has heard of all these great new innovations that are intended to make our everyday lives more convenient you know disposable diapers disposable cameras disposable contact lenses and I believe this was Fords idea of a disposable car I was so in love with my electric blue 95 Ford Probe SE Sport Edition in the beginning As I drove it off the lot with its 37 miles on it I lovingly named it Poindexter and vowed to wash it on a bi weekly basis The brakes have been done 3 times the last time costing me 1200 because I needed shocks calipers rotors and God knows what else ive needed 4 new rims 3 sets of tires 2 new antenna motors and a partridge in a pear tree and have had to deal with the fact that the material is dangling off the ceiling of my car and my seatbelts wont go back in their slots I have sunk the value of my car into my car in the past year alone Now I am a girl and guys seem to always think I was ripped off but what do you do when you re single and your car is sitting in a shop with the wheels off
Neg,Id heard about Ford cars I bought my 1995 Ford Probe SE because of the sporty look the price and the great things Its only been in the shop 4 times and only for oil changes and new tires My one and only mistake was thinking a car seat would fit in the back WRONG Well not not_totally wrong it WILL fit but not not_comfortably ive had great luck with my Probe so far and I DO love it Its gone over 15 000 miles with no problems And with such a sharp look who wants ice cream and lollipop all over the seats anyway Though reasonably priced mine was around 3500 used you can get a much better deal on a more family type vehicle It gets great gas mileage which IS good for a family but like I said theres just not not_enough not_room not_My not_Probe has more than adequate power rides great and is great to look at too This would be a great car for a single guy or girl but if a family car is what your looking for pass this one by The seats arent the easiest thing to clean hard to get in the grooves should Junior spill some ice cream or drop his lollipop
Neg,The back seat is a joke The shift action is squishy and non responsive The controls are inconvenient and hard to reach The interior materials are cheap plastic and crack very easily This is the worst car that we have ever owned Dont buy It has this mysterious stalling problem at times and the CEL light pops on and off at random times The passenger room is close to non existent my fiancee is 5 5 120lbs and she complains about space The engine sounds like it is going to blow at 3200 RPMs and the acceleration is obscenely non existent All I can say about this car is yuck I cant not_wait not_to not_get not_rid not_of not_it not_Everything not_rattles not_squeaks and knocks Paint is peeling off of the side view mirrors and the hatcback hydraulics are shot It handles OK I have previously owned an Integra GSR and a Nissan Maxima both of which I was sad to see go especially after owning this pile I have even owned a 1990 Subaru Loyale that I liked better than this car and I had to change the alternator in the Subaru 3 times and the tranny once
Neg,I bought a 1995 Probe in 1998 with its sweet lines and smooth ride a black beauty with the spoiler the kind of car all your friends get jealous over So now it sits at the Ford dealership automotive department with a new they discovered after replacing the timing belt that that was not not_the not_cause not_of not_the not_trouble not_525 not_timing not_belt not_with not_a not_suggestion not_that not_it not_might not_be not_the not_throttle not_body not_for not_another not_825 not_or not_so not_If not_anyone not_has not_web not_links not_to not_other not_troubled not_probes not_HELP When I went to pick it up I got about 10 miles away from the shop and it was running hot back to the shop for the Water pump to get fixed THEN after 2 months I once again went to pick it up again and the engine was revving on its own But when it was less than a month after I bought it that it went into the shop to stay from March UNTIL September my friends were less than jealous Going from one mechanic to another with Ford people running tests on it After rebuilding the transmission for about 1800 I got it back in September or so I got to drive it until the end of February and back to the shop again Both times the O D light had come on flashing and over 60 MPH the car would jerk forward but the transaxle as the manual suggests was not not_the not_problem not_Once not_again not_the not_transmission not_was not_worked not_on not_from not_February not_March not_UNTIL not_almost not_June
Neg,The cons Sick of politics The white faced gauges XLT model are quite nice as well Do I like how it looks Does it matter The mini SUV class offers several choices yet still offers you little But what happens when you hit 20 000 miles If I had two words to describe how it looks The V6 XLT I had included all the features I would require minus the MACH stereo The air conditioner works fine although the cooler weather here didnt not_give not_it not_a not_great not_bench not_test These included the V6 engine ABS cruise control an in dash CD player air conditioning remote keyless entry power everything and fog lamps Whats more you can fit up to 63 cubic feet of cargo with the rear seats folded down The in dash CD sound system is decent at best an available MACH system would definitely be on my list of must haves At any rate when I finally received the phone call that I could I was there at a moments notice As for offset crash tests the Escape didnt not_fare not_too not_well not_scoring not_marginal not_one not_step not_above not_poor not_rankings not_are not_as not_follows not_poor not_marginal not_acceptable not_good The Mazda version is sold as the Tribute and has a few cosmetic and option differences with the Escape but essentially the two cars are identical The engine also makes itself known all too often perhaps some more insulation would help Still theres other aspects that should be praised The decision is yours of course I have seen the Escape photographed with more aggressive rims and liked that look much more Here are my impressions EXTERIOR 8 As you may or may not not_know not_Mazda not_had not_a not_pretty not_large not_role not_in not_creating not_the not_design not_for not_this not_vehicle The rear tire isnt not_mounted not_on not_the not_back not_like not_other not_sport not_utes not_in not_its not_class not_which not_saves not_you not_tons not_of not_money not_in not_the not_event not_of not_a not_rear not_collision The 200 hp Duratec V6 is taken from the Ford Taurus in fact the larger of two V6 engines offered in that car The Mazda Tribute also has this engine available On one hand you have the small car based underpowered toys like the Honda CR V and Toyota RAV4 although its been redesigned and on the other side you have a relative behemoth the Nissan Xterra The automatic transmission makes sophisticated shifts and hesitates only a little when the pedal is floored RIDE 7 For an SUV Not bad at all Sure theres more road and wind noise than Id like Like a few of the reviewers here I agree that power does start to weaken as you hit highway speeds but I still would call this vehicle a very competent highway passer This vehicle has a lot going for it The only serious and it is important glitch is the concern for quality I will watch how the Escape performs as the months pass The Escapes base engine is the one found in the Focus 2 0L 130 hp Zetec four I didnt not_try not_it but would strongly recommend the V6 option Ford predicts the V6 model will outsell its four cylinder model Not bad at all for this class Bikes and camping gear should fit comfortably that is what you re considering this vehicle for right I was also quite impressed with the interior room provided for front and rear passengers The 3 0 Duratec V6 that is available on the Escape certainly levels the playing field I have yet to see an SUV in this class that has as much off the line grunt as this one does In fact the Escape Tribute was scheduled to arrive sooner to showrooms but quality concerns delayed things somewhat I have already read of a few recalls on Edmund coms Town Hall where the discussion topic is called Mazda Tribute Ford Escape Problems Not surprisingly there is no low range setting for serious off road treks SAFETY 7 The Escape is equipped with your usual features like airbags and ABS XLT and upward I definitely would chalk some points up on the Escapes behalf as far as braking is concerned There is very little body lean during everyday driving I took a turnaround curve at a speed that I thought was too fast initially until I realized that the Escape was holding up admirably Braking is very impressive once again car like All for a price of around 22 000 I feel this is a very appealing value quotient that is being offered here especially considering the amount of power that the V6 engine provides THE VERDICT WHY MUST I ALWAYS BE THE ONE WHOs NOT POLITICALLY CORRECT Id say actively pedestrian I prefer the Mazda Tributes exterior to this one it has more of an elegant flair to it that I find appealing INTERIOR 7 Okay lets hit on the pros here the dash is a user friendly design with everything readable and within reach Any response to that Will the media clamor to call me a liar I think not not_Why Because the Escape has raised the bar on this class and other car manufacturers had better fall in line quick Still theres a caveat and its no less important to consider before going out and buying this vehicle Or 40 000 miles ive been studying cars for a long time and be careful is all I have to say VALUE 9 When it comes to dollars and cents the Escape makes plenty of sense I made a rhyme happens all the time can I borrow a dime In fact Id say that no other SUV in this class really sizes up well with the Escape in this category save for the Honda CR V There are plenty of very useable cubbies and pockets for you to store your stuff too including two nicely sized cup holders that dont not_get not_in not_the not_way not_of not_things After this election year who wouldnt

irregularities HANDLING 8 Out of the mini SUVs that ive driven the Escape is certainly one of the best compromises of ride and handling No I wouldnt not_call not_it not_cat not_like not_but not_easily not_car not_like In my opinion the only compromise in this class was the Suzuki Grand Vitara until now Many reviews of the Escape on this site describing test drives came out when the vehicle just came out This made little sense to me because a glitch in the vehicles steering forced dealers not not_to not_allow not_the not_car not_for not_test not_driving not_purposes not_in not_my not_city not_at not_least In other crash tests performed by the NHTSA the Escape did better Front driver five stars Front passenger four stars Front side impact five stars Rear side impact five stars Rollover rating three stars RELIABILITY 5 Ahh heres the caveat I alluded to in the beginning you thought I had forgot didnt not_you not_I not_have not_always not_always not_been not_wary not_of not_an not_introductory not_model not_car not_and not_I not_urge not_you not_to not_consider not_that not_yourself Oh theres the minor things the column shifter felt strange and ambiguous kind of like one found on an 80s Buick station wagon if that makes any sense I didnt not_find not_the not_seats not_particularly not_comfortable although the material did seem like it could stand up to some abuse Perhaps the available leather option would help things out a bit no models on the lot had the option so I couldnt try it But those are minor things after all Theres major problems too though If and when I am proven wrong I will change my tune faster than Al Gore changes his personality or George W Bush can say subliminal For now however the caveat stands as pretty stong opposition to the new SUV

construction which automatically lands this vehicle as more of a road cruiser than off road warrior Still the vast majority of drivers out there are going for image and or carrying capacity so not not_too many will complain about that The Escape is what Ford needed to enter the small SUV fray Its the smallest SUV in its model line and is just a little shorter than a Honda CR V It sits on 16 Firestone Wilderness HT tires no cause for alarm here and has a ground clearance of almost eight inches which make it a decent beach cruiser or very lite off roader In fact further research indicated that the Escape stops better than some cars Car and Driver made the Escape stop in only 171 feet from 70 mph 0 mph which is the best they said they had seen in a production SUV Wow The Escape is primarily front wheel drive although it does send power to the rear wheels if it detects any slippage Just my luck it was raining the day of my drive and although the Control Trac II AWD system probably engaged during the course of the day I never noticed it There is by the way a 4WD switch for full time 4WD which I did use later The most glaring fault of the interior is quality Even if we were to ignore the fact that hard plastic abounds in this SUV I guess its to be expected it was very hard for me to ignore the fact that the bottom door panels were coming off and I could see the metal underneath Equally hard to ignore was the tinny clang sound the doors made when I shut them a far cry from the Suzuki Grand Vitaras thud A small rattle seemed to be coming from the front of the dash on the passenger side when the road got a little bumpy ENGINE 10 When I reviewed the Suzuki Grand Vitara I said it had an engine that was the perfect size for its class Well I was wrong
Neg,The dashboard styling is disappointing generic The first time ive dealt with a Los Angeles area The exterior design is efficient looking though not not_as not_stylish as the Toyota Rav4 This is apparently a derivation of the V6 used in the Taurus Dealer network The leather seats are not not_as not_firm not_contoured not_or not_supportive not_as not_the not_fabric not_seats not_in not_the not_Explorer not_Sport In the forest green ive had people mistake the Escape for the new Rover Freelander The Interior This is the first rational sized SUV and it made me rethink what city dwellers really need in an SUV The Escape is a thoroughly modern SUV well proportioned with a large interior it matches or betters the Explorer in comfort in almost every area Having recently suffered through a disastrous experience with a 2001 Ford Explorer Sport I ended up in an Escape XLT which I thought would ultimately be a better choice The V6 engine is smooth and torquey though not not_much not_better not_than not_the not_Explorer not_V6 not_for not_gas not_mileage not_in not_the not_city not_Highway not_driving not_seems not_to not_yield not_better not_mileage not_than not_the not_Explorer In fact if you compare the specs the Escape interior is almost identical to the larger Explorer Ergonomics are good everywhere else gauges are the currently trendy white with black markings With the number of recalls on the Escape ive received 3 so far the dealer network should be helluvalot more supportive to make sure that these cars are 100 Given the Firestone debacle with the Explorer the Escape should be job one Ford dealer I was mortified at the poor support in the area of post sales After taking the Escape off the lot I spent the first weekend documenting a few things that needed to be tightened fixed or touched up And recently the rear window wiper motor failed as well Also disappointing was that the Escape didnt not_have not_the not_same not_back not_lit not_switches not_as not_the not_Explorer not_has not_Power not_windows not_alone not_should not_be not_back not_lit not_at not_night not_The not_Explorer not_also not_had not_puddle not_lamps not_which not_were not_very not_handy not_Engine The seats could be more supportive especially given what the car can do With all the talk about SUV rollover the Escape startles traffic light racers with its speed and handling capabilities Surprisingly the turning circle is bigger than the Explorer so U turns end up being 3 pts Overall When i brought the vehicle back you would have thought I had asked them for their livers I tried a different dealer who surprised me by telling me to go back to the dealer I bought the car from Hardly a unified Ford team Recalls The dash seems to be made of a cheap hard shell plastic as opposed to the cushioned dash of the Explorer I also have a wonderful 6 CD sound system that reminds me of the Mach 460 system in the Mustang Unfortunately on a very hot day the CD system mysteriously failed for the afternoon And whoever designed the automatic gear shifter arm should be shot because one cant not_see not_the not_defrost not_button not_Power not_outlets not_are not_not not_designed not_for not_cell not_phones not_to not_be not_used not_and not_plugged not_in not_they not_are not_too not_low not_And not_if not_you not_use not_a not_speaker not_cell not_phone not_cradle not_the not_hockey not_stick not_of not_a not_shifter not_will not_get not_in not_the not_way not_Interior not_space not_for not_4 not_passengers not_is not_very not_good not_fine not_for not_5 When you get a recall the Ford dealers dont not_seem not_to not_see not_how not_inconvenient not_it not_is not_to not_take not_the not_car not_in not_in not_the not_morning not_get not_a not_ride not_to not_work not_get not_a not_ride not_back not_to not_the not_dealership not_Driving not_The not_Escape not_is not_a not_pleasure not_to not_drive not_in not_the not_city not_and not_on not_the not_highway not_Great not_pick not_up not_a not_commanding not_view not_of not_the not_road and yet environmentally friendly than the giant Expeditions or Excursions I see Very easy to park The Escape is a nice compromise but in its first year iffy quality poor dealer support and poor gas mileage would make me choose something else or wait another year The Escape should be a very good car by next year once all the bugs and recalls are ironed out Dont forget this is Mazda engineering the Mazda twin is called the Tribute im looking at the PT Cruiser for my next car see my review because its size and proportions fit my needs the styling is a lot more interesting than the Escape the interior is a lot more innovative and the bad Ford dealer experiences finished off my 16 year loyalty to the make
Neg,That is alot of wind drag The seat belt cover on the pillar is cracked and fell off The interior light is horrible Instruments are fine but the dome light stinks You have to turn it on with a switch ON the light The wind and tire noise not not_to not_mention the squeaking rear hatch window combo is horrible Try turning on the recirculating AC you hear this big WAP from the HVAC system nice touch Warranty repairs Also why does the window lockout switch also lockout the driver from controlling these windows CHEAP Front seats need armrests My seat panels next to the center console on the seat frame are warped so badly that they will not not_stay not_in not_place not_they not_pop not_off not_on not_one not_side Try a simple dome light switch on the IP Ford Also hardly any of the door heaven forbid the steering wheel controls are lit I believe the only switch lit is the drivers window My XLS has a center console that is basically flat I think the XLT has a higher console that can be used for an armrest Needs a rear cargo net too NOISE You have to turn up the radio so much that once you stop it is blaring I try to use my heads free cell phone headset and cant not_because not_there not_is not_too not_much not_noise Ok it is on but 90 of its light goes to the back and when you turn it off you have to set the switch in the middle door position otherwise it is off regardless of opening doors etc Trying doing that while driving and you think cell phones are dangerous I was excited to get this vehicle as my next company lease vehicle as I thought the styling was good and offered utility in a better package Initial impressions were good as they were based on the engine performance and handling Both are excellent and it went pretty well in serious snowfall as well As I lived with it some interior CHEAP details started showing up I know the plastic world and Ford has used the cheapest plastics possible on this interior My steering started screaming and whining so the dealer replaced the entire rack and 2 days later the tensioner idler pulley exploded losing all belt driven accessories which includes the power steering and required a roadside tow I didnt not_know not_the not_problem not_at not_first not_and not_losing not_steering not_assist not_2 not_days not_after not_they not_replaced not_the not_rack not_is not_a not_bit not_disconcerting not_OH and I complained about the squeaky rear hatch and the dealerships remedy was to remove the dealership license plate frame and charge my lease co 85 Which did nothing for the squeak of course Summary Again nice styling nice engine nice handling nothing else is nice Noisey quality problems and obviously cheap on the interior I never get better than 18mpg 3 0L V6 Coworkers get 24 with the same engine in their Taurus
Neg,The offroading abilities of this car are average When I was in the market for a new SUV the new 2001 models were just coming onto the market There are few things I love about this vehicle although the things I do like are major The negative thing about this is that it limits your cargo room which I must say is extremely limited In conclusion the Escape is OK for a person on the market for the average in compact SUVs and it is more of a car anyway It has front and rear independent suspension allowing for a nice ride on the street but sometimes not not_the not_best not_choice for offroading However the car is short The escape is almost undoubtedly safe as Fords reputation goes Now for the driving The Escapes steering is not not_quite not_that not_of not_a not_BMW but its ok The pickup however is above average DO NOT BUY THE 4 CYLINDER ENGINE It is unbelievably slow and it is pitiful that Ford would even try to get people to buy it The more fitting SUV for this size is the Mazda Tribute the Escapes twin I prefer the tighter suspension and quasi nicer interior Consider it over the Escape
Neg,The seats are not not_particularly not_comfortable It has good power reasonable handling and for an SUV good gas mileage I recently rented one for 5 days to go skiing up in Lake Tahoe The system has an Auto 4x4 mode Neither system worked I could not not_discern not_a not_difference On the road the car you ll see why I call it a car performs well The 4x4 system doesnt make sense im in 6 of snow a bit off to the side of the road Ok that coupled with the questionable reliability I think that you get what you pay for I got pulled out by a Toyota 4 Runner The wheels that have traction dont not_want not_to not_move not_while not_the not_wheels not_that not_slip not_continue not_to not_slip not_Its not_as not_if not_the not_system not_only not_powers not_the not_wheels not_that not_have not_the not_least not_amount not_of not_grip If theres a little snow on the road it seems to do fine I didnt not_need not_to not_chain not_up not_My not_primary not_complaint is that this so called 4x4 performs poorly when it gets a little deeper I got stuck My next vehicle or perhaps a Pathfinder I was also considering a Honda CR V but I suspect many of these wannabe 4wd systems will eventually leave me out in the cold Granted I know real 4WD vehicles will also high center and get stuck but my situation was not not_even not_close
Neg,She says They re ugly Looking through the review mirror its hard to see lower objects No way I cant not_drive not_a not_minivan not_im not_not not_the not_minivan not_type There was also a significant amount of body roll on tighter turns The headlights are standard no metallic effects or any hints of stylization However the higher ground clearance can make this space less convenient to use The leather captains chairs in the front were comfortable but got really hot in the sun So another half of a Saturday down the drain but with a better insight on the Excursion It can be as low as even 7 with the 1st and 2nd captains chair option Id like the gray too much in something this size the interior would seem too barren Get up and go power is just not there even with the V10 making for a sluggish ride The Excursion has the front of the Ford F 250 and up series the front end of a work truck and its not not_attractive Other color options include aspen green hunter green with yellow hints black mineral gray flat silver white red true blue light navy and wedgewood blue lighter blue Up front there are four cup holders that would hold just about any size cup and they re easy to reach There are two interior color options gray and beige this one had beige that looked nice and warm I dont not_think You can just lift the glass to load objects but the height almost forces you to heave them in over the tailgate Safety And that is that for these type of trips picking it up yourself can be more time work and money than simply paying to have it delivered But they did not not_improve not_it not_the not_grille not_is not_big not_and not_blank not_looking not_with not_no not_crossbars not_just not_the not_blue not_oval not_in not_the not_center not_creating not_a not_lot not_of not_negative not_space not_on not_the not_front The Excursion seems to be targeted to the larger loads and more industrial business uses hence the narrow targeted audience The Excursion was introduced in 2000 and sales have been suffering since so much so that Ford had to cut production in half in 2001 i Performance Power and Handling The 3rd row of seats is fairly easy to remove just flip them forward and pull a bar at the rear to slide them back i Exterior Looks and Features The front grille is larger and sticks up higher than the head lights I think Ford got this design from Dodge shortly after the RAM series were redesigned with a similar grille The instrument cluster is nothing to get excited about its very plain and dated looking with white on black gauges black plastic and a steering wheel that was a strange shade of brown The Excursion can hold up to 9 passengers if you get the 3 bench rows seating option this ones body count was only at 8 with two captains chairs in the front and 2nd and 3rd rows being benches The 3rd row seemed roomier than the Denali but still lacked a little in leg room for my 6 ft tall frame and my head was still close to the roof and could possibly hit on a big bump But hey if you paint it yellow with black stripes down the side maybe the county will help pay you to drive it It was able to move but acceleration was minimal and not not_exciting dont not_expect not_much not_when not_passing not_on not_the not_highway this engine is designed to pull a lot of weight but not not_fast This model has the 6 8L V10 with 310 HP but you can also get a 5 4L V8 with 255 HP or 7 3L V8 Diesel with 250 HP For a V10 I was not not_impressed not_with not_the not_power not_maybe not_I not_was not_expecting not_too not_much The front side windows have a gap in the front that slopes down maybe for better visibility but I did not not_find not_how not_this not_helped not_A not_sad not_thing not_about not_the not_one not_I not_borrowed not_it not_had not_been not_keyed not_twice not_on not_the not_drivers not_side Also I can see where loading kids might not not_be not_as not_easy not_as not_a not_van not_or not_a not_minivan not_because not_of not_the not_added not_height and the extra work to get to the 3rd row of seats and interior space is only slightly better that a minivan very slightly This is a utility vehicle with a lot of towing power but pricey for something used for occasional uses and pricey to drive all the time I would only recommend it for people towing all the time like for maybe a horse business of some sort or landscaping business The Excursion is about 6 4 to 6 7 ft tall depending on if it has 4WD or not not_and not_the not_added not_height not_makes not_seeing not_over not_traffic not_nice not_like not_the not_Denali not_I not_drove but I found lower visibility to be a problem making it hard to see lower objects The Excursion has a 44 gallon gas tank and recommends a minimum of 87 octane fuel I had to put 32 gallons into it before returning it costing me 49 60 to fill it from empty to full would cost about 68 20 at current prices in my area The reason I give this model such a low rating is because it has such a limited targeted audience very expensive for a truck that may not not_be not_used not_on not_a not_regular not_basis has terrible gas mileage worse than many in its class except the diesel model and is not not_fun not_to not_drive It can tow up to 11 000 lbs with the V10 but despite the Dumbo like side view mirrors this elephant would not not_fly not_I not_think

not_of not_power not_to not_move not_itself Shortly after getting in and taking off I started to despise the visibility issues with the Excursion and found myself constantly leaning forward and twisting around to double check everything getting a strange kink in my neck Its hard to get used to the larger front end and how close it is to other objects This model had the optional reverse sensor that beeps when you get too anything close while backing up like a house Parking the Excursion was a hideous nightmare im sure many people already figured this The Excursion is about 19 ft long and about 6 7 ft wide the average parking spot is only 18 ft long some less The power lock and window switches were easy to reach and seemed well laid out Power adjustable pedals for different sized drivers is an option this model had This model had the optional DVD entertainment system for the 2nd and 3rd rows but I didnt not_get not_a not_chance not_to not_play not_with not_it not_Remote not_keyless not_entry not_is not_standard not_on not_all not_models The Excursion comes with 2 front airbags and 3 point safety seat belts no safe canopy system like the Expedition but it does have side impact beams Reading other reviews it seems everyone mentions safety as being a pro for the Excursion but I cant not_find not_safety not_ratings not_for not_the not_2000 not_2001 not_2002 not_or not_the not_2003 not_model not_not not_on not_NHTSA not_or not_IIHS This is essentially an F 250 truck without the rugged bed and only major strengths are towing towing and uh towing Did I mention towing But keep in mind many minivans and smaller SUVs can tow usually between 3 000 to 4 500 lbs enough to accommodate many boats and trailers If 4WD is your primary need maybe for snowy weather look into a smaller more nimble SUV truck or sport wagon again you ll save money and have more fun driving it The Excursion tried to combine all these uses in a big expensive package with mediocre less efficient and less usable results However larger bumps sent a sharp jolt through the Excursion and made the vehicle continued to sway afterwards something I also noticed in the Denali With the back end weighed down I was noticing every bump in the road and feeling many clunks making for a bumpy ride I was a little disappointed by this expecting something this size to handle smoother This angered

would recommend looking for a good deal on one used to have around when you need it If you need convenient space look into a minivan that has equal room and is easier to drive cheaper and gets better gas mileage Also the large side view mirrors stick out very far from the sides making me think of Dumbo looking at the Excursion from the front end The mirrors also made me nervous parking because of the extra width to the truck From the side the Excursion looks very boxy it has no sexy lines or curves just an enormous wall Getting two tone paint helps this a little but not not_much The owners

not not_like not_the not_all not_button not_climate not_control not_it not_seemed not_awkward not_to not_use compared to the large knob based systems I couldnt reach over and easily make adjustments while driving The ground clearance is 8 1 inches but it seemed a lot higher to me while loading the back maybe even higher than the Denali making it harder to load heavy objects I realize the back opens up in 3 parts because of the size but I still hate it To open the back first the window has to be flipped up then the lower tailgate is in two doors that swing out on either side Again making it

options many owners report around 17 MPG and a max of 24 MPG Maneuverability is a big problem with the Excursion for making U turns I found it needed at least four lanes Its also a challenge to park

uglier I thought her views were a little uh off considering they dont not_tow not_anything not_and not_never not_go not_off not_road but thought an Excursion would be better than a minivan Well it certainly costs more Problem is they re die hard Ford fans i i and theres not not_much in the minivan or car selection from them now Matter of fact its predicted that by 2005 Ford will only sell

having a bigger vehicle is nice I remember we had a large Dodge van that only came out of the side yard for family trips and or towing the boat my parents used their smaller cars for commuting to work

front of it the visibility issues werent helping it took 3 tries and a small portion of my sanity Also its tricky to park next to other vehicles close to its size with those side mirrors that stick out so far Its important when parking it to make sure its centered in the spot to reduce the risk of it getting hit by the door of the car next to it I found it was always close to the lot lines making something like this easy to happen i Interior Looks and Features Overall interior space on the Excursion is close to the Honda Odyssey at 146 4 cubic feet behind the first row 100 7 cubic feet behind the 2nd and 48 cubic feet behind the 3rd Well my landscaping saga continues as I venture to get stonewall siding and this time I got to borrow a 2003 Ford Excursion to get the siding You would

Neg,We needed space plain and simple So why did we buy this vehicle The ride is harsh and not not_refined at all We ll wait for the Infinity version of that one Which is generous for a mid size but not not_for not_a not_full not_size not_SUV The 2nd row leg room is no better than that of our Acura MDX In fact the Acura Navi has more info on one dvd in letterbox format The handling is very heavy and the engine is very noisy when accelerating The independent suspension does NOT make a difference on vehicle stability nor does it soften the ride On long road trips with our two boys and our dog we wanted a substantial vehicle under our seats The storage in the cabin is limited with very narrow door pockets no sunglass holder nor a two tiered console storage system The disks do not not_have not_the not_level not_of not_detail not_that not_you not_would not_expect not_with not_a not_multiple not_dvd not_system The Expedition interior materials and controls are of poor quality and feel cheap overall including the Special Eddie Bauer leather and carpeting The 2nd row captains chairs are narrow cheap and shallow We wish that Acura would make a bigger granddaddy to the MDX which we feel is the best value in an SUV on the market So that leaves the Yukon Denali XL which was nearly as costly as the Cadillac and the Suburban which is im sorry to say just a cheap Chevy The navigation system is outdated using multiple disks instead of one DVD for the whole country the screen is tiny and not not_letterbox which is easier to read To get almost as much rear storage room in the Sequoia you have to lift and remove their heavy bulky third row seats and then you are seatless when you get to your destination The Escalade Extended was WAY too much money for not not_much not_value and its navi was outdated as well The Navigator had less room and a poorly designed cabin with the shift taking up needed room on the console and no loose storage room The Expedition has a fold flat rear seat which is comfortable for an adult or two or three The Nissan Armada did not not_have not_the not_curb not_appeal not_nor not_the not_interior not_space not_of not_the not_Expedition not_and not_the not_large not_engine not_and not_drive not_train not_are not_in not_untested not_waters not_for not_Nissan We bought an 04 Eddie Bauer hoping it would have the refinements to make owning a large SUV tolerable Wrong For a list price of 48 000 you re better off buying a fully tricked out Toyota Sequoia and still have plenty of money left to take a family vacation And if you get an aftermarket rear entertainment system they put the play unit in the console which already houses the multi CD changer which is out dated requiring you to load into a multi cassette instead of directly into the dashboard unit very hard to change CDs while on the move taking up what little room you have to begin with The vehicle is not not_outfitted not_to not_take not_on not_Satellite not_Radio not_either
Neg,Introduction He says Then the unimaginable happened My recommendations are underdrive pullies and new heads This thing is faster than the Ford Mustang Cobra This is one up on the 454SS It was a lot more comfortable than I was expecting Thats all folks I cant not_think not_of not_a not_single not_other not_pro not_Neutral No all out acceleration no tire spinning but to tell the truth she surprised me The drive I didnt not_treat not_this not_truck not_like not_I not_should not_have not_for not_this not_article The ride was better than in the other F 150 ive driven but still not not_as not_soft as a 454SS The truck I drove had a bench seat I think you can also get sport bucket seats If you re really interested in sport trucks I have written an article on the 454SS My recommendation avoid the Lightening Or just stick a real engine in there After talking to an owner the only thing he was able to do to his was cosmetic junk The sales guy walks up and starts talking about how great a truck it is Not wanting to damage my chances I agreed with him The other F 150 I have experience in was very uncomfortable this one I felt like I could spend the whole day in and be fine If you just want to go fast and dont not_care if its a truck get a Camaro SS or Cobra Mustang Same price better handling better gas mileage more aftermarket If you use it to tow just not a lot the exhaust is in front of the tire so you wont get carbon all over your trailer You d never believe it Id never believe it I decided to stop by the Ford dealer to take a look at this POS F 150 and compare it to the 454SS The 454SS is a much better looking truck even the generation one Lightenings are better looking You ll never get it to compete on the road tracks against the Cobra at least not not_in not_a not_reasonable not_price not_range It ll run 0 60 in 5 9 seconds and the 1 4 mile in 13 6 right off the lot It really helps that she has a big Vortec Blower under the hood The Special Vehicle Team SVT did a wonderful job pulling every last pony pound of torque out of the 5 4 liter V8 Your problem is that you ll have a heck of a time getting the truck going faster than 13 6 100 mph in the quarter mile The CD player was pretty nice I brought along a Bon Jovi song to test it out since ive heard good things about it I wasnt not_disappointed not_the not_bass not_was not_good not_for not_stock and the four speakers filled the interior nicely One large selling point for the 454SS was that it will easily tow 10 000 lbs With the Lightening you ll be able to tow half that Which is less than thes 10 Extreme with 3 04 smallest rear end Overall Id take a 454SS anyday The automatic transmission is ridiculous A sports car or truck has to have a manual transmission option Otherwise it is slow How about some gas mileage here Sure its not not_as not_bad as her arch rival the 454SS but it is awfully low at 14 miles per gallon Especially with that little engine So you wanna drive it I really had no reason to but why not not_This not_offer was crazy because im an 18 year old kid driving a Blazer with a brand new paint job that could maybe sell for 5 000 tops the Lightening was sticker priced at over 32 000 The entire time I was driving the truck it kept occurring to me that it was as fast as it was going to get I took her around the city a little bit then a short sprint on the highway I wouldnt not_buy not_one not_even not_if not_I not_had not_the not_cash not_Pros You can get the Chevy for way less and for a little bit of money you can really get that big block moving The Lightening is pretty much torqued on to death and you wont get too much more speed out of it You ll have a little more trouble finding a 454SS but price difference and likeability will be much greater One thing that is nice in the Lightening that is unneeded that should be in the 454SS is a tachometer Cons First of all the obvious opinion I think this truck is uglier than sin Its too big to be as low as it is It looks clumsy
Neg,For years I had heard favorable things about the Ford Taurus You can also adjust the radio volume using another button near the steering wheel But the Taurus has lots of annoying design shortcomings that aggravate me daily But the car is just too narrow to comfortably fit 3 adults in either front or rear This feature is great to have but once again Ford engineers have screwed it up So I took advantage of the opportunity to replace my 84 Reliant wagon with a 1995 Taurus wagon about six months ago In contrast the 1995 Taurus built 3 years after my Buick uses a ridiculous split front armrest thus wasting the space other manufacturers have cleverly exploited for storage The car has been reliable handles well for me im no cowboy on the road though and I really like the lockable compartment built into the floor of the rear cargo area My oldest car is now a 1992 Buick LeSabre I mention this only because in that car the front arm rest doubles as a storage area for tapes change and has a cupholder for two cups For starters after locking the car with the electric door locks all you need do to open the car door is use the handle no need to actually unlock the door Once the radio is on there is a convenient button located near the steering wheel that allows you to scan previously programmed channels in the current frequency band either AM FM1 or FM2 It also means after I exit the car from the drivers side if I want to access another car door to remove something I have to remember to unlock ALL the doors before exiting the car The radio sound is of decent quality but I hate radios with all pushbuttons since you actually have to take your eyes off the road in order to turn the radio on or change bands A raised circular power volume knob would increase operability for this radio immensely This feature places children or others such as my aged mother in peril since you need not not_actually not_unlock not_a not_door not_in not_order not_to not_open not_it not_There not_may not_be not_childproof not_locks not_for not_the not_rear not_doors not_I not_havent not_checked not_that not_out not_since not_I not_dont not_transport not_young not_children You also cant not_remove not_the not_cup not_or not_replace not_it not_without not_actually not_looking not_at not_the not_cupholder not_once not_again not_limiting not_its not_usefulness not_im not_not not_sure not_how not_to not_characterize not_the not_interior not_passenger not_space not_of not_the not_Taurus not_Two not_adults not_can not_fit not_comfortably not_in not_front not_and not_two not_adults not_plus not_a not_child not_will not_fit not_comfortably not_in not_the not_rear However the wagon does have a third seat that can be popped up from the floor of the rear cargo area so in principle you can cram 8 occupants into the vehicle although not not_very not_comfortably in my opinion Gas mileage with the car with mileage approximately evenly split between highway and city driving is about 20 miles per gallon Oh there is indeed a cup holder that can be pulled out from the dashboard But its placement limits the size of the cups that can be placed there A 20 oz cup of hot coffee must be mildly distorted and angled to fit in the cup holder and more than once the cup has opened and spilled its contents upon removal The radio also seems to be much more susceptible to outside electrical interference than the radios in any of my other cars Buick Olds and Chevy forcing me to actually turn the radio off sometimes on my way to work Road noise also competes with the radio much more so than in my other cars I have a power seat with the car The release doesnt actually pop the cover by the way It only releases it Thus gas station attendants will stand there yelling at me or motioning at me to pop the gas tank release when ive already done so To be fair to Ford I did buy the car used and maybe in a new car the gas tank cover does actually pop open when you hit the release button There is very little space between the left side of the seat near the floor and the car door Located in that small space are the power seat controls the rear gate release and the gas tank cover release Needless to say everytime I reach for the gas tank cover release I hit the power seat buttons moving the seat in some unpredictable way To avoid this I always open the car door just to release the gas cap cover The Taurus wagon has both a rear defrost button and a rear windshield wiper button Unfortunately the rear defrost control is not not_located not_with not_the not_other not_heater not_and not_air not_conditioning not_controls not_and not_its not_actually not_hidden not_from not_my not_view not_when not_im not_seated not_in not_the not_drivers not_seat so ive always got to hunt for it when I want it The rear windshield washer button is also obscured by the steering wheel another annoyance Overall im satisfied with the Taurus but the poor human engineering will keep me from buying one again

Neg,Then theres the drink holder It waits a few more seconds It makes a few half hearted chugs As you can tell im not not_a not_big not_fan not_of not_the not_Taurus now It has a good safety record for collisions room to sit five people and a good sized trunk I would like to start with a disclaimer I got my 95 Ford Taurus used from Car Max back in early 1999 There are handy little buttons beside the steering wheel that allow you to search for the radio station you want You re trying to merge onto a major interstate traffic is going about 60 mph your merge lane is going about 20 mph Ah the glorious drink holder Only certain medium coffee cups fit A Coke can will slide right through so I use the cigarette lighter thing under the cup holder to support cans of Coke at an awkward angle It heats up nice and quickly in the winter largely I suspect because the engine seems to kick out a lot of heat that the car cant not_use What does your Taurus do I ll tell you what mine does it sits there and ponders life existence and the raising costs of tea in Nepal while I slam my foot into the accelerator By the way if your rear light cracks you have to get the entire casing replaced including the part behind the bulb and it ll set you back over 100 Seemed silly to me when it was just a bit of red plastic that had been cracked The poor dudes changing my burned out lights took two hours no kidding because they had to unscrew strange bits of metal hiding the screws for the actual lights and they had to do so at a really odd angle basically bruising their fingers Glad I didnt not_even not_try not_to not_change not_those not_things not_myself They said there were metal shavings in the AC So I gave up and now sweat my way through D C area summers Brakes Had to be fully replaced another 1000 gone Fan belt again Whats with the fan belt Another 250 gone Aside from the more costly aspects of 95 Taurus ownership the car is rife with smaller annoyances It had 50 000 miles on it or so the odometer claimed Only the gods know what the prior owners did to it With that in mind I bring you the Saga Of The Used 1995 Taurus That My Father Bought Me Because Of The Safety Record Lets start of with acceleration my first pet peeve about this car It got harder and harder to get the buttons to respond in the first year of ownership and the main search one just eventually stopped responding at all So if I bang on the buttons really really hard I can still pull up preselected stations but no chance now of scanning the radio without leaning way over the the out of reach radio O K im short but it still seems set awfully far left If you get a large cup of coffee to start the day you ll have to bend it at an angle and wrestle it out if you want a sip while driving Gauranteed you ll slosh some on your cassette player or the front seat I think the designers had major phobias about people who drink coffee and drive so they were trying to discourage the practice Last but not not_least are the lights if your front lights burn out and theres someone at a place like Jiffy Lube you really hate take it to them to get the lights changed Then only then does it condescend to speed up a bit for you ive had some very very close calls trying merge or get out of the way of a nut so driver due to the bad acceleration Basically you re more than fine if you re already doing speed of traffic and need to pass but if you need to get put on thirty to forty miles fast make sure the oncoming vehicle has a gap of roughly a mile for you to merge into No joke Continuing the front seat seems to be designed for and by chimps Normal sized humans end up having to bend their heads back at a strange angle to use the head rest and the way the seats are curved is almost exactly the wrong angle for my back O K lets move on to cost of repairs Admittedly I bought my favorite little piece of automative engineering used but still heres a list of some of the repairs ive had to have in the past three years not not_including not_the not_3000 not_mile not_oil not_changes not_I not_do not_religiously not_and not_all not_that not_jazz not_Water not_pump not_fan not_belt not_over not_500 but it was in the middle of a snowstorm and the mechanic had me over a barrel Transmission a week after the snowstorm about 1 000 AC Went dead towards end of first summer of ownership spent 350 Went dead again trusted mechanic still couldnt fix it after giving me two free visits Ford Dealership said they might keyword might be able to fix it for 1200
Neg,The term slushbox never seemed more appropriate The interior is to its credit pretty comfortable At the time the car was in excellent condition with low mileage and a clean interior My family bought a 1995 Ford Taurus GL sedan back in 96 when the car was only a year old The engine has lost most of its pickup what little it had in the first place and the fuel mileage has dropped The transmissions shifting has gotten even sloppier if such a thing is possible and the seats have lost most of their comfort All in all if you re going to buy this vehicle do yourself a favor and find one with a better trim level The entire car is tan Not that theres anything wrong with the paint in fact the paint quality is quite good its just so drab The engine is mated to the standard transmission in this case an electronically controlled 4 speed automatic with overdrive Ford transmissions are not not_known not_for not_their not_crisp not_shifts and this one is no exception However 4 years later the hands of time have taken their toll Our Taurus is now pushing 100 000 miles and the car is definitely showing its age and then some This cars one asset is that its invisible in traffic Unfortunately its also invisible in the parking lot especially considering that 95 if I remember correctly was the year Ford Taurus out sold every other passenger car in the States Thank God they werent all tan The front split bench seat is comfortable but my tastes lean more toward buckets I also prefer a floor mounted shifter as opposed to this models column mounted shifter but it wasnt not_my not_choice not_so not_im not_stuck not_with not_it not_As not_ive not_said not_the not_car not_is not_showing not_its not_age This particular model is a bare bones vehicle I think it may have once been part of a rental fleet Power is delivered by a wimpy 3 0L V6 which even when new produced a measly 140 horsepower Most mid size sedans of its time easily eclipsed its power output Now five years later it seems even weaker than before
Neg,The Taurus Line of vehicles started in 1989 the concept was borrowed from the German auto makers Design a car that was ergonomically correct and customer appealing inside while being fuel efficient and aerodynamic on the outside This car had a great start in the eyes of the American consumer Taurus had been the number 1 selling vehicle in the United States for 5 years and customers loved its pre Euro body shape that was very very slippery and fuel efficient It drove and looked like a family sedan but had all the excitement and and appeal of a fuel efficient sports car I still own the 1989s H O and still fully enjoy driving it By the way this article was written by a single man with no children I pray that Ford and Yamaha motors will reunite for one more encore 2001s H O The newer Taurus lacks passion in the driving and performance departments But sad to say Ford has lost site of the Target the American consumers love of driving and appeal for performance and speed in a vehicle I must admit I own a 1989 Tauruss H O and in my biased opinion Ford should have continued along this line of thought A family sedan that drives like a sports car The 1989 Tauruss H O was a collaboration between Ford and Yamaha motors that met the theme
Neg,Seating is average yet again falls short of the competition The 4 speed fully automatic transmission coupled to this engine only makes accelerating problems worse There are also many storage compartments throughout the cabin i Exterior Innovation i This system also falls short in the clarity department and received terrible FM reception while driving through local mountain valleys The quality of the leather actually reminded me of the poor leather seating in my a href content 48232304260 1989 Mercury Sable a My SES tester was equipped with optional front bucket plastic feeling leather seats with a floor auto shifter and console betwixt the driver and passenger The interior of the 2002 Taurus SES is a mixed bag While the car possesses many strong attributes this car also has its obvious weak points The loss of the dual exhaust system on the Duratec equipped models just makes it that much harder for this car to look sporty Price Reliability Warranty i This has been the norm for these cars for some years now and I am now getting complaints that the 99 models are having reliability problems The EPA is 20 27 which is lower than the larger less sophisticated 3 8 OHV engined Chevrolet Impala Fuel Economy gov has more info on EPA ratings i Interior Accommodation i The interior vs its recent predecessors is much more desirable yet still remains cheap looking and the materials are still not not_up not_to not_par For example the dash seems dated cluttered and uninteresting The exterior of the 2002 Ford Taurus while once looking like what many thought looked like a jelly bean back in 86 than a space ship in 96 has now joined the world of Plain Jane automotive design The rear seats are made of the same cheap material which offers a 60 40 split configuration Like all Ford Tauruses room remains very good front and rear passengers will enjoy more than enough room for long trips Storage is also good Tons of room for a family of 5s weeks worth of groceries There are large see through effect head lamps and angled tail lamps but this car still looks like every car you see on the Hertz rental car lot The 16 5 spoke alloy rims and optional spoiler do add some sport to this sedan but still looks every bit the part of a car that was made to get lost in traffic The wagon is offered in SE and SEL trim 2 powerplants are also available All trims besides the SEL come standard with the reliable yet anemic OHV 3 0 Vulcan V6 while a DOHC Duratec 3 0 V6 is standard on the SEL and is an option on the lesser trim lines Transmissions include a standard clunky unrefined 4 speed automatic i Driving Impressions i My tester Taurus SES Deluxe had the optional 3 0 DOHC Duratec engine almost a 900 option With the 2002 model year coming to a close im sure there are rebates out there on these cars however my tester had none and was priced at a whopping 23 000 without taxes Reliability with the Ford Taurus has almost always been poor I always hear from Taurus owners that their new car has had no problems but after 3 years they are in the shop getting a new transmission These seats offer good support and standard 6 way power adjustments but due to the cheap feel they really put a hamper on certain aspects of my driving experience with this car Wearing a T shirt and the outside temp being 55 degrees yes thats all it gets here during the day my arms felt like they were resting on ice cubes while first trying to get comfy in these pleather seats The transmission while loads refined over the AXOD tranny equipped in the 1986 1995 Tauruses still lacks the precise shifting associated with cars like the Camry or even the Chevy Impala Clunky automatic shifting between 1st gear and 2nd is still noticeable and shifting too soon high gear around 30 MPH is still annoying as the car has virtually no power at this speed in high gear so automatic down shifting and up shifting while driving through town is almost inevitable if you dont not_manually not_take not_it not_out not_of not_overdrive not_Handling not_in not_the not_2002 not_Taurus is good however like most family cars on the twistys this car tends to lean which can be quite prevalent around bends at high speeds At one point in time 1996 I was impressed with this engine but alas other companies have moved ahead with technology and for 2002 this engine just seems like its lagging in the refinement department Off the line acceleration with the Duratec V6 is fair but the DOHC Duratec seems lackadaisical compared to the 3 0 V6 in the 2002 Accord and totally anemic compared to the a href

amazes me that the Ford Taurus is still in production After many years of major transmission engine and general quality control complaints one would have thought this car would have landed itself in an early grave Unlike many other cars that had caused their owners so much anger and grief do to poor reliability quality control and lack of dealer support i e the Hyundai Excel the Ford Taurus somehow made it past all those thousands of unhappy customers and is still being sold for the 2002 year with the claim that it is one of the best selling cars in America For the 2002 model year the Ford Taurus Sedan comes available in a multitude of trim lines that include the base LX the SE SES tester and SEL The instrument cluster is relatively small but offers all the gauges you could want Tachometer temp gauge etc etc are added for driver convenience and are very easy to read while driving Some noteworthy options on the deluxe SES include AC 6 disc in dash CD player adjustable pedals these adjustable pedals may sound cool in theory but I feel Ford should have saved the money and used it on the poor quality leather seating WWW CARS COM has more info on all equipment that can be had with the SES deluxe trim Standard amenities include your basic family bag Dual air bags 4 cup holders remote keyless entry power everything and cruise control All amenities can boast that they are ergonomically friendly however the stereo system is very cluttered much like the systems in the Volvo line up There is a major improvement vs the last generation in this dept Hills are taken well Surprisingly the Duratec V6 enables this heavy weight to tackle up to 7 grades without having to automatically down shift to maintain 75 MPH and can even gain speed up these sorts of inclines if given good right foot power again without the need for the automatic to down shift Braking in the 2002 Taurus SES deluxe is average good Despite this car having the infamous front disc rear drum set up it has standard 4 wheel ABS which help assure good safe stops I was somewhat impressed with braking however I still feel that with the price of the Taurus SES deluxe 4 wheel discs with ABS should be standard equipment Even with the tall gearing fuel economy is only average The 2002 Taurus SES is not not_a not_bad not_handler not_for not_what not_it not_is but like the powertrain most of the

Neg,The four speed overdrive transmission shifts smoothly and responsively for the most part In this model the shifter is mounted to the steering column The intermittent wipers and headlight dimmer switch are located on the turn signal stalk There are two power ports both in front one doubles as a cigarette lighter In only four days exposure I noted the following defects There are sturdy anchor points for two child car seats on the cars rear deck There is a single small rather strangely shaped glove compartment and the ubiquitous door side map pockets The cockpit is laid out comfortably with most controls easily accessible and few if any surprises If all American cars are as poorly made as this particular Taurus the exodus should begin anew Ramblers you name it they drove it some time in the fifties sixties or seventies The Taurus handles moderately well for a mid sized family sedan cornering is responsive with neither crispness nor poor control The drivers seat in this configuration has a seat back tilt adjustment and forward backward adjustment both manual The interior has much of the chunky look adopted by many automakers in the latest 90s and early 2000s The trunk is a capacious 17 cubic feet although the sill is quite high making loading cumbersome for shorter drivers and passengers Not a good idea Ford Not recommended for unimaginative exterior styling some truly stupid interior styling poor quality and average drivability One of Newtons laws of motion states paraphrased that a body in motion tends to remain in motion The lid opens with a key or a dash mounted remote and there is also an emergency latch for opening from the inside Blocks of foam filled naugahyde tend to fight for supremacy with contoured plastic panels in the dash and on the doors The restyling possesses slightly more angularity than the old version with sharper slope breaks at the base of the rear window and on the trunk line The cruise control buttons are on the face of the steering wheel on off on the left and accelerate coast resume on the right Driving Environment The rearseat passengers have two flip out cupholders front seat passengers have two cupholders molded into the underside of the fold up seatbottom One of the most telling forms of inertia is a consumers attachment to a brand or to a model Such devotion asserts itself in an It done me right the last time so I ll stick by it the next time attitude a sort of Tammy Wynette model for consumption The circumference is notched for a cargo net though there was none in the rental vehicle it may be standard and have disappeared The seating arrangements do not not_appear not_to not_have not_changed not_from not_earlier not_models and the instrument panel and dashboard layouts are little changed if at all Driver Car Interface While ive never been tempted to buy a Taurus frankly its larger than I need ive never been unimpressed by the car either This is a vehicle thats always seemed to be a solid dependable if somewhat boring performer but then Id never reviewed one for Epinions either This latter surface also has minimal storage for cassettes and a few coins it dumps its contents when inverted no surprise there to form a seat cushion There are better cars on the road lets buy them instead i Tammy Wynette country Western artist perhaps most widely known for her counter feminist anthem Stand By Your Man i Ford provides a single cubby in the dashboard for front seat passengers Rear seat passengers have pockets on the seatbacks suitable for stowing a magazine and little else Over the years ive driven lots of Tauruses Tauri always as a rental ive driven them through snow in the baking desert sun at the beach and on winding mountain roads This particular model has a convertible front seat which is a bench seat with a center panel that unfolds into a console and or armrest to create the illusion of bucket seats This model was restyled by Ford with the 2000 model year Speaking from memory earlier models were far more dependent upon the oval motif and still retained some of the original versions melted external contours The only locking space in the cabin is the glove compartment Note that when the seat is in bench configuration there are no cup holders and little storage probably moot anyway since the room would be rather limited We often sense inertia

not_maker not_i not_cars So heres my chance after having looked at a 2002 Taurus with a critical eye The Car My ever faithful suppliers at Enterprise rented me a 2002 Taurus SE model a four door with the stock V6 Vulcan engine and a four speed automatic transmission The driver has a good connection to the road when compared to larger vehicles such as the Lincoln Continental but is more isolated than when driving most Japanese sedans Mitsubishi Galant Toyota Camry Braking tends to feel a bit mushy at highway speeds There is no lumbar adjustment Driver seating is relatively comfortable though the lack of lumbar support is somewhat bothersome Rear seat entry in the four door models is a piece of cake and rear seat room is average or above for vehicles of this class The stock 155 hp Vulcan V6 possesses adequate reserve power at highway speeds but is noticeably weak on acceleration from a standing start this is the least powerful of three available V6 engines I averaged about 21 5 MPG with this engine note mostly highway driving That particular combination is apparently quite popular one night in my hotel parking garage I had to choose among the Taurus a Mustang and a Contour all in that color combination I stayed with the Taurus cause I didnt not_have not_keys not_for not_the not_Mustang The ignition key was hard to turn and more than once failed to release from the START position this left the starter motor engaged until I manually released the key At least one body seam had variable width along its length a definite no no one panel is therefore misaligned In fact

available in other trim lines and on competing models Engine noise is somewhat intrusive partially because this particular engine seems to be rather grumbly Road noise is minimal unless the road surface is coarse but wind noise is also rather pronounced Highs and Lows And so I never developed that somewhat slavish brand loyalty and I venture the condition best described by the observation that love is blind But I know that there are a lot of blind consumers out there Americas Most Popular Car Advertisements tell us that the Ford Taurus is Americas most popular car Note however that you

Neutral Zone engine acceleration road handling and braking an average climate control system road noise and wind noise i Negatives the Brake Pedal no fold down rear seat amateurish looking design to interior components especially the console engine noise a disturbing metallic rumble at idle cheesy stock sound system poor quality control see below that stupid front seat console and lack of interior storage On Quality One of the reasons many US buyers deserted American carmakers in the seventies and early eighties was the perception of poor quality in US cars What is true is that the Taurus is one of the most popular cars ever sold in this country and if you lump Mercury Sable in with the Taurus there are as many of them on the road as there are of any other vehicle More importantly the Taurus an ugly melted looking critter at its birth marked Fords re emergence as a power in the mid sized car market after more than a decade of shoddy quality ill advised experimentation and simple ignorance of consumer trends Finally America was making a car that was competitive against Japanese imports so much so that it actually began making inroads into that import market Hooray for American ingenuity and engineering As such the Taurus developed a near cult following giving a new generation a vehicle on which to lavish the familys Ford addiction Suddenly if you ached to drive a stylish dependable car you didnt not_have not_to not_hide not_the not_Toyota not_from not_Dad not_or not_watch not_Uncle not_Stan not_sneer not_at not_the not_Honda not_And not_so

Neg,White This is a major flaw in the design From the outside the 2002 Taurus SE looks pretty good The 2002 Taurus SE on the other hand feels like a dog So basically you get a low energy car with iffy gas mileage The style is a definite improvement over the late 1990s spaceship look The usually adequate V6 Vulcan with 155 horsepower engine is slow to accelerate Is this car sounding good to you yet I hope not not_FINAL not_ASSESSMENT The SE model we have came with a CD player with average speakers and no real bonuses That car has a lot of energy pick up and is easy to drive The passenger seat is similar while the back bench is a bit cramped and not not_particularly not_comfortable for riders The automatic shifting at times has problems between 1st and 2nd gears adding to the already problematic driving experience What I can say is at least the brakes work well on both highways and city roads Once you get up to speed the car functions decently though not not_perfectly Passing is a laborious process The rear seats are fixed and cannot not_be not_folded not_down not_in not_any not_way not_to not_allow not_for not_added not_capacity It really is a disappointing vehicle SPECIFICATIONS 3 Liter V6 Vulcan engine 155 Horsepower 4900 186 Torque 3900 Sequential Multi port Fuel Injection Electronic 4 Speed Automatic Transmission The trunk is rather thick though is lacking when it comes to deepness extending toward the rear seats That larger vehicle gets about 25 miles to the gallon on average The Taurus smallish engine should in reality be more efficient This is a pretty stripped down car THE DRIVING EXPERIENCE I will admit that im jaded because of the 2002 Chevy Impala LS When compared to the earlier style model the 2002 Taurus SE looks nicer from the outside though it took a big step back with the interior The steering wheel mounted cruise control is easy to use and functions pretty well Just a tiny tap of the brakes and the cruise immediately shuts off It in fact is a combination of the more popular earlier and boxier Taurus lines and the style popularized a few years back by creative Japanese auto manufacturers They have a built in audience that will buy a Ford Taurus regardless of higher quality and similarly priced competition like my own lovely 2002 Chevrolet Impala LS THE EXTERIOR If memory serves I do believe that the 1999 Taurus SE at least featured that luxury Other standard features include power windows mirrors and brakes and keyless entry Just dont not_expect not_any not_good not_surprises So far as gas mileage expect to get an average of just over 20 miles per gallon despite Fords claims of higher As compared to my Impala with a much larger engine thats not not_too not_good At well over 20 000 for this car its not not_a not_good not_buy I would recommend buyers look elsewhere to the aforementioned Chevy Impala the Honda Accord the Toyota Camry and even the Chevy Malibu before settling on the Taurus Upon sitting down in the bland medium gray interior the first thing that struck me was that it looks and feels cheaply made Considering the fact that the car retails for over 20 K this isnt not_a not_good not_thing It would be good for small children but by the time kids become teens the seat might be a bit too small With an adequate 17 square foot trunk there is plenty of room in the Taurus But the fact remains that the auto giant made very few if any improvements over the 1999 SE model I in fact have a sneaking suspicion that the company has gotten a bit too comfortable in the market and in the buying public The side panels are relatively blah while the back and front are slightly attractive Ford designers shouldnt not_be not_proud not_of not_their not_work not_on not_the not_car not_redesigned

seats have no features to speak of You can tilt the back and push the seat forward or backward Aside from that the 2002 Taurus SE lacks lumbar support and any of the other perks that are sometimes

husbands white 2002 Ford Taurus SE is bland chintzy and nothing to be proud of The most redeeming quality of the vehicle is that its his company car and we arent forced to shell out our hard earned cash for the not not_quite not_mediocre piece of crap With that said I have nothing against Ford or the Taurus for that matter
Neg,The interior is roomy however The sun visors are cheaply done as well It also has a theft remote lock and entry system They feel like painted cardboard and are just about as thick No luxuries like illuminated mirrors or extension for side facing sun The major problem here is that there is no cover to the storage area The CD player and stereo seem to work well although CD and a cassette combination are not not_available So far nothing has changed I still have that love hate relationship with the Taurus If you opt for the six passenger seating you will even find the middle seat up front to have good leg room This is particularly helpful for someone under about 5 7 Even with this comfort your ride will be uncomfortable because the seats are cheaply done They have little contour or padding to them For someone who spends a lot of time in a car I would think twice here Anything you keep here including coins in the coin holder is in plain sight until you again fold everything up leaving you with no cup holders again Having driven Ford Taurus frequently from rental companies over the years I have come to a love hate relationship Now I have one of my own and nothing has changed You get used to how far a wheel should turn on most cars this doesnt even come close Inside they have made attempts at comfort though they miss the mark This Taurus was not not_my not_choice not_it not_is not_a not_company not_car not_which not_I not_use not_100 not_of not_the not_time not_for not_both not_business not_and not_personal not_use not_Ford not_is not_slowly not_improving not_the not_style not_particularly not_phasing not_out not_the not_oval not_shape not_of not_just not_about not_everything The power drivers seat option is great and adjusts well Having that also allows you to get the optional adjustable pedals I love it You will never not_again have leg cramps on long trips or find yourself adjusting your legs because the pedals are too far away or to close One poor design is the armrest center console on the six passenger seating Folded up for the sixth passenger everything is fine except that there are no cup holders available to you You can then unfold and open the armrest to expose the cupholders and the console storage area while a second piece becomes the armrest The elimination of the oval shaped back window and the hardening of some of the exterior flow lines towards the rear of the car have helped its looks greatly This Taurus has a fairly smooth ride and a good grip on the road Steering control is fairly tight Steering range is another story I have never before had to back up and try again to navigate tight spots as much as I have to with this car
Neg,That thing couldnt pull the skin off a rice pudding This might have been acceptable in 1975 but things have moved on a long way since then This is the sort of softly suspended barge on wheels American cars used to be like It is impossible to gradually release a foot system so making fully controllable getaways a distant dream Handling Handling Nope not not_on not_this not_thing Anybody living in a hilly area is going to become rapidly hacked off with not not_having not_a not_normal not_handbrake not_rather not_than not_the not_stupid not_foot not_operated not_system Now that is a car they should be offering to the American public rather than the shoddy heap of garbage that is the Taurus My last 3 cars were 2 SAABs and an Audi A4 so perhaps criticising the handling is a little unfair Problem is that Fords offering in this category in Europe is the Mondeo and it kicks bottom It is flatter than roadkill and only slightly more attractive I dont not_know not_its not_top not_speed not_as not_I not_never not_felt not_sufficiently not_in not_control not_to not_test not_it not_It not_felt not_like not_it not_would not_have not_trouble not_outrunning not_a not_moped not_but not_I not_never not_had not_the not_courage not_to not_try not_it not_Brakes not_are not_adequate not_without not_being not_startling not_I not_did not_find not_that not_parking not_brake not_to not_be not_hopeless I was given this car as a company vehicle when I first arrived in the US 2 months ago My first thought on seeing it was what an ugly heap I was more impressed by the luggage space as it fairly easily swallowed all of the stuff a family of 4 carry when travelling to a new land Driving from the airport to the hotel I was immediately struck by how soft the seats were Almost sofa like in comfort if you only travel for a few miles Problem is that for longer journeys they are completely lacking in support and I was in agony after only 50 miles or so Next nuisance item was the multifunction stalk for controlling lights wipers etc Really these functions should be seperated but the use of a column gear change prevents that These column mounted gear stalks are very quaint but personally if I never see one again it will be too soon Performance was well how could I put this without cussing absolutely useless
Neg,It was cheap material The console cup holders arent big enough The hole dash board layout is totaly illogical Then all sudden the ovals came out and a smaller taurus That i kept buying because each year they kept getting better and better On the passanger side their is abosultey no place for you to lay you feet down flat When you sit down your feet are always propt up on something And of course i could go on with the list Why am i bringing this up because this is all important do to the fact how ford taurus has progressed into a awesome car And i do beleive when they came up with the ideas for this new series of ford taurus that they must have been smoken something for sure The sterring on the car seems like it has a huge understeer to it It almost seems like you have to turn the wheel around 5 times just to get it to do a square corner They moved the unlock and lock on the up part of the door and not not_down where the fingers would normally be who in the world came up with that idea they must have been smokin somethin Most foreign cars if not not_all come standard deafualt with a cd player built into the dash cassete then becomes optional and thats how it should be Air climate control totally sucks should be digital and temperature driven by degress The spedometer totally sucks also you cant not_tell not_what not_the not_heck not_speed not_your not_doing not_theirs not_more not_lines not_and not_dashes then their are actuall speed listings so you have to study the damn dash to figure out what speed you are doing It came with a cassete deck has default and no cd player im sorry but cassete deck built into the dash Cassete deck shouldnt not_even not_exist not_anymore not_in not_the not_car not_I not_praticlly not_laughed not_my not_head not_off not_when not_i not_saw not_this not_ford not_most not_still not_be not_living not_in not_the not_1980s Well lets get right to the point I was a big owner of Taurus I have own practicly all models except this one Taurus has always been on the cutting edge for technology and power over most manufactures cars that are comparable to the taurus It breaks me heart to say this but i will probably not not_by not_another not_taurus until i see improvement I will be heading over to the toyota series of cars now Because it seems like the foreigns have more innovation and techonolgy in their cars now Ford is still living in the 1980s Then next was the smaller engine when i ask the manufacture if they have more engine packages he said no 3 0 is it Come on So i forgave them and look into the interior i wasnt not_impress not_it not_wasnt not_up not_to not_par not_with not_the not_typical not_norm not_of not_ford not_taurus not_in not_the not_pass The only good thing it has going for itself is the fact that it has a smooth ride and thats it o and the trunk size is decent thats it O just though of another bad the sound system in the car is terriable its really tinney sounding and the radio stations sound really far away when their not not_Ford has ruined the Taurus and this model i will not not_buy One of the main reasons why Taurus made it into the nascar races because Taurus was building a name for themselves of making powerfull cars in 1995 Taurus came out with their ultimate car which was the 3 8liter v6 SHO taurus folks let me tell you if you ever get a chance to ride in a 3 8 liter v6 SHO taurus do so because the minute that person lays his foot on the pedal your jaw will be in the back seat
Neg,You d never see me buy one of those but I drove enough in a rental car to make myself a good opinion Quite silent at highway speed except for tire noise Handling is not not_too not_bad and healthy body roll is contained brakes are strong enough in spite of the absence of rear discs Seats have absolutely no lateral support which makes driving on twisty roads a real pain Auto gearbox 4th gear is way too long engine lacks torque to hold it unless road is flat Steering mounted gear lever is clumsy although it saves space for stuff between the seats Upshifts are okay although not not_without not_hesitations not_at not_low not_speeds but downshifts are slow Build quality is really average to low I had the steering lock mechanism coming out inadvertently Plastics quality and assy leaves to be desired we are far far away from Audi league

Neg,The body is extremely durable The interior is really easy to maintain Our car is Wedge wood Blue with light gray interior We had one incident were they would not not_work not_at not_all not_very not_scary But the latest deaths and Tire recall as well as the big fears of the SUV rollovers The one SUV that seems to be involved in most of the rollovers is the Ford Explorer We have had a very minor 3mph fender bender and it done no damage to our rear bumper but pealed off the paint and dented the other cars front bumper We purchased the 2000 Ford Explorer 4WD XLT Sport Utility Vehicle SUV back in August of 99 We previously owned a Mustang GT and a Camaro z28 Yeah Huge change For some unknown reason while driving down the road the windshield wiper would suddenly turn on by itself and swipe the window about 3 times and then stop The only happened a few times and we called the dealer about it but said that they couldnt duplicate the problem unless it happened while they were looking at it Well needless to say we never took it in because it stopped We have two toddlers and you could imagine our fears with having the light interior but I am proud to say that there has not not_been not_one not_spot not_that not_we not_couldnt not_get not_out not_After not_about not_3 not_months not_of not_owning not_this not_SUV not_we not_started not_having not_a not_weird not_problem not_with not_the not_windshield not_wipers These recent facts have brought my husband and I to the decision of trading in our Explorer for 4 door car If anyone asks me in the future what I think of the Ford Explorer I would say exactly what I have here I would most definitely NOT recommend it to anyone The reason we chose this SUV is because we were able to get the dealer to come off the price and we needed an SUV or Family Car before the birth of my second child Since our purchase we are extremely disappointed and unhappy with our Explorer Dont get me wrong we enjoy the spacious seating and all the options But the all around product is very low quality for the big bucks you pay Engine options for our model included 4 0 liter 160 hp V6 Which feels like very little power when starting out For highway driving it handles okay but has a lot of wobble feeling on the inside and you hear a lot of road noise But it still bothers us Our latest problem with this really loud high pitched whining sound that comes from the under side but only happen while driving under 20 MPH and when its cold Well we took it into the shop yesterday to be exact and the darn thing wasnt not_doing not_it so they did nothing for us But What do you know it started doing it again that same night GRRRRR I know that all cars are not not_100 not_perfect and that these problems are minor We of course took them in to get fixed along with another strange mechanical defect the check engine soon light would always stay on They fixed the windshield wiper motor and said that a sensor went out causing the engine light to stay on so they fixed that Shortly after this day we received a recall on the wipers During the next summer of owning this SUV we had a few incidents were the SUV wouldnt not_go not_in not_reverse not_with not_out not_putting not_it not_in not_drive not_first not_Not not_good not_when not_in not_tight not_places not_0P
Neg,On some models keyless entry systems are in use Entering this vehicle without a key is easy This consists of a number pad on the driver door The owner simply punches a combination to enter the vehicle As for those who already own one I would consider disabling the keyless entry system A thief could find one of these vehicles in a dark parking lot and just sit next to it and punch random numbers untill the door opens Whats so bad about that you say Well the problem is this If the correct combination is entered by itself or within ANY STRING OF NUMBERS the door unlocks This cuts the time it takes to punch the correct random number considerably I would strongly caution anyone buying this vehicle to inquire with the car dealer as to whether or not not_this not_problem has been fixed on new models There is no time delay and no maximum number of tries I tried this myself and was able to enter the vehicle after about 3 minutes of random number punching Also a permanant backup code is in the system in case you forget your personal code
Neg,So perhaps my bias is showing The quality of the sound was good The car seemed stiff to me in handling I rented a Ford Explorer 2000 for 3 days and was unimpressed The steering is tight and any small movement will cause the car to pull appreciably There were four different buttons for seat positioning but two seemed to have the same function The first thing I noticed in the rental parking lot was the Firestone tires on the vehicle There are many settings and features on the radio and this one came with a very good quality cd player The interior was great for cargo space but there seemed to be even less leg room for the back seat area This was an 8 cylinder and had less than 1 K miles on it The gas mileage must have been around 14 15 So it is easy to see how one could turn one of these over with a sudden yank on the steering wheel The locking mechanism was on a fob key holder and it worked well Although I thought that they could have increased the sound to better hear the locking mechanisms for safety sake The interior was nicely designed but the leg room was inadequate I am only 5 5 and found that I could not not_put not_the not_seat not_back not_far not_enough not_for not_my not_comfort not_Also not_I not_found not_that not_after not_a not_while not_the not_seat not_felt not_uncomfortable The power was okay this one was an 8 cylinder not not_impressive and not not_a not_real not_powerhouse despite the mileage or lack thereof I doubt that I would ever own one of these Explorers I currently own a Jeep Grand Cherokee and have been a Jeep owner for over ten years This vehicle was hard to get in and out of because of the wheel height Even using the running board it was not not_easy not_to not_get not_into not_I not_had not_to not_pull not_myself not_up not_into not_it not_The not_visibility not_is not_good not_since not_you not_are not_sitting not_higher not_than not_most not_other not_vehicles not_on not_the not_road

Neg,This car CANNOT take bumps The Explorer has a 17 gallon tank At first glance I liked the Explorer In average city highway use you get about 14 mpg if you re lucky The front windshield would indicate otherwise Its about the same size as the windshield on my Chevrolet Prizm The paint was nice console was nice leather on the seats was nice room looked nice I recently had the opportunity to drive a NEW less than 1 month old Ford Explorer XLT I approached this car with an open mind When I stepped into the drivers seat for the first time my good impression of the car began to fade It is astounding to me that a new Explorer shakes so very much when going over the smallest of bumps The bottom of the seat was comfortable however which while a plus didnt not_make not_up not_for not_the not_headrests I approached the Explorer thinking of it as an SUV This is the same size as my boyfriends Toyota Supra which for those of you who dont not_know is a smallish sports car A 17 gallon tank wouldnt not_be not_so not_bad not_except not_when not_you not_factor not_in not_the not_mpg Id heard good things from my mother the owner of the car in question as well as bad things from those who didnt not_own not_one not_A not_spring not_break not_where not_I not_was not_to not_be not_the not_sole not_driver not_of not_this not_car not_should not_have not_been not_the not_perfect not_chance not_to not_bond not_with not_the not_new not_car not_Right not_Wrong The size of the windshield isnt not_a not_great not_problem not_but not_a not_fairly not_large not_annoyance not_Because not_of not_the not_position not_of not_the not_console not_in not_reference not_to not_the not_roof not_the not_rearview not_mirror not_is not_literally not_in not_the not_middle not_of not_the not_windshield not_which not_makes not_viewing not_small not_items not_such not_as not_street not_signs not_difficult not_when not_in not_the not_correct not_position not_ive not_got not_to not_belive not_there not_is not_some not_design not_that not_could not_solve not_this not_problem Due to the make of the seats in order to have the back at a correct position for driving the headrest just a continuation of the seat was so far back that I seriously had concerns about major whiplash in the event of a minor fender bender Despite trying different positions of the seat back at no point could I get the headrest at a position in which to stop my neck from being whipped back in the littlest of accidents This is less than both the Suburban and Tahoe For a car of this size to have such a small gas tank when the designers are aware of its low gas mileage its completely insane I tried to like the Explorer but in the end I just couldnt I belive my first words to my mother were Didnt you research this car before you bought it I will be sticking to my original decision to buy a Chevrolet Tahoe the Ford Explorer XLT just isnt not_worth not_it These are bumps that do NOT rattle any other SUVs including the Suburban and Tahoe When a 95 Suburban takes the same bumps better than a brand new Explorer I just cringe when thinking about how it will be in 5 years Going down a fairly bumpy road Expect to have a horrible headache from your brain being rattled around in your skull even at speeds as low as 10mph I really do love going to the gas station daily Really I do especially when the snow is blowing horizontally in my face SUVs while known as gas guzzlers do have standards
Neg,And might I add not not_without not_signifigant not_problems When it was running I really enjoyed my Explorer It just didnt not_measure not_up not_to not_the not_expectations not_given not_to not_me not_by not_the not_SUV not_craze im musch happier with my Honda Accord While the good outnumbers the bad it doesnt really outweigh the bad Friends with Jimmys or Blazers never had the ammount of problems I did I wouldnt not_reccoment not_an not_Explorer not_to not_a not_friend not_or not_even not_a not_despised not_enemy The gas milage wasnt not_terrible not_for not_such not_a not_big not_SUV not_but not_still not_not not_too not_economical not_which was only compounded with my other truck related expenses I felt safe driving it not not_too not_topheavy but quite sturdy due to its broad wheelbase and had lots of fun piling up dozens of friends at a time for roadtrips Within those 30 months I replaced the transmission 2000 two air conditioner compressors 500 and it needed a third toward the end the radiator 100 patch that didnt not_work and the replacement was a Chirstmas present along with numerous minor repairs that only added to my frustration electrical problems faulty starters leaky oil gauges that ruined some pants etc Momma said that if you cant not_say not_anything not_nice not_dont not_say not_anything not_at not_all not_Sorry not_Ford but I cant not_follow not_that not_adage not_when not_talking not_about not_my not_Explorer not_God rest his soul I bought my 1990 Explorer XLT 2wd used right after I graduated high school in 1997 With about 120k miles I ran it up to 175 k albeit a high number but not not_outside not_normal not_boundaries within 2 and a half years
Neg,I must say that when I leased my new Ford Explorer Sport 4WD it was to replace my 1998 Ford Explorer Sport I loved the 1998 model It was dependable reliable and got me where I needed to be even in the worst weather Even on the beach it was super The dealership fixed these things without problems but then came the Firestone tire recall I must say I would not not_recommend not_the not_Ford not_Explorer not_to not_anyone not_after not_this not_tire not_recall When my lease expired and it was time for me to choose another vehicle I went to the same dealer and traded the 1998 for the 2000 model At first I loved it Then came very minor things that went wrong that I didnt not_think not_should not_have not_been not_wrong not_with not_a not_BRAND not_NEW not_SUV It truly is not not_fair not_to not_be not_so not_down not_on not_Ford and I realize that the tires were not not_known not_to not_be not_defective not_when not_they not_were not_installed not_on not_my not_vehicle not_however not_it not_was not_the not_WAY not_THE not_RECALL not_WAS not_HANDLED or should I say mishandled that turned me off to my SUV I was told my car was safe to drive dependable and reliable I was also told that even though my tires on this vehicle were defective there was no need to worry and that I didnt not_need not_to not_replace not_them If it made me feel better they recommended I find the nearest Firestone tire dealer go there and have them replaced but that it was NOT NECESSARY to do so It was this mishandling of the incident that makes me hate this particular vehicle and I wouldnt not_recommend not_this not_vehicle not_to not_anyone not_Furthermore not_I not_took not_the not_SUV not_back not_to not_the not_dealership not_told not_them not_I not_didnt not_have not_time not_to not_be not_calling not_running not_around not_looking not_for not_Firestone not_tire not_dealers and that since this vehicle was under lease and I didnt not_own not_it and since I have been a loyal customer to this dealership for many years I felt strongly it was their problem and they should replace the tires I was told next that I should contact Ford Motor Company in Michigan and take it up with them because the dealership had no intention of replacing these tires
Neg,The car has not not_evolved not_seriously not_in not_the not_last not_five not_years The Explorer drives more like a nightmare than a dream The wheel jerks slowly there is not not_desired not_glide not_effect not_here The looks used to be daring no they are overdone What has it done to deserve this achievement The Ford Explorer was once new in hip but has quickly become painstakingly dull When test driving a new Ford Explorer it is easy to ask yourself Why How is this the most popular SUV in recent years The Explorers interior as well is uninteresting the best new feature theyve come up with is the CD dial on the steering wheel Other than that the interior has somewhat of a cheap feel As the next millenium approaches it is time for Ford to think of something new The Explorer will not not_cut not_it not_much not_longer not_Maybe not_a not_2001 not_edition not_of not_the not_Bronco not_will not_bring not_trusty not_SUV not_lovers not_back not_into not_Fords not_open not_arms

Neg,We leased this vehicle for 2 years Then of course there were all the mechanical problems It had guts great passing power but you sure needed to feed it lots From the electric seats breaking malfunctioning all the time making access to the back seat even harder to the 4 wheel drive kicking on and off without notice If the heating or cooling system was on while idling at a stop light you would hear this strange clicking noise which always made me nervous The 2 doors feature was kind of lame too I would have changed that out of everything that I found wrong with it Simply because getting a child in and out of a car seat is a real pain when you only have 2 doors We began our lease in late 1997 just before our first son was born thinking that it would be a great vehicle for kids groceries travel and all that First off it was an absolute pig on gas Put your foot on the pedal and watch the gas gauge go down down down This truck kind of reminds me of Windows 95 when it first came out it needed the bugs worked out before putting it on the market And 4x4 it is not not_I not_took not_my not_Explorer not_Sport not_onto not_a not_gravel not_road not_and not_down not_a not_somewhat not_steep not_and not_bumpy not_slope and I couldnt get back out without a lot of effort My 1985 Toyota Land Cruiser makes the 97 Explorer look like a sorry excuse of a 4x4 thats for sure And I could pretty much guarantee a flat tire each and every time I took it down a gravel road 5 flat tires in less that 2 years I hear the tires on my truck have recently been recalled so perhaps that had something to do with it The the paint began to peel off the front hood the power windows would work some days and then not not_work not_the not_next not_3 not_burnt not_out not_headlights not_umm not_should not_I not_go not_on not_Who not_should not_buy not_this not_vehicle not_A not_Ford not_Mechanic not_I not_dont not_recommend not_it not_Sure not_it not_looks not_good not_and not_is not_fun not_to not_drive not_but not_who not_needs not_the not_headaches
Neg,We should have chosen the expedition At the time though we had only one child and room was not not_a not_factor It will turn over but it sounds like its out of gas It will not not_start not_on not_occasion not_and not_fortunately not_hasnt not_left not_me not_completely not_stranded It will seat 5 but adults struggle to sit comfortably in the back We have recently had some problems with it too but it may be just OUR vehicle If you have children I wouldnt not_recommend not_this not_vehicle not_if not_you not_want not_any not_room not_at not_all not_However not_for not_a not_single not_person not_or not_two not_person not_family not_it not_would not_be not_fine I can remember when the explorers first came on the market and I vowed I would someday own one I loved the looks of them We took it in to get it checked but they cant not_figure not_it not_out not_One not_minute not_it not_wont not_start and 5 minutes later it will drives me crazy We have had our Explorer for almost 2 years and it wasnt not_the not_best not_choice not_of not_vehicles not_for not_us not_We not_went not_from not_a not_Pontiac not_Minivan not_so not_the not_lack not_of not_room not_was not_definitely not_noticed The kids never have enough room for their stuff and constantly fight over it As far as driving an explorer we needed a 4x4 because of our muddy roads and snow and its rough riding If you are wanting a leisurely drive I dont not_recommend not_the not_this not_vehicle However no matter what vehicle I choose I will be faced with this because I need a bigger vehicle that sits me up higher and has 4 x 4 Overall I dont not_hate not_my not_explorer but now that ive had one ive satisfied my curiosity and will not not_own not_another not_for not_a not_main not_vehicle In the are of comfort for me its just not not_very appealing there either I need room for my purse and anything else I need for work and if im the only one its okay but get another adult in and theres just no room for us either I have to drive 18 miles one way to work every day so gas mileage is another factor I only get around 17mpg
Neg,It is a service nightmare But some things are just downright ridiculous On the plus side the front seats are relatively comfortable The ability to be a cargo hauler was required The initial test drive as well as the first 3 months were wonderful The dealer serviced this car every 3000 miles by the book The minor stuff first a major annoyance was the tight access to the rear seat On top of all that the body was starting to rust in four different places Also the power and torque that the engine develops is very impressive I can not not_recommend not_this not_car The vehicle met all of my requirements not not_to not_mention not_that not_I not_felt not_it not_was not_a not_great not_looking not_vehicle The interior remained fairly squeek free though in year three the car developed a rattle coming from just behind the drivers side door The problems started around month three lasted for four years and ended just two weeks ago when I sold that car If for some reason you feel the need to take the plunge into this Ford nightmare spend as much as you can on an extended warranty you will need it I bought this car new in 1997 to replace my Nissan 240SX I was looking for a vehicle that was both sporty yet very roomy and capable enough to handle the winters snow and ice In the four years I owned that car I had the throttle body replaced six times intake manifold gaskets replaced various recalls too numerous to list and had multiple transmission and 4x4 problems No matter what preventative measures I took this car would break down After 4 years I just learned to accept it So 3 weeks after I made the last payment I sold that car At first I thought I could live with it but it soon became very annoying That is really nothing to fault the explorer for because 2 door vs 4 door is really a personal opinion Just before selling the car my explorer started to make a loud clunking noise as the transmission dropped out of gear every time I stopped at a stop sign Equally amusing was the way it refused to go in reverse unless I first shifted into Park and waited 3 or more seconds
Neg,At LEAST before little problems began appearing It seems he has had so much little troubles here and there and he shouldnt not_really not_have not_any not_at not_all not_with not_as not_new not_as not_it not_is this vehicle is as good a car as any but not not_the not_greatest I have borrowed my fathers 97 ford explorer many times for long trips or lengthy city drives and for these purposes it is fine That was not not_the not_case not_though not_I not_would not_recommend not_if not_you not_are not_considering not_this not_vehicle not_you not_may not_want not_to not_consider not_a not_few not_others not_as not_well not_get not_any not_available not_review not_reports not_and not_test not_that not_have not_been not_done not_to not_this not_vehicle It is roomy and comfortable inside it offers a seperate set of controls for climate and music aside from the front seats set he chose leather seats which i personally do not not_care not_for not_so not_much not_but not_it not_also not_has not_a not_range not_of not_adjustment not_buttons not_for not_the not_front not_seats not_which not_can not_be not_nice There is a temperature gage and direction indicator near the rearview mirror His has a 6 CD holder and a tape player and a large area in the back for storage and such I think this vehicle though was built from the inside out They either were too concerned about minor inner details or put them all there to cover up the real problems When the air conditioning runs in the summer when you are sitting at a light you can hear it running poorly with a repeated tick in it i have personally never been able to figure out how to convince the cruise control to operate A mysterious breakage of a handle near the driver seat occurred and blame was placed but never accepted It seems to me that they forgot to screw all the bolts in this vehicle tightly enough and while you are dazed and fascinated by all the pretty gadgets on the inside there is chaos going on outside it seems to me that he also had problems with the driver window or maybe it was the MPH gage when they went to fix it they gave it back and it suddenly randomly began chanting that his door was ajar I think for the reputation of ford and the price and year of this ford Explorer he should have had another 3 5 years
Neg,The service of my Explorer at the local dealer Merced CA has been extremely poor The manifold problem has been addressed three times with the service department and the problem still exists to some degree The mirror creates more front blindspot than I have ever seen in a vehicle Definitely a safety oversight on Fords part While the Ford Explorer may for some be a terrific vehicle two years with mine has me wanting more for my money First thing I noticed about it was how the rear view mirror reduces the visibility when trying to see objects in front and slightly to the right In addition the power windows have failed twice in the first year the front tires have worn irregularly due to parts not not_originally installed for front end adjustments that need to be added and an exhaust manifold that leaks which creates a tapping sound They have on three occasions not not_completed not_the not_work not_as not_promised not_and not_left not_me not_without not_a not_vehicle not_offering not_no not_loaner not_Add not_to not_this not_terrible not_gas not_mileage and im looking to unload mine Sad thing is the retail value is a lot lower than your dealer will tell you
Neg,When I drove the Explorer home I was very impressed It was so noisy I couldnt hear myself think If your looking to by a used Ford Explorer make sure you look into the maintenance history The truck itself is a good truck but Ford had alot of problems with the 1997s It had the power I wanted and it drove like a car Well this feeling was very short After a couple of months I felt like I was sitting in the engine compartment They told my option was a new 4 6 OHC engine that had 200 HP compared to the V 8 that had 215 HP After all was said and done I leased the vehicle for 2 years After a week of tests and a recall notice they told me I needed a new cam and the upper portion of the engine the truck only had 4000 miles on it When I took the truck home it was still noisy in the interior but it drove well The next year and a half had its ups and downs I returned to the dealership 41 more times to fix a bunch of problems Some of the problems were the Ls R door was getting stuck it started to burn more fuel then it should have and it had a whole bunch of recalls I was looking for the best sport utility on the market and Ford said they had the best so I went to go look at it I was pretty impressed for what I saw When I sat down with the salesperson I couldnt believe all the options the Explorer had I told the salesperson I wanted power in the engine but didnt not_want not_AWD On one cold day in November I went outside to start the truck and heard banging coming from under the hood I couldnt imagine what it was I drove over to the dealership to see what it was and the service manager looked at it with two mechanics and still couldnt figure it out They told me to leave the truck there so they could run some tests
Neg,It is time for something fun Regarding my soon to be EX Explorer I can say very little positive about this vehicle Now that my daughter is away to college I am finally allowing myself to purchase my mid life vehicle probably a miata There are many other SUVs out there that I am sure are better but I am tired of them The carpet in the back pulled up from the edges even though the biggest thing I would put back there were grocries or luggage In driving this vehicle I found that cornering was somewhat clumsy and I was continualy feeling like I would tip over Gas milage was what you would expect from a suv it ran close to 15mpg Always it seems not not_under not_the not_warranty not_I not_dont not_know not_if not_this not_was not_the not_dealers not_fault not_or not_the not_vehicle but even though there were very few miles put on all repairs seemed to fall under the wear and tear clause of the warranty This Explorer has been a nightmare from day one Besides being somewhat over priced the repairs on this vehicle alone could have paid for the note for a year With in my first year I had to have the front suspension re worked and the brakes adjusted 3 times
Neg,They will no longer have my business I had not not_lost not_a not_clutch not_in not_a not_vehicle not_since not_my not_Volkswagon not_days not_back not_in not_the not_70s To continue this saga eight months and 25 000 miles later a second clutch has been reported burned out from normal use I bought my Ford Explorer XLT w 5 speed transmission new in 1997 I was primarily interested in the vehicle for its roominess and its 4 wheel capabilities during the winter months In addition I am terribly disturbed by the cost of servicing the vehicle at dealerships labor costs have recently jumped to 70 hr which is absurd It now costs 500 1000 every time I take the vehicle in to be serviced suffice it to say my next vehicle will NOT be a Ford Explorer Although I enjoyed the ride for the first few months I quickly became disappointed with the gas mileage and at 45 000 miles I lost the clutch 900 and I only do highway driving round trip commute Worcester Boston at 6 00a and 2 00p My driving habits have not not_changed not_from not_the not_above not_And not_now not_the not_Ford not_dealership not_wants not_another not_625 not_to not_replace not_this not_second not_clutch not_Ford not_will not_not not_stand not_behind not_its not_product not_so not_i not_am not_dumping not_this not_lemon not_into not_the not_laps not_of not_the not_dealership not_I not_have not_been not_driving not_standard not_transmission not_vehicles not_for not_30 not_years not_and not_never not_have not_I not_had not_to not_replace not_a not_clutch not_in not_any not_vehicle not_with not_less not_than not_100 not_000 not_miles not_in not_it not_Ford not_is not_the not_worst not_vehicle not_experience not_of not_my not_life
Neg,The transmission failing once was not not_a not_problem Then about a week later we realized another problem The transmission failed However after this we were o k We got it fixed and nobody got hurt We now own a Toyota 4 Runner and it performs great You can only fit the little munchkins from The Wizard of Oz in the back seat The true problem was 1 month after the transmission failed 300 miles since the 1st transmission failure The cargo space however was very good and if needed the Explorer can be used as a truck The Explorer cost us roughly 23 000 and came with a leather interior and was almost totally loaded except for a sun or moon roof All of these things are very trivial compared to the typical problem with Fords that we encountered about 8 months ago It seems as if Ford is still in its constant struggle to produce a quality automobile My Family and I purchased a 1997 Ford Explorer used from a dealership When we bought the Explorer she had already lived about 33 000 miles of her nasty painful life After about a month with no problems the brakes started to give us trouble If you do however choose to buy an Explorer get a long term extended warranty because you will need it If anyone would like more info on these 2 cars then you can e mail me at Odoyell hotmail com It is an excellent car and anyone who likes can read an epinion i wrote on that If you can pay the little extra bit of money for the 4 Runner then you will most likely save money in the long run The transmission failed again Many of my friends drive Explorers and among the 6 or 7 that do I have only seen 1 other case of transmission problems and only 2 more cases of problems in general with the car However you can say why I must vent my dislike for the Explorer
Neg,Ford sent him a letter and told him they were aware of the problems but as if yet there as never been a recall or an offer to exchange the engine before it leaves you stranded on some lonely road I still have this SUV but refuse to drive it on trips because of the questionable reliability I have owned a ford explorer sport for about two years I love the ride and the extras but the engine leaves something to be desired I had this vehicle for about three months and the engine siezed up and had to be completely replaced what a disaster A friend of mine had the same excate SUV and the SAME THING HAPPENED TO HIM
Neg,It drove terribly Let me tell you this car was from from good shape That testdrive indicated to me fords quality and their desire not not_to not_have not_you not_pleased not_with not_your not_car not_but not_to not_make not_a not_sale not_no not_matter not_what I recently was in the market for a used SUV I went to the Ford dealer to see what was in their used car stock The salesman told me they had just received a 97 explorer on a trade and he thought the car was in excellent shape I took his word for it and took the car out for a test drive The steering was loose and out of control the engine sounded like it was going to explode and the acceleration and power were nowhere near what i expected them to be I told the slaesman what i thought and walked out of the dealership
Neg,It is a good kid car One a manual transmission for my daughter The driving has been smooth and comfortable The other an automatic for myself I purchased two new Ford Escorts in 1996 They are still running well without major problems They both are 2 door hatchbacks with alloy wheels One or more speaker had to be replaced in my daughters vehicle My left front speaker fizzled last spring and needs to be replaced The price looks Sunrise Red handling safety and comfort were perfect for us My daughter has had an overheat light that comes on and had to be repaired twice The Escorts operating cost has been minimal I have not not_had not_any not_problem not_with not_the not_engine not_of not_my not_automatic This was not not_too not_suprising not_since not_she not_was not_in not_her not_early not_20s not_when not_we not_first not_got not_the not_cars There was damaged plastic molding on the side of my car which needed to be replaced immediately The light was a false alarm and the car never overheated Both of us have had problems with the vehicle speakers My daughter had a speaker and radio on order which still hasnt come so she bought her own and replaced them My daughter has played taxi to the city of Minneapolis so her car has more than twice the mileage on it than mine does It took a couple of months to get the piece so it could be replaced Both cars have had speakers on order since last spring The Escort takes a lot and keeps on driving A good solid car for a little economy which will pile up a lot of miles without repair This is the biggest problem we have had with the cars Parts covered under warranty are taken off taken out and put on order and we still dont not_have not_them
Neg,We will not not_be not_buying not_a not_Ford not_again The AC went out on us in early 2001 We definitely wanted to stretch after a few hours The speedometer broke with around 25 000 miles but was still under warranty The paint on the rear bumper is faded Gas mileage was fairly good we got around 30 mpg on the highway unless the AC was running and then that sucked it down much faster The cost to repair it was outrageous but fortunately a mechanic asked if it was a dirty plug connection or something which it was so the problem was fixed for around 60 The interior is fairly comfortable In July 2002 the same month we paid the car off it stopped in the middle of traffic while my husband was coming to the airport to get us At 86 000 miles regularly maintained the car needs a new motor I bought my 1996 Ford Escort in January 1997 with 9 000 miles on it I drove it with only minor problems until this last year Over the course of the last 6 years we regularly maintained it changing the oil every 3 000 miles If you have children know that the AC does NOT reach the back even though its a smaller car Our baby was always bright red even with it going full blast And while the AC is on you will not not_be not_going not_over not_any not_mountains The cost to purchase a used motor will run around 3 000 A new motor will cost 5 000 After speaking with several mechanics Ford dealers etc everyone has told us that the cost to repair the car is more than it is worth We turned off the AC then because the car felt like it was straining We replaced the windshield twice 150 each new tires twice which are NOT a standard size and so are much more expensive between 55 and 75 each and a new front and rear engine mount 200 Now as to why I am writing this review Yes it is We are now without transportation with a toddler and one on the way We did not not_expect not_to not_be not_in not_this not_situation not_for not_years not_based not_on not_the not_reputation not_of not_Ford But we are No trade in value no chance to sell it no car Everyone says thats so unusual they dont not_normally not_do not_that not_Well not_mine not_did not_I not_would not_recommend not_staying not_away not_from not_Ford not_Escorts not_Replacing not_a not_motor not_at not_86 not_000 not_miles is ridiculous The cloth seats held up well Rear speakers stopped working after the second year Instrumentation is easy to read however the check engine and check coolant lights came on at random times and after numerous diagnostic tests at around 70 dollars a pop we learned that they just like to do that Leg room is sufficient although we are fairly short people both under 5 10 My husband always had to drive with a travel pillow behind his lower back on long trips but I was fine
Neg,Not a fun car to own buy only if desperate We bought this car for price and fuel economy as a 2nd car But all it is is a small hatchback nothing more Go for a sedan you probably shouldnt not_buy not_this not_under not_any not_conditions Its lack of power locks and windows is infuriating Id more than trade the power seat belt for those Whats more ironic is that this is the GL model which by all rights should be better You feel every pothole like you are being dragged over it face first and it rides as high as a skateboard Its only plus is that it never needs repairs but we never use it much it has 25 k on it thats all Much more and im certain there would be more problems It is a reliable car that gets good gas mileage Unfortunately it is microscopic the ride is unpleasant it rattles like crazy uncomfortable seats no features and if it came into contact with anything larger than a basketball it would be smashed to bits The front seats are bearable but the back seat is quite possibly the most unpleasant place on earth Its acceleration is weak from its pitiful 1 3L four but it can nip in between cars and gets you where you need to go though I wouldnt not_take not_it not_on not_the not_highway not_at not_gunpoint not_I not_could not_almost not_call not_it not_sporty not_if not_its not_top not_speed not_was not_higher not_than not_85 not_mph
Neg,At night this unseemly intimacy is generally accompanied by the use of high beams as well I am working on a device that will refocus incoming light back onto the offending vehicles radiator and boil it dry I am not not_intimately not_familiar not_with not_the not_Ford not_350 not_Series not_beyond not_reading not_the not_corporate not_blurb not_graciously not_provided not_by not_Ford not_However not_having not_observed not_up not_close not_and not_personal not_some not_of not_the not_driving not_done not_by not_350 not_owners not_as not_well not_as not_some not_proud not_250 not_and not_150 not_owners not_as not_well not_I not_feel not_qualified not_to not_comment not_on not_one not_aspect not_of not_the not_vehicle Ford for designing a front end that fills my mirror and other too im sure with a view of serious design thinking and implementation im not not_trying not_to not_leave not_Chevy not_and not_Dodge not_pickup not_drivers not_out not_of not_this not_they not_can not_certainly not_be not_irritating not_in not_their not_own not_way but not not_with not_the not_panache not_of not_the not_Ford not_It not_may not_be not_Found not_On not_the not_Road not_Dead but ya gotta love the way it looks when it does My usual reaction to such foolishness is to ease off the gas a tad until we re both going about 10 mph slower so as to get an even better view of that fabulous front end and perhaps even sneak a peek at the smoke coming out of Zippy The Pinheads ears im not not_ready not_to not_switch not_vehicles not_just not_yet but it is a comfort to know that when the day arrives I need but to tap the brakes to facilitate some timely financing for my next vehicle Anyway congratulations That aspect would be the snappy space age appearance of the front end Pickups and Fords in particular used to take a perverse pride in being utilitarian and ugly but those days are over I can say this with complete certainty as I have been privileged to have been able to catch many a close up view of the lights grill design general aero look and ubiquitous Ford emblem in my rear view mirror usually while traveling at or slightly above the speed limit in the righthand lane Apparently this vehicle imbues its operator with the notion that it is made to be driven in the manner of a semi like real close to your rear bumper in the mistaken belief that such roadway bullying will cause me to speed up pull over or spontaneously combust
Neg,In all its a good looking truck that I would purchase again but only if they have fixed the potential problem with the drive line The F350 v10 Longbed Crewcab has a hidden problem that Ford has documented but does not not_freely not_inform not_the not_buyer not_that not_there not_is not_a not_problem not_with not_the not_rear not_drive not_line The vehicle was givin back although it had a comfortable riding with plenty of room for the family as well as for hauling Excellent power and fuel mileage for this large of a vehicle In that due to its length it has the potential to vibrate at highway speeds due to the angle inwhich the drive line sits I found out the hard way by purchasing this 35000 00 vehicle and dealing with the dealership run around The vehicle was returned due to the fact that they said that the problem could not not_be not_fixed but that it would not not_damage not_the not_vehicle not_to not_drive not_it not_that not_way not_That not_was not_all not_fine not_and not_dandy not_but not_when not_I not_asked not_them not_to not_put not_that not_in not_writing not_so not_that not_if not_that not_part not_failed not_they not_would not_fix not_it not_for not_as not_long not_as not_I not_owned not_the not_vehicle not_to not_me not_that not_means not_that not_we not_re not_not not_willing not_to not_back not_up not_our not_product not_but not_have not_a not_nice not_day
Neg,When its at the track we get just as many compliments on it as we do our 8 second camaro They are also beautiful on the weekend it makes a perfect truck to take out on the town and with the crew cab their is room for plenty of people I live in the Houston area so seing a big truck driving down the road isnt not_anything not_special but seing one of the new F350s crusin down the road just leaves me at a loss for words I love theese trucks They are solid work horses that can handle just about anything you throw their way We use them for pulling big 5th wheel car trailers to the race track and hauling our cattle trailers around but they are more than just work horse
Neg,The car held four people comfortably and the back seat was roomy The blue color we chose seemed to be very popular in the Detroit area The car was easy to get in and out of once you pushed the weatherstripping back into place This became my husbands hobby I am distressed that since we have sold our Escort my husband has no past time Only a four year olds tricycle has less power than the Escort that is if Dad is not not_pushing not_the not_vehicle not_from not_the not_back If you do daytime only driving the Ford Escort is the car for you In the two years of owning the car we had the pleasure of installing four headlamps and two taillights He sits sullenly looking at our non Ford Escort car and he begs me to let him replace the working headlamps in that car just for fun im still trying to get my husband interested in Parcheesi The engine noise was loud enough to drown out the words from the riders in the back seat and there were so many shake rattle and rolls in the body even the mechanic that worked on the car shrugged his shoulders and gave up trying to find the cause Driving this car is an enjoyable experience if it is the first car you have ever driven and have nothing to compare it to I would recommend this car for the little old lady crowd that drives 3 miles to the store and back every other Friday around noon during the brightest light of the day Anyone else takes the risk of needing a seeing eye car
Neg,The Ride and Steering The Passenger side mystifies me totally This one was going well until That includes the leg room area as well It can hold a full size garment bag as well The headlights and taillights are pretty good no complaints their Dashboard So trunk space is deffintley good on this car Quality and Craftsmanship The whole car feels like its been put together by plastic If you want to go Foreign go for Honda Or Toyota Camry And I definitely need my blinker because I was coming into heavy traffic So finally return the car to the Original Location and I finally stab another Taurus The ride is probably the big plus the rid is very smooth and very plush Which can be scary if you want to purchase a Ford Taurus And ford should be very ashamed presenting a car like this to the general public The passenger side Dash sticks out like 12 inches more then the Drivers side does So after I was finish with business I return the car told them the problem This was not not_so not_good not_as not_because not_it not_look not_like not_up not_ahead not_it not_was not_going not_to not_rain But some how it actually survived the trip and the return to its location Personally I consider the reliability to be very poor My major complaint is the fact you cant not_tell not_what not_speed not_your not_doing not_theirs not_more not_line not_and not_dashes not_then not_their not_are not_actually not_speed not_postings What can I say the material is very cheap on all 5 I have rented the seats are already tearing in certain places This one actually had no problems Expect that the engine kept making this knocking sound ever time I accelerated Which concerned me a great deal So your thighs and your butt will start aching terrible Trunk Space The Trunk Space is actually pretty big and is probably the most major plus about this car The paint job is not not_very not_good not_though not_I not_have not_already not_notice not_on not_many not_rental not_cars not_I not_have not_rented not_the not_paint not_starting not_to not_wear not_away not_in not_places The cruise control decided to quit and not not_work not_anymore not_I tried everything to get it to work again but it failed to work Well boy was I wrong All of sudden when I went to do a lane change my blinkers werent working nor was the wipers working either So yet again another dangerous feature you will be studding the speedometer allot trying to figure out exactly what speed your going Moving on to the passenger side The trunk can hold two full size suit case one on top of each other and a travel suit case to the right of the full size suite cases and then it can hold some travel bins towards the front It becomes almost a point of aggravation you almost feel like ripping out the entire dash at times Anyway onto the drivers dash area I find the dash board to be pretty lit at night with red glows etc Theirs a button for everything on the dash A button for bass a button for treble for fade well you get the point With all these buttons its close to impossible to figure out while driving what button to press to change the radio station or change cd tracks Being that I rented at least 5 of these babies makes me wonder has ford just totally and completely lost it beyond all measure I dont not_even not_know not_where not_to not_start not_lets not_go not_with not_Exterior not_Exterior actually doesnt look to bad I would even go as far to say that it actually looks sleek and somewhat sexy It makes the interior look completely uneven when sitting in the car Also while where on the topic of passenger side dashboard we might as well bring up the fact that the passenger side dash is huge I mean my god its like something that came out of a horror movie or something the passenger side dash area literally takes up the entire passenger area So the passenger will be pushing his seat back all the way just to get the maximum amount of leg room he can achieve in the passenger side Bad side is in return the backseat person behind the passenger will become very cramp and will run out of leg room Plus when your in the car this looks really stupid because the Drivers seat is not not_equal not_to not_the not_passenger not_seat not_in not_anyway So I had another business affair I had to go on so Hertz yet again gave me another Taurus I was like what problem does this car behold for me now Driving down the road I thought come on something gotta go wrong well a hour of driving went by and nothing happen I was like men a Taurus without a problem Also the car always breaks down All 5 I have rented One I had the air conditioner fan go out The other I rented the Engine believe it or not not_just not_gave not_out and the car only had 5 000 miles on it I was just driving it down the road at 60mph and the all of sudden silence I called AAA I told them it was a rental car It so obvious that the designing and quality stop right at the air conditioning vents Considering Ford actually put a cd player in the car this time is quite surprising to me Finally they step out of the 1980s with the old cassette style I found the radio controls and cd controls to be very confusing and on more then one occasions they have almost proved fatal while I was driving Just to change radio stations is difficult while driving Considering the fact alone that changing cd tracks in the car is close to impossible The car itself is ok at best if everything is working correctly I don 146t know if I got a bad batch of Taurus or what But these Taurus folks where cars with less then 10 000 miles on them Personally I be very scared to buy one of these suckers in fear of god knows what going to go wrong with it Maybe the breaks could fail that would be great I wouldn 146t doubt it with the way the car was made So they went ahead and picked me up and drove me to the nearest Hertz and I ask the Hertz if they could ever tell me what was wrong with the car I was just curious the guy gave me his number and said call him up in about a week I did and he told me the shop quoted that the Engine had completely been shot he and I were surprised considering the car only had 5 000 miles on it He said the car was covered by warranty anyway So I was off in another Ford Taurus What was ford thinking when they did this I dont not_know not_Electronics not_ABS not_on not_some not_model not_Cd not_player not_radio not_Driver not_Information not_how not_many not_miles not_to not_E not_Average not_miles not_per not_gallon not_how not_many not_miles not_done not_Driver not_and not_Passenger not_side not_airbags not_Cd not_player not_quality is ok the speakers could be allot better and I do mean allot better Driver Information is nothing new ford should have done this years ago Radio quality is good IT comes with a trunk remote entry and keyless remote entry Leg Room I find overall leg room in the car to be very poor Infact the only seat that has the most leg room is the Driver seat and that is no joke either Seat Comfort All four seats are at first comfortable but after about and Hour of sitting in them they provide very little support The steering on the other hand is responsive but it always feels like it has a huge under steer which makes you feel like the car is going to lose it every time you take a steep turn Overall I believe that if you really have to buy a ford Taurus buy one used and drive it around and hopefully the used one will have had all the quirks worn out before you finally get to it I highly recommend that you dont not_buy not_this not_car not_The not_94 not_and not_95 not_model not_Taurus not_Was not_Taurus not_best not_year and that more then likely will be their last best year I think Ford should just scrape the ford Taurus or outsource the Ford Taurus to somebody that can really make it a fine car Considering that ford lowered that engine models from 3 8 to 3 0 which makes the newer model ford Taurus always seem under powered Ford is living in the past I do believe Ford needs to take a real hard look at the foreign cars and start implementing what the foreign have and that also includes the quality to I believe a better buy would be The Dodge Intrepid if you want American
Neg,I always wondered who bought that lemmon of a car until I had another encounter with it last week I purchased a 1991 Ford Explorer XLT 4x4 in the spring of 1991 I trusted Ford since my 1986 Bronco II 4x4 had lasted so long The whole exhaust system was leaking like mad and then the muffler fell off I replaced the whole thing with a borla unit A couple months later my first transmission failed But with another kid on the way I need 4 doors and extra interior space Since the Explorer at that tiem was basically a stretched Bronco II which in turn was a ranger with a backseat I decided to buy one The impresions were good I drove one and compared to the GMC Jimmy it was much roomier and so I ordered one I ordered a fully loaded XLT which had more options the way I ordered it than the standard Eddie Bauer The first 3 years were fine except for the squeaking doors the interir remained large and it drove nice and looked handsome and with my silver and blue two tone paint scheme there were no other explorers that looked like it Then things started going bad in 1994 By this time the explorer was looking elderly with a couple rust spots and with a bit of collusion damage to the rear bumper Soon after the hubs and 4 wheel drive system started giving me problems so I traded it in for 10 000 in july of 1996 for a new 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited 5 2 litre 4x4 It not not_only failed but beforehand it refused to shift out of second gear so it was constantly bouncing off redline I had my automatic transmissiion replaced out of my pocket A short time later in early 1995 that transmission completely failed while my son was driving it Another expensive 4 speed auto out of my pocket My younger son and I were in our current car a Lincoln Navigator 4x4 when on interstate 70 an older explorer that looked identical to our old soldier albiet grille less extremely dneted in rear left door ripped seats and cracked glass pulls out in from of us I remember asknig my son I wonder how many transmissions hes been through
Neg,The transmission was the last to go along with an overhauled 4x4 My complaints fuel pump anti lock brakes power steering transmission radiator overheats minor electrical problems starter alternator Id go for a full size Chevy Blazer staying American but I know Id be paying a higher price tag for it If I ever get another Explorer We had the first one for two years before it was totaled in an accident We were pretty happy with the car despite little things like the backseat armrests falling off ive always liked Fords and Explorers for that matter but my third one put me over the edge No warning just occasional temperature fluctuations from normal to way hot and back to normal To be general I like the size the feel steering and handling the design the price and the look The engine was very expensive to replace compared to other engine jobs my friends and family has encountered with other vehicles The third and current Explorer started off flawless and the previous owner gave us his personal guarantee that the car was in perfect mechanical condition Id buy a few years newer like 1994 1996 I hate looking at new car prices and I would surely opt for the Sport They really are fun cars and they are very moderately priced or at least as moderate as any used car today could be If I had a choice It probably was until it fell apart on us We had the car less than 3 months when on a short road trip the engine burnt up melted DIED We put 4 or 5 thousand dollars into it just to keep it alive that long Power steering went first then the brakes rotors pads calipers the works followed by hard starting and overheating The transmission was never replaced but it would have along with a badly leaking radiator if the anti lock brakes hadnt failed the right front tire locked up and totaled the car Another one bites the dust By the time the new engine was broken in the starter started to go the rear hatch power lock broke the oil pan and gasket needed to be replaced and the transmission started to slip The transmission hasnt been fixed yet but it is about to drop I dont not_think not_I not_have not_anything not_nice not_to not_say not_about not_this not_last not_Ford not_as not_it not_is not_a not_true not_lemon You d be amazed at the re occurances of many all of these problems in my three vehicles Maybe it was a bad year maybe we picked three lemons but they all fell apart When the time came we opted for another Enter the two door Sport I loved that car I felt very in control with it and it was incredibly maneuverable compared to the XLT or Eddie Bauer All three were bought used between 9 K and 12 K and all three were stock 1991 Explorers two Eddie Bauers and my favorite of the three a Sport First of all I like alot of things about Explorers The sound system was very mediocre considering it was their premium JBL setup I only wish I could learn my lesson about Explorers or Fords in general but I can say now that im probably not not_on not_my not_last not_Explorer It had plenty of room got better mileage had more zip was easier to wash performed better and was just a fun car to own Unfortunately it had every problem I mentioned before Power steering BAD fuel pump alternator transmission and electrical glitches passenger window didnt not_operate not_power not_locks not_were not_broken It is a very practical SUV it tackles most off road trails minus serious 4 wheeling it performs well it gets decent gas mileage 91 that is new ones are much more efficient it is easy to service and it comes from an AMAZING car company Ford helps define American cars
Neg,The backseats are really uncomfy despite the leather seats The only really obvious negative qualities is the backseats and the shocks We had to get a new one Overall good suv with nice features and a couple of halting problems A few years back 1991 to be exact my dad purchased a Ford Explorer used with about 20 000 miles for 10 grand It isnt not_horrible but if you hit a pothole it could throw you off the road Also on another note the engine began having some problems after 10 years At the time it was a good deal and it turned out to be a smart investment I enjoy the features it comes with nice stereo leather seats are comfy good for the outdoorsmen It doesnt raise up high enough for me it was uncomfy when I was 5 5 and now that im 6 feet it is killing me Also as someone getting a drivers license soon I have a permit I dont not_enjoy not_a not_bumpy not_ride not_I not_prefer not_my not_moms not_94 not_mercedes not_520SE not_I not_think not_it not_is not_the not_shocks not_that not_cause not_it not_to not_be not_so not_bumpy
Neg,This is not not_so not_with not_this not_truck The problems Ford and Firestone are having come as no surprise to me On a typical passesnger car a blown tire may cause a collision but definately not not_a not_roll over Usually the most danage suffered by a motorist with a blown tire is a damaged wheels I drove a 91 explorer on a road trip from Texas to New York I beleive it was a 2 wheel drive XLT model with all options except leather seats This truck was nice in that it provided a nice view of the road felt strong during all driving conditions and provided more than the required cargo rrom for all of my gear The safetly issue when through my mind back in 1993 when I took the trip Firestone my have designed a bad tire but the trck is also to blame for so many deaths and injuries The wheel base is way too short and the center of gravity is way too high for a vehicle that is so massive People are sort of lured into a fasle sense of security with these things Just because its classified as an SUV they think tahy can do anything and go anywhere However there was a huge downside to all of this To put it as simply as it can be said the truck constantly felt like it was out of control Braking distances were super long it bobbed and wallowed over the smallest raod imprefections and every turn made me wonder if a roll over was going to happen Ford did a terrible job of engineering this thing The thing that is most shocking about this is how people have continued to buy this truck after the safety issues surfaced I suppose that can be attrbuted to SUVs being status symbols instead of practical transportation Face it if you have children admit that you do and dnt try to be all tough and rugged looking in one of these death traps Money would be better spent of a station waggon of some type from a BMW 3 series for the snooty sort to the Volvo for safety minded people to American wagons i e taurus for economy buyers I really hope the congressional hearings uncover some type of cover up by Ford and result in a massive recall where all Explorers are bought back from owners and scapped we will all be safer
Neg,UPDATE The cup holders Three Rivers Stadium parking gridlock The turn signal wiper stalks are located perfectly It has happened it is a bummer The vent open close gates seem to be the main culprit It feels composed and confident right up to the tires adhesive limits Either the speedo cable unspooled and trashed the speed sensor or vice versa It just feels good in my hands and is very comfortable on any length car trips The car was hesitating badly so I took it to my friendly neighborhood Ford garage The cost of this repair was around 150 New speedo cable and speed sensor at 110k miles They did the work under warranty even though it ran out at 36 k This gasket is made of a fibrous material and is either nickel or aluminum plated around the intake openings The cruise control layout is typical Ford and the buttons have bumps and depressions for intuitive use at night The 2 5 V6 is just as smooth revving as it has ever been even at 120k miles The original spring loaded virtually useless for anything but a can pair of cup holders are long gone Who says that all Ford service departments are worthless Not I Coil Pack replaced at around 75 k miles The steering action is fairly quick with about 2 75 turns lock to lock and has a nice moderately weighted feel The handling dynamics of this car are just awesome My Contour corners predictably and almost completely flat with little nose movement during accel deccel At this point with 120k plus on the odometer im traveling into territory where few Fords have gone before It is almost like a neat little science experiment and sporadic repairs averaging around 300 beat the crap out of a 300 monthly payment It is not not_the not_fastest not_or not_most not_powerful not_engine not_in not_this not_class but it has plenty enough to move a light little Contour around quite nicely Well at the bottom of this review I stated that I would keep the tour unless something major went it did The drivers side bearing started to sing the passengers side bearing was fine but it made sense to replace both as a preventative measure At 124 400 miles the power steering rack failed Since the V6 contour is relatively rare blah blah it was going to freakin expensive to fix The center console is well laid out contains one cup holder more on that later and has useful storage under the armrest Finally my favorite interior features are the front seats Other than that it shifts smoothly though it is definitely due for a fluid change Interior Likes FoMoCo did their homework here the control layout ergonomics are excellent The large sweeping instrument pod houses all of the controls surfaces a drivers side vent both of the center vent ducts a handy little bin for change a clock and a useful storage bin underneath the radio One of the cylinders was misfiring This repair cost about 215 New water pump at 90 k miles Anyone familiar with the 2 5 Duratec knows that this is a common occurrence The center armrest is for one elbow only preferably mine but it doesnt always work that way A coin flip or scissors paper rock are useful methods for determining armrest custody on longer drives So I worked out a deal with the dealership that I would buy another car from them if they covered the repair I know another ford I must be insane right As earlier stated ive had this car for a long time and it is after all a Ford so im probably going to miss something Fuel injectors replaced at around 40 k miles The replacement unit graciously supplied by my friend is a slightly more useful though just as cheap single unit which I make sure is in the closed position during any current and future trips to Pittsburgh sporting events They are completely visible and can be operated with just extended finger tips while leaving the rest of my hands on the wheel I think this design was copped from VDub but who cares it works The unlocking mechanism for the gas lid only works in colder weather During the summer months I must open the trunk and use the auxiliary unlock lever located there a minor inconvenience A few rattles emanate from the dash area most notably from the vents The center stack is skewed slightly towards the driver giving easy reach to the radio and HVAC controls lending an overall cockpit driver oriented feel to the cabin All of the window and lock switches as well as oddly enough the door handles are nicely backlit There is also some rattling where the windshield meets the dash which I believe started after the original windshield was replaced Repairs I ll list what I can remember with an approximate mileage and some comments The headrest is quite useful as it can be adjusted forwards as well as up and down to a point where you can actually rest your head on it while driving Dislikes

to operate though the lock switch is perfectly located to be bumped thus locking the door when exiting the vehicle which is nice when you actually intend to lock the door not not_so not_nice when you are say going to pump gas and leave your keys in the ignition What ever happened the speedometer and cruise control took a break and the atx went into limp mode which means no overdrive and rough shifting Though it felt like there was something seriously wrong with the car and that might have been it for old Bessie but the new parts were only 80 and the repair was simple enough for me to do it myself New intake gasket at 117 k miles The brakes seem very grippy to me As that I live in a somewhat rural area I have engaged in interesting maneuvers with deer on several occasions over the years managing never to hit one thanks to the handling and brakes Also as that I live in a Great Lakes region somewhat rural area I can say that the abs feature has kept me out of many a ditch and minor fender bender during the winter months Dislikes In this department these are mostly minor quibbles but in the interest of parity I ll list them anyhow Tire and brake wear seem to be a bit excessive to me I average about 24 months out of a set of tires 205 60r15 and only about 18 months before im in need of new brake rotors although the brake pads last about double that Due to my semi aggressive driving habits I cant not_really not_fault not_FoMoCo not_for not_the not_aforementioned not_problems For me at 5 10 and 185 lbs the drivers seat in the SE is extremely well side bolstered offering great lateral support during cornering However it might be a tight fit and or downright uncomfortable for people that are much wider than I am The seat bottom is also well bolstered and usefully long enough so that it doesnt cut off mid thigh like most any other car I have ever driven does im not not_that not_tall and I dont not_have not_particularly not_long not_legs not_so not_why not_is not_this not_the not_case not_car not_designers Well I guess in this blame someone else culture I can fault FoMoCo for making the Contour too fun to drive Another minor quibble that started at about 110k miles is that occasionally the rear suspension will emit a squawk during quick shifts in load mostly on quick right turns I believe I have isolated this problem to the rear anti roll bar bushings which I will replace when the weather warms up around here Finally the communicative steering and taut suspension that make the SE so enjoyable when driven hard lead to a somewhat rough on the back side ride on uneven pavement not not_for not_everyone not_Engine not_Transmission not_Likes It is equipped with the 2 5 Duratec V6 with atx power locks windows mirrors cruise control traction control 4 wheel disc abs brakes and the sport suspension Even after 6 years of ownership I still thoroughly enjoy driving my Contour I wont lie and say that ive never had any problems with it However the problems have mostly been minor and my Contour has never stranded me anywhere nor has it ever failed to start Below I will try to list my likes and dislikes about the car and as many of the repairs as I can remember I have had the car 6 years so I ll probably forget something Steering Handling Likes First of all I love the thick leather wrapped steering wheel The plating eventually wore away and the fibrous material degraded to the point where the many small individual openings became several large openings which in turn caused the engine to idle poorly I left this repair to the professionals at the Ford garage for a cost of 250 Very early on before 36 k miles there was something wrong with my gas peddle where on an intermittent basis I would push it and nothing would happen I dont not_remember not_what not_exactly not_was not_wrong and the problem was fixed under warranty I should note that im not not_much of a motorhead meaning that I dont not_particularly not_enjoy

Neg,That repair cost me 800 Summer 2000 An entire generation will be anti Ford I bought a used Contour in 1998 The blower switch only operates on the level 3 It took a while to accomplish this About 300 total cost My kids will know the same when they get older Other problems continue to surface that become more important to repair Tire blow out The car had to be aligned and I had to buy 4 new tires The car still makes a rattling noise underneath and makes a thumping sound when I am sitting at a light I can actually feel the thump The car began to make this horrible noise I was told by a mechanic that it was the Sway bar Another 100 Fall 2000 Winter 2001 Power steering fluid leak The mechanic said that the car was so badly out of line he wanted to know how it got that way 600 for tires and a serious alignment Summer 2000 That gets pretty hot in the winter I have to ride with the back windows down while the hot air blows into my face Please understand that I keep all oil changes The engine sensor came on It began to make a loud humming noise I dragged it to the dealer and they told me that it had something to do with emissions The sad thing about it is Ford does not not_seem not_to not_back not_their not_product not_Once not_I not_get not_out not_of not_this not_I not_will not_never not_step not_foot not_into not_another not_Ford not_even not_if not_the not_price not_is not_right The truth about the Contour did not not_wait not_too not_long not_to not_rear not_its not_ugly not_head not_Six not_months not_later not_the not_transmission not_began not_to not_slip not_Although not_it not_was not_still not_covered not_under not_warranty not_I not_had not_to not_still not_pay not_100 not_Summer not_1999 For the last year I have been driving 20 k per day Before it was 80 k per day for about a year I have paid for regular break work tune ups and transmission checks tire rotation I have one cup holder At that time it had 34 k miles on it I wanted the car right when I saw it and wanted it even more after test driving I had some trouble getting the car to pass MD inspection Minor stuff Brakes etc The car was great Others would look at the car in awe and I loved it The car offered speed and comfort and made me feel like a queen on the road I was able to keep up with the big dogs on the road Nice right The engine light is coming on and off again I have not not_had not_this not_one not_checked not_out yet I cant not_afford not_it not_Ford not_will not_charge not_me not_80 not_for not_a not_diagnostic not_test not_Imagine not_how not_many not_times not_I not_have not_paid not_that not_Since not_the not_summer not_of not_2000 not_my not_air not_conditioner not_has not_not not_worked not_I not_cannot not_afford not_to not_pay not_for not_it not_Perhaps not_later The dealer fixed the leak and charged me 400 5 days later the car had no power steering and the fluid leak was worse than before I took the car back and the dealer told me that the engine mounts were bad Another 400 Fall 2001 Speedometer goes out The car needed speedometer cables Another 320 I am dealing with this issue right now Fall 2001 And can someone please tell me how is it that the break lights go out so quickly I would estimate that I have spent close to if not not_more not_than not_4000 on this car since I purchased it Everyone who knows me is waiting for that next event I have 18 more payments left I have decided to wait it out Once it is paid for I will be very happy I am a single parent of 3 and this car is bleeding us
Neg,The main seal at the flywheel began to leak prodigiously It does seem to have a lot of road noise though I bought this car as a second vehicle and used it only for work in another city The car only had 79 K miles on it All during this time the car simply disintegrated In conclusion even when the car ran fine I could not not_get not_even not_close not_to not_the not_book not_values not_and not_finally not_sold not_it not_for not_50 not_above not_wholesale In addition the car required over 1700 in repair bills for just 8000 miles of wear Needless to say I would not not_recommend not_the not_Contour The cup holder had long since broken off due to its flimsy design After the radiator was fixed for 400 it ran fine for the next six thousand miles In freezing weather it also had a distinct knock from the timing belt slapping the top of the timing belt cover After the engine warmed up and the metal expanded the knock would stop The car also had a distinct oil smell in the air conditioning system when I stopped at traffic lights I had to re seat the valve cover gasket taken off for the timing belt because it is a poor design and is easily mangled during installation It was a GL model with an automatic transmission and 72 K miles on it I paid 5350 for the car and it had a leaking radiator when I bought it The owner prior to me was trying to sell the car for over 6000 and I was the only offer Thinking the timing belt was simply stretched I had it replaced for 300 including new ignition wires and plugs I never drove it in freezing weather again so I do not not_know not_if not_the not_new not_belt not_corrected not_the not_problem not_Since not_I not_moved not_to not_a not_new not_city not_I not_tried not_to not_sell not_the not_car not_for not_the not_retail not_price The car also began to hesitate severely I believe this was tied to the Check Engine light which began illuminating periodically Finally the car would not not_always not_start not_which not_I not_believe not_was not_a not_failing not_starter not_solenoid not_I not_eventually not_sold not_it not_for not_5000 but had to split the repair costs with the new owner No takers no phone calls I lowered the price to 1000 under retail with still no takers or phone calls Finally I had to ship the car to my new address Again I tried to sell the car for 5700 i e half way between retail and wholesale according to edmunds com with not not_one not_single not_phone not_call in the entire Seattle area I finally offered the car for 5200 which is only 250 above wholesale I only got three phone calls
Neg,We left the car at the dealership and havent seen it again I feel sorry for the next sucker to lease buy it Well one day just driving down the road in 1997 the car just stopped running After all was said and done the engine had seized No one to this day has been able to explain this to us since it had oil in it was a well maintained car Cost to repair 3 000 My husband and I leased a 1995 Ford Contour 4D auto with air and power everything We were pleased with it at first but slowly became disillusioned About a month after we bought it both cup holders were broken which ever genius decided to put them between the front seats and made of such flimsy plastic ought to be fired Then the drivers seat broke you couldnt move it forward or backward come to find out the seats had been recalled so they replaced it free of charge took them almost a month to do it Then the blower for the heater air would only blow on low kind of cold to ride in in the middle of the winter in New Hampshire Cost to repair 350 which it stopped working again in about 3 months Lastly the engine light would come on and off and we took it to Ford they said a wire was loose causing this to happen
Neg,My advice to current owners The last straw came in May 1999 I purchased a 1995 Ford Contour in August 1997 The car had terrific handling and decent performance from the 2 0 liter 4 banger With my 100 deductible for each visit plus costs for non covered items this car was killing me financially My local Ford zone office manager refused to look at the car and further refused to offer any financial help For the first 6 months I thought I made a wise decision First it was the little things both spring activated cupholders broke To make a long story short during 1998 and early 1999 I was at my dealer 4 times for suspension related problems and 2 times each for tie rods and front wheel bearings As of July 2001 hes in the process of getting Ford to buy the car back under my states lemon law To any potential buyer you would be well advised to shop elsewhere And its not not_just not_the not_95s or the 4 cylinder automatics my cousin owns a 2000 Contour V6 5 speed which has been a disaster from day one specifically an oil leak that Ford cant not_seem not_to not_fix At 64 K miles exactly 1000 miles after the extended warranty expired the transmission dropped I dont not_care not_what not_car not_you not_drive but NO CAR should need a new rebuilt transmission at 4 years 65 K miles Why so long Turns out its nearly impossible to get the transmission parts because everything was on national backorder Plus my transmission guy informed me this was a throwaway design and by far the most difficult transmission job hes done He flat out told me the only way they would help me is if a court told them to Imagine that Great customer service huh I needed to fix the car but I wasnt not_going not_to not_let not_Ford not_touch not_it not_Instead not_I not_took not_the not_car not_to not_an not_independent not_transmission not_shop not_FIVE not_weeks not_and not_1800 not_later not_my not_car not_was not_back If you have had premature automatic transmission failure and have had to shell out a bunch of money let Ford know about it Theres no way you should get stuck for expensive transmission work on a throwaway transmission Ford would never admit it but im sure they know this car has been and will be a disaster for them No biggie but not not_covered not_under not_the not_extended not_warranty not_I not_passed not_on not_the not_service not_departments offer to replace them for 177 From there it was all downhill the blower motor for the heater stopped working 2 months later I was getting awful clunking groaning noises in the front end only to find my stabilizer bars and stabilizer links were shot Wouldnt you know that stabilizer bars ARE covered by the Ford extended warranty but stabilizer links ARE NOT He said he ll probably never do another Contour Mystique transmission again and if he did it would probably cost nearly double what he charged me After arming myself with a written statement from him as well as finding dozens of owner complaints online pertaining to the transmission I took another shot at Ford and threatened to litigate through my states Attorney Generals office Needless to say Ford would up settling with me nearly 3 months later for 1000 which was better than nothing By August 1999 I was totally fed up with this pile of rubbish and I traded it in for a 1998 Lumina which turned out to be a very smart move
Neg,What a amp load Now my story will may not not_be not_the not_typical not_ownership not_experience The factory sunroofs were nice in that they retracted into the roof fully The cars were nicely appointed with all the fixings you would expect on a premium SE model The car was all over the road and there was a strange thumping noise that got worse and worse One week later I was back in my car but immediately I knew something was not not_right They said they parked the car in the garage and an hour later it was fine The cars handled really nice when they were put together properly with the sportier handling on the SE versions The clutch was too new to be worn out and I am not not_a not_hard not_driver not_on not_clutches Some of my problems were dealer technician caused but the problems should have never been there in the first place It just so happened the dealer had a Toreador Red SE manual demonstrator model with 600 kilometres fully loaded except the CD player As the week wore on the grind got worse and worse until the car would no longer engage first gear hot or cold Back to the dealer Like everyone else I waited to see what Ford was going to replace the venerable Tempo Topaz model with and was surprised to see the new Contour The car had spend some time in the cold but was garaged at night I would not not_expect not_such not_cosmetic not_problems not_to not_surface not_for not_at not_least not_a not_couple not_years They called me to say they could not not_know not_what not_was not_wrong not_without not_dropping not_the not_transmission not_all not_on not_a not_2 not_month not_old not_car not_with not_1500 not_kilometres What I did notice on that 4 month old 1st car with barely 2000 kilometres disturbed me the nice grey leather seats had started to develop creases in the drivers seat leather This time the new transmission was working fine 2 days later back to the shop Turns out the mechanics had not not_completely tightened all the bolts on the front subframe assembly that cradles the transmission and motor So they took it apart and said the transmission 1st gear was faulty and needed to be replaced two weeks later and driving a dealer loaner my car was still not not_fixed That afternoon they called me and said this was normal to have your brake piston caliper slide pin freeze when you take a warm car out of a garage and into the cold So I went to get the car Well would you believe what happened two weeks later SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL again with the rear brakes locked didnt not_hit not_anything not_this not_time not_either This time the dealer had to deal with my wrath as I told them I was not not_going not_to not_pay not_my not_lease and they could stick that car where the sun didnt not_shine The parts were on terminal back order Mad as could be I fumed at the service manager and many calls later to Ford customer service in Canada the dealer had a brand new replacement whole transmission being shipped from the Kansas assembly plant Whats more as the motoring press praised the new car especially the upscale Duratec V6 SE model I thought I should go visit my Ford dealer and see what the fuss was about as I was in the market for a replacement car It was a dream to drive and suited my single sport sedan lifestyle then things started to go wrong SERIOUS THINGS that no warranty covers you for One minus 20 morning I drove the car out of my garage and headed off to work The car was an absolute dream to drive a smooth powerful throaty V6 a nice 5 speed and wonderfully supportive heated leather seats with these nifty airbag inflaters that blew up for lumber support etc I am in Canada and leather on a minus 30 degree celsius day can really be uncomfortable The 4 wheel disk brakes and the traction control did a nice job of getting the car moving and stopping even with the sport Firestone radials on the icy roads we have here in Canada I cant not_say not_to not_much not_about not_the not_gas not_mileage not_as not_I not_never not_did not_get not_to not_drive not_the not_cars not_enough My dad summed it up best quot never buy a new model car wait a couple years until the bugs are worked out or at best buy your car at the end of its product cycle even it it doesnt seem as new anymore quot I think he was spot on with the 95 96 Contour SE models br br The car also had a really nice traction control system and this seemed like the car of my dreams and was a great winter driver Being 2 months old and 3000 under list price made it a good deal plus it qualified for new car leasing So I signed a 24 month lease and drove it away late that week Well for the first month I loved that car No sales manager has ever heard such a mad customer as I tore up my lease on the phone A tow truck came and took the car away Two days later the dealer had me a brand new identical 1996 Contour SE V6 the only difference was this one was automatic with a CD player my new girlfriend wanted an automatic and the dealer gave me exactly what I asked for Same colour sunroof leather etc etc What I did like about these cars was the Duratec V6 was a dream to drive when it worked the fit and finish was OK for a domestic car the value for money seemed good the cars were nimble and sporty to drive the back seat 95 was a bit cramped but I didnt not_usually not_have not_rear not_passengers and the 96 had rear seats that were scooped out to give more rear knee room What I found next was unbelievable behind the drivers seat the floor pan was protruding up about 4 inches and the rear carpet was soaked in gas I looked under the car and a pool of gasoline was all over the floor I poked my head under the car and it was clearly evident the car was hoisted incorrectly by someone at the dealer on the floorpan right along the fuel lines and one was ruptured That afternoon I was back in my car but now it was not not_driving not_straight not_pulling not_right not_but not_was not_tight not_5 not_minutes not_out not_of not_the not_dealership not_the not_engine not_error not_light not_came not_on but I was too mad and tired I just drove it home and parked it in the garage Next morning I got up and went to the garage and thought I could smell gasoline I got in the car and the smell was unbearable They calmed me down and called me later to say that they had noticed a few of the new Contours rear disk calipers brakes slide pins were not not_lubricated not_properly not_from not_the not_factory and they had done this to mine and that it was now better then new So I went to pick up the car Two weeks later brakes were now working great I noticed that the car was starting to get a slight grind putting the car into first My current car a 93 Honda Accord SE has 168 000 kilometres and the leather looks like new I am not not_a not_big not_guy and the seats are treated with the same leather conditioner I treated the Ford leather with The dealer took care of the lease and paid the cost differences to keep me happy on the replacement Contour that car lasted 1 month until on one cold Canadian morning I started the car and the starter motor stuck burned out and exploded into several pieces doing quite a bit of damage under the hood Ford cancelled my lease and I have never put foot in a Ford dealership again The leather seats were really comfortable and very adjustable to any driver Driver leg room was good I am a tall guy and the telescopic tilt steering wheel could be set up nicely I never got to test the cruise control steering wheel mounted on my first car nor on the second as it never worked on the replacement car Would I recommend one of these cars I think you can answer that if you have read this far I dont not_know not_if not_I not_had not_really not_bad

day of winter especially newer cars I was driving about 40 kilometres an hour through a 8 lane intersection when a school bus decided to turn in front of me I turned clear and hit the breaks and next

Neg,The cost to replace it How about 68 The first one was a 1987 Ford Escort bought new Then the engine light starts coming on and off randomly My husband and I bought a 1995 Ford Contour GL 4 door sedan I have owned two different Ford cars in my life and am not not_impressed not_with not_either not_one We take it to several different places nothing is found to be wrong The rear doors start making this horrible screeching noise when they re opened WD 40 has no effect The cupholder is still broken to this day Next the fan switch stops working Well it works but only on the lowest speed If you turn it up it turns off completely Visualize us desperate for some a c with our faces pressed close to the dash vents That was only the beginning of problems with that car needless to say 10 years later I am persuaded to give Fords another chance It seemed pretty nice at the time with about 30 000 miles on it We have it only a couple of weeks when the cup holder breaks Now this may not not_seem not_like not_a not_big not_deal but they are made of very flimsy plastic and I accidentally set my purse on it which totally snapped it off It broke down on the freeway less than a month after purchasing it needed a new engine head and was in the shop for two weeks waiting for parts from Detroit The latest is that the transmission sounds like its starting to slip I dread the thought of a 1500 tranny repair cost All I want to do is unload this car but unfortunately Fords do not not_hold not_their not_values not_that not_well not_and not_we not_probably not_could not_barely not_sell not_it not_for not_what not_we not_owe not_on not_the not_loan not_I not_will not_never not_buy not_another not_Ford not_again not_I not_know not_some not_people not_swear not_by not_them but I have owned many Honda Toyotas and Nissans that served me much better and I think I ll go back to what I can depend on
Neg,Although this is a trifling problem by comparison with the other woes ive had with the Contour the ergonomics are poor The car has also developed a head gasket leak and drips oil on the exhaust manifold creating a most unpleasant smell when the car is warm I bought the Contour in November 1975 as a second car About a month after I drove it off the lot I started hearing a rubbing noise from the front In addition this car chews tire suspension and brake components with reckless abandon ive been through two sets of rotors both front and rear three sets of disc brake pads and two sets of tires The problem turned out to be a front stabilizer bar bushing Unfortunately the bushing is pressed onto the bar at the factory so you have to buy the entire assembly another Ford better idea profit maximization at the expense of the customer In the summer of 97 the engine cooling fan fried and the blower switch to the heater air conditioner stuck in the low position After spending almost 500 to replace the cooling fan and fuse assembly I just received a recall notice from Ford almost 4 years later The extended warranty refused to cover the repair so I was out approximately 185 A short time later my check engine light kept coming on The problem was diagnosed as a defective exhaust gas sensor Once again the extended warranty company wouldnt not_pay not_for not_the not_estimated not_200 not_repair not_since not_it not_was not_not not_a not_covered not_component not_Fords not_emission not_warranty not_likewise not_passed not_the not_buck not_despite not_the not_fact not_that not_the not_sensor not_is not_part not_of not_the not_emission not_control not_system The power door lock button is located so close to the armrest that ive locked the keys in the car on a few occasions getting out and I might be the luckiest Contour owner on the face of the earth because the cheap plastic springloaded cupholders in my car still havent broken yet imagine that This is the 11th Ford product ive owned since 1978 and the most trouble prone of the lot It will definitely be my last
Neg,The engine is loud the V4 and doesnt have a very smooth sound They said that the car was plagued with recalls and was not not_very not_reliable The drive was decent nothing too notable Compared to the Celica I had it rode up high But there is always a feeling owning this car that it is going to break down any time There were some knocking too that had nothing to do with the type of gas I was giving it I had also spoken too other people who had owned the car and their opinion was more negative than mine But overall there are much better choices out there I traded it in for Toyota and I am very happy with that The comfort level i e the confidence in the car owning the Toyota is much higher than it was for the Ford If you can find a good deal on a Contour a really good deal go for it but otherwise keep searching I purchased this vehicle after driving my 86 Toyota Celica to the ground delivering pizzas I was then done with that job and wanted a decent car to last me a long time I found a two year old Contour for 9000 and decided it was a good deal and got it And in fact it hasnt been a horrible car Despite a few recalls it keeps running with minimal maintenance I think the worst problem I had was that the tires needed replaced The V4 didnt not_have not_a not_lot not_of not_muscle not_despite not_the not_fact not_that not_my not_Contour not_had not_a not_manual not_transmission not_I not_am not_certainly not_glad not_I not_didnt not_get not_the not_Automatic not_All not_in not_all not_it not_was not_a not_good not_car not_while not_we not_owned not_it not_We not_traded not_it not_in not_after not_it not_had not_65 not_000 not_miles not_I not_didnt not_want not_to not_press not_my not_luck not_any not_further not_Speaking not_of not_trade not_in not_I not_didnt not_get not_much not_for not_it not_2 not_k not_for not_a not_1995 not_I not_know not_I not_could not_have not_gotten not_more not_but not_not not_much not_more
Neg,It was 100 000 miles or 56 months Next the drivers side head rest broke 280 to fix They are ade from flimsy plastic located in between the front seats If your transmission goes it ll run about 2000 to 3500 to fix rebulid or replace My second issue is with Ford itself I purchased my car and purchased the 100 000 mile power train warranty I have had nothing but problems with my contour since I bought it Within two weeks the cup holders broke Get this my transmission failed 1 day after the warranty 56 Mos was up My advice is if you own one rid yourself of this car fast These include front strut springs both of mine failed within a week of one another Others include under hood wiring Heater blower switch and heater fuse So needles to say I dont not_have not_a not_headrest not_in not_my not_car not_that not_is not_functional not_Numerous not_factory not_recalls and as Ford terms them extended warranties These are just the ones that I have had problems with I recently found that this car has a 30 fail rate in transmissions above 75 000 miles If your going to buy one dont And always ask a Ford dealership what kind of transmission is in the car If they say CE4E then laugh and walk away Are you kidding me almost 1 in every 3 I know because Ford uses a type CE4E transmission that they have known is problematic since they started using it in 1994
Neg,It has horrible breaks They fade very quickly The car had bad resale value It was already a lemon under warranty I purchased a 95 Contour GL in Aug of 97 for 9000 The cup holder broke kwik the headlight plastic lense turned dark yellow deminishing light output My mechanic friend replaced it and ins not not_a not_good not_sign not_when not_a not_pro not_complains not_about not_your not_car The alternator failed I had to replace the battery twice and the alternator was very very hard to remove and replace The throw out bearing in the tranny was about to go out at 63 k miles when I sold the car in Feb of 00 It had only 29 k kiles on it It had the 2 0 four cylinder and 5 speed Before the warranty expired the deal replaced free the rack and pinion steering syste the A C blower condenser and evaporator and did some recall service If you want a cheap car that breaks a lot and has no resale value buy the Contour If you want a cheap car that is dependable and has decent resale value buy a 95 altima from nissan The back seat was very small Everyone complained Handling was bad too I replaced the tires with some Michelin Roadhandler Sports from Sears and made a huge differance in cornering Excellent tires can make up for a bad car The only good thing was that my MPG never dropped below 23 MPG in the city I routinly averaged 30 31mpg on long out of town trips and the seats and fron leg room was comfortable im 6 00 with long arms and legs
Neg,The glitches have finally been sorted out its about time That alone would have cost me around 4000 CDN if it werent for the extended warranty The car has 4 wheel discs with ABS so the brake job was rather expensive but obviously necessary Now for the bad aspects No matter what kind of car I get next even if it were a Ferrari I will miss the Contour However the time has come to sell the car and get something new A VW Golf GLS 1 8T is a definite prospect The car is in good repair right now except for the resonator which is bad just due to age but the rest of the exhaust system is looking all right The waterpump and its gasket blew in the summer some ABS regulator blew at the same time the low speed fan and some other components broke 2 days after I got the car back from the aforementioned repairs As for the bad resonator I think I ll leave it be because if I fix it something else is bound to go wrong I can live with a slightly louder than normal exhaust system The splash shield has been rattling around badly and actually fell off after the fan was replaced since it wasnt not_reattatched not_properly not_ive not_had not_some not_dash not_lights not_burn not_out and I have also had a tie rod break somehow dont not_ask not_I not_dont not_know It hasnt been the most reliable car by any means but it has definitely been a great driving car it still puts an ear to ear grin on my face when I drive it High performance out of a sleeper sedan I love it My ownership has definitely been characterized with a love hate type relationship with this car I love it when it works I hate it when its in the shop This is an update on the report I wrote a while ago on my car I currently have 108 000 kms on the odometer and have had some more serious problems since the last review I still maintain my opinions about the awesome driving dynamics of the car and the powerful and delightfully high revving V6 engine that powers it Every time I drive the car it never ceases to amaze me and amuse me I absolutely love the engine It sounds so great and is more than adequate to move the car along I still waste much more gas than I should but I cant not_resist not_the not_beautiful not_music not_the not_motor not_makes not_when not_it not_reaches not_top not_RPMs and the corresponding pull it develops I recently had the brake pads and rotors replaced since the originals were warped and had hairline cracks developing due to age but hey 106 000 kms out of the original brakes is really something especially considering that this car has been DRIVEN
Neg,The Ford Mustang They are cop magnets for some reason The Ford Mustang corners like there is no tomorrow There are too many safer cars on the market The dark inconspicuous color of my husbands car probably saved us both from numerous tickets This car is NOT in ANY WAY suitable for teenagers or inexperienced drivers My husbands dream car I really want this car he says One time I realized I was doing 80 mph in a 45 zone YIKES While the leg area was very ample and could easily accommodate my husbands 6 3 frame the seats were very narrow Another thing dont not_buy not_these not_cars not_in

what is insurance for says he Indeed Unlike many men with new vehicular toys my husband actually tried to encourage me to drive his car But those close gears could make missing a gear easy for inexperienced manual transmission drivers so I would practice on an old VW bug before driving this type of car if you have not not_had not_a not_lot not_of not_practice not_with not_clutches not_and not_gears The gas mileage we got was about 18 mpg in the city and a bit more on the freeway Not good but not not_horrendous either Additionally insurance rates are pretty high for this type of vehicle as you can well expect We had 3 cars and not not_a not_single not_one of them was a safe large reliable vehicle for a family of 6 I felt bad about my husbands dream car flying the coop but I had to relinquish my truck as well so my sympathy level diminished rapidly This was not not_a not_problem not_for not_me not_because not_I not_have not_been not_driving not_manual not_transmissions not_since

and I went out with our oldest son I got stuck hunkering in the back After a while I just stayed home Acceleration is needless to say very fast My insurance company USAA put out a book which rated the safety level of most of the popular cars and the MUSTANG did not not_score not_very not_well not_in not_any not_category not_despite not_the not_dual not_airbags not_and not_anti not_lock not_brakes

dual lighted vanity mirrors rear shoulder harnesses driver and passenger bucket seats fully adjustable power driver side seat air conditioning and lots of other nifty little extra features that any self respecting car should sport My chunky lil bootie just barely fit comfortably A very large hipped person would not not_be not_able not_to not_fit not_in not_those not_seats and if they did manage to squeeze in they would have the seatbelt latch digging into their outer thighs Additionally the back area is so small that only very small adults or children 12 and under can really ride in any semblance of comfort Yes im sure you do So I dutiful spousal unit that I am re arranged our family budget to include the extra insurance and payment that would trail the joyous ownership of such a car And so it was that he left one day and came home with a flashy hunter green Mustang Such a pretty car Well it was pretty until this one certain woman my husband is married to accidentally ripped off the driver side door The tiny mirrors did not not_help not_matters not_much not_at not_all not_Had not_we not_installed not_a not_wink not_mirror not_I not_probably not_would not_have not_felt not_better not_about not_driving not_the not_car but we never got around to that because my husband liked it just fine he is much taller though and does not not_find not_his not_nose not_hitting not_the not_dashboard and he mainly drove it The 5 speed manual transmission shifted fairly smoothly but the gears seemed to be very close together The combination of hormones inexperience and speed

he did However at the time I had my own broomstick a Ford F150 4x4 Flareside truck I had no interest in his puny car but I did drive it once in a while when he stole my truck and following is a summary of that I think of this vehicle This car reminded me of a song by the band ALABAMA called im in a Hurry A line in the song goes my cars not not_new but it ll zero to sixty in 5 2 While that

not_car not_because not_you not_simply not_do not_not not_realize not_how not_fast not_you not_are not_going not_I not_had not_to not_constantly not_be not_on not_my not_guard The low center of gravity and wide wheel base helps the car hug the road on even the sharpest corners Again however this can lead to disaster when drivers become over confident and misjudge either the sharpness of the corner their own ability to control the car or both Follow the suggested speed limits on corners at all times especially in this car because it is easy to loose control when you go 90 mph on a 20 mph curve I would recommend this car to responsible singles and couples The glove compartment in the front passenger side contains the trunk popping mechanism and the center console has a nice divided change holder and cassette cd holder thingie Everything is pretty much within arms reach while driving In spite of the positive points and pure flash value I did not not_enjoy not_driving not_this not_vehicle and actually avoided it I found that the bucket seats put me far too close to the ground and I felt like I was in the cockpit of an airplane trying to peek out over the dashboard Yeah as if I have ever sat in the cockpit of an airplane I felt unsafe and nervous because I could not not_see not_very not_well not_behind not_me not_around not_me not_or not_even not_in not_front not_of not_me
Neg,The stereo average The gas mileage good The trunk is small When will I learn The pick up was sluggish The seats were low and not not_comfortable We were thrilled with the car 6 cylinder The convertible is easy to open and close By that time I was out of my mind Our problem began about 12 months after owning the car See my review on the 1995 amp 2000 Mustangs Same problems different years The Mustang is neat to look at but a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT We drove it here we drove it there Its seemed like a nice car but typical Mustang When the service manager opened his drawer I saw a notice for Mustang torque converters and I asked him about that and he fessed up We were disappointed in the 1995 Mustang when the engine blew after owning it 8 days it was brand new and then the transmission went later The cup holder was situated over the button that makes the top go up and down and the water dripped onto the button and I was waiting for it to short out some day If only Ford would build a good reliable Mustang I would buy one despite their MAJOR FLAWS but they dont not_We not_now not_own not_an not_Explorer not_Sports not_Trac not_Lets not_see not_how not_that not_goes After we got all our money back from our 1995 Mustang Convertible due to the Lemon Law in Florida we used that money to order another new Mustang but instead of the white color we ordered the Laserred with the camel color top and interior The torque converters are bad and they have a quiet recall because they dont not_have not_enough not_torque not_converters not_to not_replace not_on not_all not_the not_Mustangs and they could only fix the ones with SEVERE problems Again this is the second Mustang with BIG problems We had the car for 20 months and I wasnt not_about not_to not_go not_the not_Lemon not_Law not_route not_so not_I not_told not_my not_son not_we not_would not_buy not_the not_2000 not_GT not_Convertible not_and not_trade not_this not_problem not_vehicle not_in not_I not_had not_read not_that not_the not_GT not_didnt not_have not_problems not_with not_the not_torque not_converter not_WRONG not_AGAIN On a hot day in south Florida with the top up the a c didnt not_cool not_like not_it not_should not_because not_the not_sun not_beats not_down not_on not_the not_canvas not_top not_and not_there not_isnt not_any not_insulation not_so not_all not_the not_heat not_enters not_the not_car not_Theres not_no not_room not_in not_the not_back not_seat not_for not_people not_to not_sit not_it not_is not_only not_good not_for not_either not_babies not_or not_double not_amputees There was a vibration and we kept taking it in and they told us it needed to be aligned so they aligned it and it still vibrated After months of going back and forth with the vibration and 600 later for new tires they told us the tires were the cause and we purchased new tires I told them that I had the torque converter and transmission and engine go bad in our other Mustang but they told me it wasnt not_any not_of not_that not_it not_was not_in not_my not_mine
Neg,The legroom is cramped and tall people have a very difficult time riding in my car They have situated it so that the larger of the two holders is furthest back but it is so large the the average cup inevitably spills every time Then the seatbelt holder sticks out so far that as soon as you sit in the seat it hits the side of the door 1 locking the door and 2 creating a dent in the plastic on the door The smaller of the two holders holds the cup comfortably however it is so close to the stick shift that it makes it impossible to put a drink in it without knocking it over in the process of shifting gears The trunk is pretty good sized but dont not_try not_to not_put not_a not_large not_suitcase not_in not_there not_because not_the not_distance not_between not_the not_edge not_and not_the not_top not_is not_so not_small not_it not_prevents not_you not_from not_being not_able not_to not_get not_it not_in not_there not_I not_ll not_admit not_that not_its not_a not_pretty not_car not_but not_thats not_about not_it The high beam device turns on opposite you have to push it away from you rather than pulling it towards you like a normal car to every other car that I have ever driven which is frustrating when you try to pull it towards you out of habit I bought this vehicle in October of 1999 mostly because I was coerced and bullied by the salesmen at my local Ford dealership I liked the looks of it but being my first new car was extremely naive in how to go about purchasing one I had looked at a few other cars such as the Sebring the Dodge Stealth used the Camaro and the Avenger but never had the chance to really think about it and decide which one I liked best Anyway since then I have decided that I would never buy another Ford Mustang and would not not_recommend not_it not_to not_anyone not_First not_of not_all not_the not_pickup not_on not_the not_V6 not_engine is lame at best for such a sports car Secondly the interior is the most poorly designed that I think I have ever seen Lets start with something as trivial as the cup holders
Neg,But this is my last Mustang The adult in me limited myself to the V6 stupid adult After ten years I gave into my teenage cravings for a Mustang The trunk like the back seat is almost to small to be useful Much of the interior is not not_very not_well though out For example you can only put a drink in one of the two cupholders as one interferes with the stick shift I cant not_believe not_they not_let not_it not_go not_like not_that not_Performance not_is not_uninspiring not_Granted not_it not_is not_the not_V6 not_but not_my not_94 not_Probe not_4 not_cylinder not_was not_much not_more not_fun not_to not_drive They need a new category for the Mustang V6 Its not not_a not_compact not_and not_its not_not not_a not_sports not_car not_Its not_too not_big not_on not_the not_outside not_to not_be not_call not_a not_compact not_im not_sure not_Its not_worth not_noting not_that not_the not_car not_looks not_much not_bigger not_from not_the not_outside not_than not_it not_feels not_on not_the not_inside not_Kind not_of not_like not_Dr not_Whos not_Tartus not_in not_reverse not_I not_wil not_admit not_that not_the not_car not_is not_a not_pretty not_good not_bargain not_and not_I not_picked not_mine not_up not_as not_a not_year not_end not_clearout not_so not_I not_dont not_feel not_cheated The V6 with the sport package looks fabulous and in spite of being one of the most common cars on the roads gets complements from some those who cant not_tell not_its not_not not_a not_GT not_im not_sure not_Unfortunately thats all the good that can be said for it It is very cramped Anyone over 6 feet tall or who carries more than one passenger or who travels and needs to carry a lot of stuff should just pass on this car
Neg,Take one for a test drive and see for yourself This is not not_the not_kind not_of not_car not_i not_would not_like not_to not_own not_ever not_I not_guess not_I not_was not_spoiled not_after not_riding not_the not_Saab not_9 not_5 not_which not_is not_a not_lot not_more not_expensive not_you not_get not_what not_you not_pay not_for not_i not_suppose not_I not_find not_it not_hard not_to not_believe not_that not_a not_nicer not_sporty not_car not_cannot not_be not_built not_at not_this not_price not_range I rented one from Hertz while on a business trip since they were out of the reserved type and was looking forward to driving it since I had heard people rave about it I was quite disappointed actually the engine was loud this could be a plus for some it had a rough idle and was generally unrefined though powerful it did seem to smooth out over 60 mph somewhat the interior layout amp dash were ugly and badly designed it actually looked cheap i strongly felt i could have designed a better dash my tercel had a nicer cleaner smoother layout the power seat controls were difficult to reach im 6 1 and i had to actually get out of the car to properly adjust my seat
Neg,The only downfall is that the back seat is not not_very not_roomy By the way the electric adjustment on the drives seat is a must Right now my kids are small and there is plenty of room for them but I cannot not_see not_an not_adult not_being not_too not_comfortable not_sitting not_in not_the not_back not_seat The car handles really well and is easy to maneuver in and out of traffic I recommend this car to anyone in the market for a car with a sporty look at a decent price What I love about this car aside from its looks is the fact that the power is there when you need it It gets really good gas mileage and of course my kids love the fact that there is a horse on the steering wheel The first time I saw the Silver 1998 Ford Mustang I new I HAD to have it Needless to say I drove it home that day I bought the vehicle because it had the sporty appearance that I was looking for and it really was not not_that not_expensive not_compared not_to not_a not_lot not_of not_other not_sports not_cars
Neg,I bought a 1998 Mustang 6 cylinder in May of 1998 The car started out to be great but turned into a sour fruit shortly after If you do have money to burn and you do not not_expect not_much not_from not_your not_car then the Mustang is right for you The motor engine has been good so far except for this summer when the starter alternator and the battery gave out All of the problems I had with the car SHOULD have been covered under warranty But when I took the car in however they either said go to the manufacturer tires or we will TRY to fix it in which case most of the time it did not not_get not_fixed I have been told by many people that you either love your Mustang or you hate it I see it this way If you want something different from everybody else on the road and something that can handle normal car responsibilities then do not not_buy not_the not_Ford not_Mustang When I originally bought the vehicle I tinted the windows and put an alarm on it only to find that the power window module was poking holes in the tint After I had a couple of car fulls of people 5 I noticed that the back shocks were not not_holding not_up not_the not_body not_of not_the not_car not_as not_well not_as not_it not_should not_Not not_only not_that but at 18 000 miles the tires became bald Also after I was able to get used to the car I noticed that the seat belts were not not_retracting not_properly not_therefore not_leaving not_the not_seat not_belts not_hanging not_out not_of not_the not_car not_when not_I not_closed not_the not_door
Neg,This is a beautiful car Great styling very comfy The Mustang lacks quite alot in the performance area The convertible top is almost childlike in its ease of operation and the Mach 460 sound system is the best stock system that I have heard Now for the bad news To be the flagship sports car in Fords line of autos it is sadly disappointing I bought the Mustang after owning a 1998 Chevy Z 28 with a 6 speed transmission Supposedly these two are comparable cars Not Quite Though the Mustangs suspension rides nicer and sits better on the ground to allow for better cornering in the long run that doesnt remotely make up for the difference in power The Fords 4 6 liter engine though good on gas lacks the gusto of the 5 7 LS1 in the Camaro If you are in the market for a great looking comfortable ride in a car that has a sports car imagine but passes up most gas stations due to the lack of raw power this is the car for you But if you want an all out beast and want to get your moneys worth in a so called sports car I suggest you pass up the Ford dealership and head for the nearest Bowtie shop
Neg,October 1997 Ford not not_including not_floor not_mats Then you d start getting interesting results The seats are also more comfortable than average The Mustang was new clean runned smoothly and quiet and smelled NEW Then I quickly realized that it was NOT a SPORT car at all They are not not_good not_enough not_for not_that not_power not_plant not_and not_on not_the not_rain not_better not_stay not_under not_2000 not_rpm Tires went slick fast though Quiet ride for a sport car it rides smoothly and is quiet The competition just left the Mustang behind in the dust as far as performance is concerned and handling probably too It certainly is a coupe with little room inside but the engine and chassis are far from being Sport car elements The base Mustang model comes with a lot of features all power alloy wheels rear defrost remote entry CD player Big mistake form This car needs a smaller and more efficient engine with at least 30 more horse powers and lighter material to lose about 500 lbs This car chassis is 10 or 15 year old suspensions are more comfort than sport and the weight also alters the handling The plastics used inside are not not_bad not_at not_all not_for not_a not_cheap not_car and it is assembled pretty well No noises in the car even after 36 k miles With a too big and heavy 3 8l engine they only get 155 HP which is ridiculous above all considering the very heavy weight of the car Too heavy to be a real sport car The camaro V6 has a lot more horse power The Golf GTI is quicker The Mitsubichi Eclipse is quicker and more economical handles better A great buy Inside the car is pretty nice and well organized Might also need a 6 speed instead of a 5 I definitely recommend choosing a stick if you want some kind of sensation so that you can go up in the RPMs and get a little power The car max speed is alo limited electronically and usually varies between 115 and 120 Mine never went above 115mph but considering how dangerous highways are and how many cops are out there it is more tha enough My husband bought a V8 after we sold the V6 and he loved the sensations I guess the Mustang v6 is a good car for a young driver as it is cheap and is not not_too not_quick not_I not_would not_not not_recommend not_it not_otherwise At red lights I could not not_even not_try not_to not_compete not_with not_most not_sedans not_like not_the not_ACCORD not_v6 not_MAzda not_V6 not_some not_pick not_ups not_For not_Sport not_if not_you not_have not_to not_own not_a not_MUSTANG not_GET not_THE not_AMZINGLY not_POWERFUL not_V8 not_but not_then not_be not_careful not_because not_the not_chassis not_suspensions not_will not_not not_tolerate not_driving not_mistakes The price is low and the car looks good it has a lot of standard features for the price including CD player However it DOES NOT DELIVER as a sport car Just buy it for the looks or if you HAVE to own a Mustang Overall it is a good ride but not not_a not_sporty not_one How cheap A few positive things about my 98 Mustang IT is economical never had to fix anything well the CD player went dead but the warranty took care of that Gas mileage is great for a big V6 Basically an oil change every 4 or 5 k miles it seems reliable Except for that CD player no visit to the mechanic Quality improved It is comfortable for a sport car unless you are above 6 2 Then leg room is an issue in the front seats IN the back forget about the seats you could barely fit a 14 year old Might as well be no seats and more leg room in the front like in a MR2 My friend who is 6 5 actually fits comfortably in his MR2 Access to the rear seats is not not_easy not_either I decide to get myself a new car After driving heavy SUVs or Sedan I thought I could switch to a smaller more maneuverable more economical and quicker car Well after little shopping around big mistake I bought a Ford Mustang because they gave me a great deal and more money than anybody else for my old 4WD I first thought it was the best car because I had been used to drive older cars
Neg,No family in that car The quality is better than i expected and it is loaded What a value cant not_beat not_the not_price not_for not_a not_car not_equipped not_with not_CD not_player not_power not_doors mirrors remote entry rear defrost etc The ride is acceptable at low speed but becomes unsafe when taking curves a little fast or driving on a rainy day This car rear end wants to get ahead of the front end So get used to it before playing the race car driver If you want the sport look at a low price without the power it might be the car for you if you are single How embarrassing The Camaro six cylinder does better wit a more powerful engine I love the shape of the Mustang even though it is too high and massive for a sport car Or they would only need a 2 0l to 2 4l to deliver 155 hp on a car 40 lighter A sport car should not not_be not_that not_heavy not_the not_weight not_affects not_the not_handling not_and not_decrease not_pick not_up not_I not_had not_small not_pick not_ups not_totally not_blew not_me not_away not_at not_red not_lights How can you call that a sport car 155 horse power that do not not_deliver not_in not_spite not_of not_a not_pretty not_big not_engine not_3 not_8liter not_A not_European not_or not_Japanese not_car not_equipped not_with not_such not_a not_big not_engine would deliver twice that power and be a lot more efficient This significantly affects the leg room which would otherwise be decent for this type of car Next disappointent was the engine or more exactly its lack of power for such an heavy car which brings me to the next flaw of this SO CALLED sport car it weight However I think all cars should come with floor mats it is ridiculous to make them an option Another plus for this compact 2 door not not_so sporty car is the size of the trunk HOWEVER the opening is tiny so dont not_even not_think not_about not_loading not_any not_big not_items Three years ago I finally could offer my own brand new car Coming from France I wanted something I could not not_find not_there not_something not_typically not_American not_I not_looked not_at not_the not_new not_Sebring and found it a little expensive and very heavy I was not not_that not_impressed plus it looked like a car designed for older people My legs would start hurting after a couple of hours of driving due to the lack of leg room and the uncomfortable seats which were also too short too support the top part of my legs A tall person would also find the passenger side uncomfortable because of the seat itself and the lack of knee room the dashboard above the glove compartment is extended toward the passenger to an extreme So I thought I would go for the Myth The So worldwide famous Ford Mustang I Was so excited by the purchase experience and the fact I was going to own a brand new car that I did not not_realize not_how not_bad not_this not_car not_was not_for not_me not_After not_a not_few not_months not_of not_driving not_the not_excitement not_of not_driving not_a not_new not_Mustang not_was not_gone and reality struck The Ford Mustang cannot not_seat not_four not_people not_so not_why not_bother not_with not_the not_rear not_seats not_Unless not_you not_put not_kids not_in not_the not_back not_kids not_up not_to not_11 not_or not_12 not_top not_my not_11 not_YEAR not_old not_a not_little not_tall not_for not_her not_age not_was not_not not_even not_comfortable not_in not_the not_rear not_seat not_Well not_the not_truth not_is not_the not_Mustang not_can not_barely not_seat not_two not_if not_the not_front not_occupants not_are not_big not_or not_just not_tall not_I not_am not_6 not_2 not_and not_over not_200 not_lbs not_I not_drove not_I not_sold not_that not_car not_after not_2 not_years not_even not_though not_it not_was not_paid not_off not_with not_the not_steering not_wheel not_sitting not_on not_my not_lap not_my not_left not_knee not_stuck not_between not_the not_turning not_signal not_and not_the not_door
Neg,It seems they might not not_be not_rumors not_after not_all It seems that I spend much more time at the dealership than I should especially with such a new car The problems started with a horrible clicking noise in my left front tire and seems to escalate to additional problems on a daily basis By the way they do find something every time I go I am not not_imagining not_things not_I not_have not_often not_heard not_rumors not_about not_Ford not_cars but chose to ignore them I bought a 1998 Mustang because I fell in love with the car the moment I stepped foot on the car lot I bought it the same day I took the test drive The car is beautiful and amazingly comfortable Although Ford has great servicing for these cars I am disappointed that within six months of owning the car I am having trouble with the engine squealing tires loose windows and creaks of every possible kind I take great care of my vehicle and do not not_abuse not_it not_in not_any not_way
Neg,This car is just flat beautiful The 3 8L V6 is smooth and responsive And yes the trunk is small but it IS a sports car not not_a not_sedan And this being said from a guy who drove BigBlocks in the 70s with ample power Then there is the obvious Its looks Bright Red on one of the best body styles of the 90s It looks mean just sitting there buy is sleek enough to slice through the air with outstanding aerodynamics The seats are comfortable yet offer enough support that even on our long trip we never felt fatigued ive owned 87 cars in my life some new some very old but this Mustang takes the cake Over 80 000 miles and NO repairs NO problems Plus we get 25 27 MPG around town and on a recent 1600 mile trip averaged 32 MPG on the road And that was as she purred along at 85 MPH for a good portion of the trip Sure the back seat isnt not_that not_big but it holds my 2 teenagers who would much rather be driving her with no problems though im sure they wouldnt not_want not_to not_take not_a not_long not_trip not_back not_there Heck I havent even had to change the brakes yet Whoops my wife just reminded me we had a turn signal bulb that went out Total repair costs in 80 000 miles 2 95 AMAZING My boss has the same year Camaro V6 and I can out run it out gas mileage it out handle it and I dont not_have not_to not_fix not_it not_once not_a not_month not_and not_all not_for not_only not_4000 not_LESS not_than not_he not_paid If you need more back seat or trunk room than what this car has then you shouldnt not_be not_driving not_a not_sports not_car not_I not_highly not_recommend not_this not_car not_to not_ANYONE not_looking not_for not_a not_car not_with not_some not_flare not_great not_fuel not_mileage not_Performance not_EXTREME not_RELIABILITY not_and not_less not_expensive not_than not_anything not_in not_its not_class not_MUSTANGS not_RULE She will sqaull the tires from a dead stop and when my wife isnt not_with not_me I just love blowing the doors off the Hondas Acuras Toyotas and what ever other piece of Jap Crap is cruising the local boulivard Even us grey hairs like to have some fun now and then
Neg,In this respect it has filled my paramount expectation Of course the first Mustang question is V6 or the GT Well coming from Europe 3 8L seemed like a huge engine and the extra cash for the GT a little unnecessary The interior has been forgiving of my carelessness with a little maintenance the upholstery and dash are in almost perfect shape Seats are not not_luxurious but none the less comfortable The car has a tendency to fish tail especially when building up from a complete stop I think the reviewed 1999 25th anniversary models compactness may take on board this concern Three years later and 40 000 on the clock I regret my decision to plump for the V6 Its not not_that not_3 not_8L not_V6 not_lacks not_pace not_it not_just not_does not_not not_compete not_at not_that not_sports not_car not_level not_I not_imagine not_4 not_6L not_makes not_all not_the not_difference not_in not_performance The front seat is electronically controlled while the passanger seat is a lever Outside this car is a looker bought in 1998 I still get complements on its sleek silver exterior Get the spoiler However I have become concerned about how my Mustang handles in the rain coming out of the car wash and on one occasion the Texas snow I bought my 1998 V6 Ford Mustang brand new at the end of 1998 Despite poor salesmanship the car seemed a good looker had reasonable pace and I had every reason to believe in Ford reliability so I bought it At around 17 000 I believed and still do I got a bargain First and foremost with 40 000 miles completed this car has never given me any maintenance headaches touch wood That salesman told me a lie about them changing the design Overall this is a solid reliable car I have maintained it well and therefore expect it to run at least another 40 000 miles I very rarely have more than two people in my car but on the occasion I do its less than comfortable in the back neither does the Mustang bless us with a lot of trunk space Bottom line this is no family car
Neg,No doubt this pony was beautiful to look at with its bright Atlantic blue paint and white top I am not not_a not_car not_expert but I know I waited many years before acquiring what I thought was my dream car In January 2000 I bought a 1998 Mustang convertible 6 cylinder automatic But in the department of performance the car was lacking Many Mustang fanatics told me I got what I paid for as they swear by the GT engine I was disappointed especially after driving three rental cars after the Mustang was rear ended and in the shop for repairs All three of the rentals were equipped with 6 cylinder engines and all out performed the Mustang 6 cylinder Rentals were a 99 Chrysler Sebring a 99 Dodge Intrepid and a 2000 Pontiac Grand Am I just expected more from the Mustang than Ford delivered I understand Ford has improved the performance of the 99 6 cylinder Mustangs but I am waiting delivery on a 2000 Mustang GT convertible Now I will sit back and let the Mustang fanatice criticize me for choosing an automatic 8 cylinder over the standard transmission
Neg,The seat back broke inside and it wont stay upright They look alike on the outside but the 1984 model has demonstable shortcomings Her car gets pretty good mileage has 15 wheels and has better acceleration It also has a bunch of crush space to absorb collision impact The 1984 has an igniton module that simply quits going down the road Also the car has 14 wheels which makes finding used tires large enough difficult The lack of road feel is a positive thing both in rural areas and over city potholes The seat has absolutely no lumbar support which is verified by driving moms 86 model which is not not_broken The fuel injector is a throttle body type in the 84 and a tuned port type in the 86 which is far superior in driveability and economy It also has the aggravating characteristic of testing out all right on the test bench but not not_working not_in not_the not_car not_The not_86 not_model not_has not_a not_different not_system The earlier car is a boat anchor that has occupied space in the yard for the weedeater to trim around while the 1986 model has soldiered on trouble free Unlike the fellow who reviewed an 84 Crown Vic by owning an 86 model I can give you the real story First the car has a good ride on dirt roads and a huge ten dead body sized trunk My experience is based upon getting to borrow my moms 1986 Crown Victoria which is a wonderful car except for the front bench seat and subsequently buying a 1984 Crown Victoria thinking that I would be getting the same critter Of course mine has no acceleration most of the time execept behind a tow truck Dont buy an 84 Get an 86 which is a fishing car beyond comparison if you want cheap transportation with room for your XXL buddies and all their gear My car was really cheap with no body damage and only 80 000 actual miles but it was no bargain because its ignition and fuel injection systems were badly designed I have only gotten a few miles out of it while mom has gotten another 50 000 with hers without a hitch
Neg,The pros although limited are as follows The rear sliding window is a nice addition and the air conditioning is excellent We recently put a service bed on it and replaced the entire ignition system The cab is huge and easily sits five people six if they like each other The 460 CI engine is full of torque and pulls trailers up relatively steep inclines 6 grade easily The company that I work at owns a 1991 Lariat that lives up to Fords Fix Or Repair Daily reputation The company is purchasing a new truck near in the future and I wont be the least bit surprised when it isnt not_a not_Ford The seats are the most uncomfortable ive ever sat in the contouring is all wrong and you sit way too far into the seats The tailgate had plastic elements that became heavily stressed and broke so the only way to open the tailgate was with two people and two screw drivers The headlight control between bright and dim is on the floor which is sometimes hard to find especially at night when it is most needed This is to be expected being a heavily used work truck but I believe we should be getting a bit more mileage out of each component since not not_many not_people drive the truck and it is usually babied This truck looks nice on the outside and the paint is in fairly good condition although off white was not not_a not_good not_choice not_Now not_for not_the not_cons not_this not_truck not_has not_300 not_000 not_miles not_on not_it and has had three engines and seven transmissions put into it As of now the seventh transmission is in bad shape and will probably have to be replaced in six months or less The exhaust mounting is hardly up to par and two have broken Manual hubs are ridiculous especially in a truck manufactured after 1990 Minor mechanical failures and electrical glitches have put this truck in the shop for much more than routine maintenance Gas mileage with the 460 is absurd averaging 10 13 the two gas tanks this truck sports are absolutely necessity and before going anywhere you have to make sure they are full
Neg,They only did the oil change that day When I picked it up I inquired about the air filter and the double clutching On my third complaint about it I got the nice fellow who works behind the counter to admit that based on his experience driving my car there was a problem getting it into reverse I wish Id gotten it in writing Yes its a manual transmission and double clutching is when you take the car which is not not_moving not_from not_whatever not_gear not_you not_were not_in not_into not_neutral not_lift not_the not_clutch not_depress not_the not_clutch not_again not_and not_then not_engage not_it not_into not_reverse not_I not_took not_it not_into not_the not_dealership not_I not_bought not_it not_from not_and not_asked not_them not_to not_look not_into not_it not_during not_some not_other not_routine not_maintenance not_oil not_and not_air not_filter not_change And dont get me started about how much its worth now I had a local Saturn dealership make a trade in offer on it and I was very sad and decided to keep the car a bit longer to get some value out of the depreciation I ll have to eat when I sell it Things I like about it handling gas economy sharp look if a bit cartoonish comfy seats trunk space even in the sedan model I got my 97 Escort brand new in 1997 I was in the market for something that would be easy to maintain get me around good distances comfortably and be a good first car I initially was looking at used cars but decided that a new car would be good since the warranty was a big bonus to me having little knowledge about cars and car maintenance Within 15 000 km I started having to double clutch to get into reverse about half the time They said they d have someone out to where my car was parked to show me how to use my transmission and install the air filter Well the assistant service manager I think that was his title came out He was very condescending until he had to admit that a he didnt not_know not_what not_type not_of not_air not_filter not_my not_car not_needed not_he not_didnt not_have not_the not_tools not_to not_remove not_the not_old not_one not_and not_c not_he not_didnt not_know not_how not_to not_properly not_install not_the not_new not_one This is really confidence inspiring After this amusing demonstration he proceeded to tell me that first is a magical gear im not not_making not_this not_up and that I always need to put it into first before trying to put it in reverse I explained that I usually have it in first because im usually going slowly before wanting to go in reverse but I acknowledged that I might not not_always not_do not_that not_I not_went not_away not_trying not_to not_be not_sure not_to not_always not_have not_it not_in not_first not_before not_putting not_it not_in not_reverse not_I not_found not_that not_without not_double not_clutching not_I not_often not_wouldnt not_be not_able not_to not_get not_it not_into not_reverse not_anyway not_I not_took not_the not_problem not_back not_to not_the not_dealership not_and not_same not_condescending not_attitude not_from not_another not_staff not_person not_who not_proceeded not_to not_tell not_me not_oh not_no not_its not_not not_first not_its not_second not_that not_is not_the not_magical not_gear He no longer works there and I havent been able to get it fixed Among the other admitedly minor problems and or complaints ive had with the car include no interior trunk release I have to get out of the car with the key to unlock the trunk after many service attempts my car is still often hard to start when cold im sure my starter will have a shorter life because of the amount of time I have to engage it to get the engine to start And I dont not_live not_in not_a not_cold not_climate not_interior not_dome not_light not_only not_works not_intermittently not_Upon not_complaining not_about not_it not_they not_reluctantly not_replaced not_the not_light not_bulb not_in not_it not_though not_Id not_repeatedly not_explained not_it not_wasnt not_the not_bulb not_because not_it not_was not_intermittent not_Overall not_I not_do not_have not_to not_say not_that not_I not_really not_like not_the not_little not_car not_and not_I not_like not_the not_refinements not_Ford not_has not_made not_to not_the not_Focus not_which not_really not_improve not_on not_the not_Escort not_However not_after not_my not_service not_experience not_there not_isnt not_a not_snowballs not_chance not_in not_Hades not_that not_I not_ll not_ever not_buy not_another
Neg,My biggest beef was the low clearance of the vehicle Tree branches were snagged by the frame on two separate occasions The auto 4WD function was a nice feature that operated flawlessly during the wet season That was the only thing I like about the Explorer for off road use The duel open action of the back window and tailgate was a nice convience since you could just open the window to retrieve objects Who should buy Anyone who wants the status of an SUV and does not not_plan not_any not_off not_road not_excursions not_except not_for not_maintained not_gravel not_roads One note the Explorer probably would have done better with real mud tires I loved the vehicle for its on road use but hated its overall off road use I drove a company 96 Explorer XLT for six months which was used on and off road The Explorer is a comfortable ride and has ample cargo space as compared to my 88 Jeep Cherokee and other small SUVs Who shouldnt not_Anyone not_that not_needs not_a not_good not_4WD not_vehicle not_for not_heavy not_off not_road not_use not_Because not_of not_the not_lackluster not_4WD not_experience not_and not_low not_clearance not_of not_the not_96 not_Explorer not_XLT not_I upgraded my 88 Cherokee to a 96 Isuzu Trooper which is also reviewed by me separately With the hinges of the tailgate on top the tailgate would act as a shelter during rain events where note pad could be kept dry I was very pleased with the on road handling of the Explorer but was disappointed with its off road use With the back seats down the vehicle was able to hold all of my field gear while conducting drilling activities on a hazardous waste site Believe me when you work on haz sites there is a lot of gear to be toted around On one occasion a stick interfered with the gears of the vehicle I could not not_get not_the not_truck not_out not_of not_gear not_until not_someone not_crawled not_beneath not_the not_vehicle not_and not_pulled not_the not_stick not_out not_Try not_that not_repair not_alone not_on not_an not_off not_road not_trail not_Another not_time not_the not_vehicle not_slipped not_into not_the not_tire not_ruts not_from not_heavy not_equipment not_and not_bottomed not_out not_I not_was not_able not_to not_get not_out not_by not_immediately not_gunning not_the not_engine not_I not_was not_surprised not_that not_the not_vehicle not_came not_out not_of not_that not_situation not_considering not_the not_lackluster not_of not_past not_4 not_wheeling not_Several not_times not_the not_Explorer not_could not_not not_pull not_itself not_out not_of not_a not_muddy not_area not_without not_a not_running not_go not_These not_were not_similar not_areas not_that not_my not_88 not_Cherokee not_handled not_with not_ease
Neg,It has room for five people if you and your friends dont not_have not_legs First it is a very flimsy car and a collision with anything larger would mean my death The Ford Explorer is not not_the not_biggest not_SUV but it is too big for me I cannot not_stand not_driving not_in not_it not_for not_many not_reasons Also it has horrible suspension which makes listening to cds impossible because of all the skipping and every ride is very uncomfortable The gas mileage although good compared to an expedition or excursion is much worse than I would hope for It is about 13 miles per gallon city 18 miles per gallon highway With the gas prices as high as they are having a car which guzzles this amount of gas is killing my wallet Finally despite the atrocious size of this behemoth and the trouble I have in finding a parking place for it it is still impossible to fit into
Neg,The vehicle drives like a 10 year old truck ready to stop any minute The above repairs are in addition to the normal maintenance done on the vehicle like 1 replace battery 2 replace all 4 tires and align wheels 3 replace front and back brake pads and turn rotor I purchased the Ford Explorer for its styling space and published reports about the excellent performance I love the safety aspects of the vehicle and I hate the current performance of the vehicle just crossed 50 000 miles The vehicle performed satisfactorily till about 48 000 miles when problems started 1 had to replace the engine thermostat main gasket and water pump 2 had to replace the exhaust sensor 3 the transmission appears to be slipping although the dealer says it is OK and it is giving 14 miles per gallon
Neg,The interior has remained solid free of cracks and fading amazing in the 110 degree summer heat of my area It has not not_given not_me not_any not_engine not_troubles and the brakes and normal wear and tear items have been uneventful My second Explorer a 2WD 1996 has been a different experience than my first a 1993 model I have 35714 miles on it and it is on its 3rd automatic transmission The paint still looks new my color was called Mocha but looks Gold and the black trim cleans up well I would warn that dealing with Ford on repair issues can be painful at best and to document EVERYTHING with the service department This time around I am out of warranty and out of luck and after pleading my case with Ford I was told they will offer no comment or assistance Outside of several thousand dollars in repair expenses on a 3 year old vehicle on its 3rd transmission the car has performed satisfactory They have reduced the cup holder size and removed the slot for coffee cup handles so that if you are drinking anything other than a fast food small drink it will be on your lap due to lack of room Handling is O K however as will as Explorers I have driven or owned the rear wheels slide in wet conditions when making a corner even at slow speeds
Neg,I drove a Ford Explorer for three years and I liked it until I realized what I was missing Because it was my first car I had nothing to compare it to but after having driven other cars I realize that the Explorer is not not_that not_great not_Its not_suspension not_and not_handling not_are not_really not_awful not_compared not_to not_other not_cars not_in not_its not_class not_and not_it not_cost not_me not_a not_ridiculous not_amount not_of not_money not_for not_gas not_and not_all not_too not_frequent not_repairs not_I not_was not_comfortable not_inside not_it but that was probably because I shelled out about 8 000 above the starting price for extras Although SUVs are traditionally intended more for off roading and that type of thing I assume most people buying one right now would be interested in driving it everyday as I did which is not not_something not_I not_recommend
Neg,Other new features The Ford Company This vehicle has an automatic door shut feature They were sitting in the vehicle and I was outside Their parts cost more than you can get at an independent dealer FYI What types of people usually use minivans like this Families Mothers with children As well as having a not not_so not_great vehicle here and there the Ford company also has its downfalls They dont not_honor not_warranty not_if not_you not_are not_at not_or not_even not_near not_the not_ending not_term not_or not_mileage not_limit There are only two little motion sensors b i Let me ask you this i The side door was open My Fiances foot was hanging out the door I lifted the handle The employees are charge fifteen percent MORE if they want to get something before their pay day i i He works at a Ford Dealership and often gets to see the features of new vehicles before they are released to the public The door started to close and wouldnt not_stop not_I not_yelled not_at not_him not_to not_move not_his not_foot not_Luckily not_he not_did In general I dont not_feel not_that not_Ford not_Windstar not_2001 not_is not_a not_very not_safe not_vehicle not_but not_thats not_just not_my not_Epinion not_i not_Thumbs not_down not_or not_off not_to not_Windstar There is a low tire pressure warning system that lets you know when your tires are low 3 8 Litre V6 engine Power windows locks brakes Child safety door locks Apparently the automatic closing sliding door feature is in earlier Windstars as well but im sure we would have heard about more injuries if they were made so improperly i The Windstar 2001 I went to visit my fiance at work yesterday If a mom were to turn her back and the door starts to close a kind near the door could be hurt very badly Since the closing is virtually sound less the only sounds would be the kid screaming over a lost finger The one good feature I saw is that the 2001 Windstars come with TVs and VCRs im not not_a not_car not_person and I dont not_know not_whether not_the not_earlier not_versions not_have not_TVs not_or not_not not_Him not_and not_his not_co not_worker not_had not_a not_Sony not_Playstation not_hooked not_up not_and not_were not_playing not_games not_while not_in not_the not_comfort not_of not_a not_heated not_minivan not_i not_The not_Downside not_i The door shut and sealed itself quietly i I couldnt believe this He assured me there were sensors to stop the door but when he was trying to show me he had to wave his hands all over the place and even still it hardly ever stopped closing the door
Neg,It is ridiculous The sliding doors always work smoothly It had a smooth ride convenient features and easy handling The Windstar has a very smooth ride and nice handling The seats are comfortable and the drivers seat has great adjustments The interior is generally roomy and cupholders are everywhere SAFETY All five of the rear seating positions are equipped with tether anchors All the doors automatically lock when the vehicle is put in drive The van is equipped with flashers on the side mirrors and cornering lamps In a nutshell I will be glad when Saturn puts out a van The keyless entry system comes in handy when you are juggling groceries and a toddler I first drove the 2001 Windstar as a rental in Orlando this January I was quite impressed The first time my husband removed the rear seat he discovered that there was a missing knob We settled on a very nicely equipped model and found one for 600 under invoice and 3 9 financing When we tried to install the cargo net we found that one of the knobs was broken There is even a sensor that is supposed to let you know if the tire inflation is incorrect CONVENIENCE You can usually put just about whoever and whatever you need to into this van Bad Things PROBLEMS FROM THE VERY START When the rear seat is removed the back will accommodate a full sheet of plywood a real plus when you have to prepare for a hurricane The steering wheel makes a strange clicking noise when you turn it All sorts of unexplained sounds have come and gone in the short time we have owned this vehicle It is very easy to drive and comfortable to ride in It is so easy to get into that even my two and a half year old son can climb in by himself So we went to pick it up Things went relatively smoothly at the dealership since the deal was already worked out However I was still there for over five hours Anyway about the van Good Things COMFORT The flashers on the side mirrors also flash whenever one of the sliding doors is open warning others that a child may be about to dart in or out of the vehicle Windstar has dual airbags and very good crash ratings This has yet to be resolved A few weeks ago the battery was COMPLETELY dead for no apparent reason Upon recharging it has been working fine Right now there is already some sort of front end problem So when my husband switched to a job with a car allowance the next month my vote was in I did lots of internet research to find out what model we wanted what the price ranges were etc When he took the van to the dealership nearly 60 miles away they did not not_have not_all not_of not_the not_necessary not_parts not_to not_fix not_it not_He not_did not_not not_want not_to not_make not_another not_trip not_out not_to not_the not_dealership not_for not_something not_they not_had not_already not_had not_two not_opportunities not_to not_get not_right not_so not_they not_said not_they not_would not_mail not_the not_part not_to not_us not_when not_it not_came not_in not_We not_got not_the not_part not_alright not_the not_WRONG not_one
Neg,It does not not_have not_dimming not_mirrors not_or not_lighted not_vanities The seats are very limited in power choices too You do need a 2nd vehicle practical along with this thing At least it should have had Gas miles to empty Your finding this now on cars costing half as much This may be a big problem as the cars age and more electrical glitches develop The vanity mirrors are a sight to see they are so flimsy and cheap looking If it forgets to drop you have to really push it open The car does not not_have not_a not_memory not_system not_to not_set not_seats not_and not_other not_choices not_per not_drivers You seem to plan your passing in advance Top may be good but low end punch would be nicer So you try and put it in the seat beside you hoping a brad is not not_on not_the not_bottom not_to not_scratch not_the not_colored not_seats On the window dropping to allow door to open well dont not_open not_the not_door not_fast or it has not not_completed and shakes the glass On the motor im not not_a not_mechanic but it doesnt have that much get up and go It will go but not not_like not_the not_old not_push not_rod not_motors All the articles and reports of unsold 02 03 units just sitting on lots with Ford slashing prices and offering rebate to try and rid of these cars The cloth top has not not_closed not_properly not_since not_day not_one not_I not_did not_go not_by not_a not_dealership but the repair recommendation made you wonder if would be worst off The passengers just goes backwards and forward Would it have kill ford to put in a simple homelink system on the visor like the lincoln LS after all its the same car basically Does not not_make not_you not_feel not_good not_about not_spending not_this not_much not_on not_a not_car not_either not_Gosh not_04s not_coming and they still cant not_sell not_the not_02s not_Ford not_announced not_the not_cancellation not_of not_the not_car not_too not_after not_a not_year not_on not_the not_market No locking gas cap they had to work overtime to cheap out this car Another small item is the lack of clips to hold the floor mats in place they are just light material sliding all over the place The top is a major inconvenience off its laying in the corner of the garage waiting till can get some friends over to put it back on This seemed better than using that rickity looking cart Now for those wheels they do nothing for the appearance of that car looks like a hubcap set As for running errands you are limited the trunk is very shallow a bag of groceries or even a slightly large boxed item will not not_fit not_back not_there Well its been a while since got a thread reply from epinion so will post what its been like with this car in over a year I too am very disappointed in what the car has to offer feature wise verus the MSRP price paid over 40 KwTT L One of the biggest was the lack of a full drivers information center giving an account of the cars functions
Neg,Other than the name these cars have nothing in common The only version that sparked any interest was the 1950s T Birds The 2003 Thunderbird is more of the same except with a different look and a grossly inflated price Then we will have the Thunderbird the way it was meant to be originally A sports car again Chris And what lies underneath is the same Thunderbird I drive everyday which was less than half the price compared to the 2003 The fact is the Thunderbird lost its Mojo after the 50s and became yet another family car with a puny engine Its hard to imagine that this car was EVER compared to Corvettes Ford has once again tried to bring back the Thunderbird But lets face it The car that has carried the Thunderbird name for half a century has really been about five or six distinctly different cars Who is going to pay 65 000 for a Lincoln with a T Bird name on it These days it seems that anything with a different look is popular regardless of what lies underneath It would be like Ferrari taking the Maranello adding room for four people popping in a 200hp engine and raising the price to a million dollars Anyone interested Didnt think so For the T Bird to be reborn Ford needs to drop a big time V8 engine in it with somewhere in the neighbourhood of 350 400 horsepower and 5 second 0 60 times And the 1950s were the last time a Thunderbird was ever a respected and exciting vehicle Its been a downward spiral ever since with the exception of the SuperCoupe from 1989 1995 arguably the fastest T birds ever made I own a 1989 Thunderbird and it happens to be a very ordinary passenger car with the exception of some luxury features not not_found not_on not_other not_vehicles
Neg,As the salesman told me All the fathers are buying these for their daughters So maybe the road noise is an outta sight outta mind kinda thing Good luck in your SUV searches To keep this short I had the vehicle all weekend and hardly drove it at all once I got home It is pretty basic and a little boring The V 6 Engine had more than enough power but they need to build something around it SUMMARY The vehicle has excellent pick up The Escape I borrowed had very few options basically a stripped model with floor mats and mud guards It just has the feel of a mini van I was very disappointed with the center console it is nothing more than a huge pit It is definitely one of the lower priced 4X4 vehicles but there are other options out there I would suggest looking to other makes and models The seats are comfortable but pretty boring they were just a plain tan color just average After a couple minutes I really felt as it I was in a Dodge Caravan of the late 80s The engine though peppy is extremely loud as well as the road noise of the vehicle I found myself talking much loader than normal to be able to communicate with my passenger Very disappointing with the road noise but speed and handling were very nice He was sure I would be back on Monday to make a purchase Well once I first got in the vehicle I did feel alot of comfort After checking out my surroundings I did notice that the head room was incredible but how much do you really need What you are about to read is what I got from a weekend rental of the 2003 Ford Escape I was kinda excited when I found out I would be able to drive one of these for a whole weekend in my search for an SUV Our local Ford Dealer had no problem letting me take the vehicle for the whole weekend The options it did have like power windows power door locks etc were all placed basically the same place as any other vehicle and they are all within comfortable reach of the driver Radio had some definite volume but you need to so you can hear music over the road noise Once I finally got on the highway and pulled out on the on ramp I was ready to take the car back to the dealer There is nothing there to really hold any Cds spare change whatever it may be It was basically a 2nd glove box Nothing spectacular Once I started the car up I could tell the power upon trying to put the vehicle in drive I notice that the gear selector is on the column Didnt we phase this out yet very outdated Once I left the lot I noticed right away that the engine had power but was pretty loud
Neg,We had just sold our Ford Aerostar minivan and we were looking for a smaller more economical family car What we ended up was a car that just cannot not_be not_repaired not_properly and is not not_very not_reliable The only reason I still have our Taurus because the value has dropped faster than my loan for it If I sold it today I would lose a few thousand bucks I purchased our Ford Taurus LX Wagon used with 19 K miles and we bought it because I was impressed by its long list of features and by the way it drove The Ford dealers no longer believe in test drives they just look for a problem and charge you even if they cannot not_find not_it not_I not_got not_charged not_75 not_00 not_to not_be not_told not_that not_I not_needed not_a not_new not_55 not_00 not_battery not_I not_also not_took not_the not_car not_in not_to not_have not_a not_rubber not_seal not_around not_the not_door not_replaced not_and not_they not_charged not_me not_30 not_00 not_just not_to not_tell not_me not_how not_much not_it not_would not_cost not_to not_replace We have had problems with the interior door panels cracking the dash bubbling the power window motors burning out turn signals that work when they want to a moon roof that has hardly ever worked inability to align the front end so we go through a pair of tires every 20 K miles I have only had it serviced by Ford and they have failed to repair most of our problems even after numerous attempts This is my 3rd and last Ford I had two Ford Explorers and Ford bought both of them back under the California Lemon Law I wanted to love this car I wanted to forget about my bad experiences with my two previous Explorers but this car is by far worst in every manner I have had it with Ford Quality is not not_Job not_1 not_Profit not_is not_Dont not_even not_get not_me not_started not_about not_the not_fact not_that not_Ford not_knew not_about not_the not_Firestone not_tire not_defects not_for not_years not_but not_still not_kept not_putting not_them not_on not_my not_Explorer not_and not_all not_others not_I not_was not_the not_lucky not_one not_who not_is not_still not_around not_to not_express not_my not_displeasure not_with not_Ford
Neg,No further damage was apparent This was repaired under warranty In 1996 my wife and I purchased our Ford Taurus GL wagon with an extended warranty The warranty was a GE Capital product that covered the car out to 100 000 miles As for the oil light I was told that this only comes on in extreme conditions The car was four quarts low on oil and I had not not_received not_so not_much not_as not_an not_oil not_light We had meticulously documented all maintenance on this vehicle and even in spite of our previous problems the vehicle repairs were not not_covered When the car had 78 000 miles on it my wife was driving and I was away on a business trip Her attention was directed to the fine print that stated that engine over heat regardless of the cause is not not_covered When my wife called the dealership where we purchased the car they instructed her to have it towed their On a trip my father noticed oil leaking from the car When I check the oil the dipstick came up clean no oil When we first bought the car we were really happy with it At the two and a half year point the problems started It was over 100 degrees and the engine seized up with no warning My wife and two young children were stranded for an hour before they got help They made her sign an agreement saying she would be responsible for the cost of any repair work that was no covered under warranty The reason this made me furious was that I was going to buy the Ford warranty but the sales staff told me that the GE product was better and cheaper To make matters worse I later discovered that if I had purchased a Ford extended warranty rather than the GE warranty the repairs would have been covered The gage light in the vehicle checks only pressure of the oil and not not_oil not_level I immediately took the car in for service A failed gasket was found at the base of the oil pan The service manager on duty informed me that if the oil light comes on the engine is probably to the point where serious damage is being done Well this ended up as the tip of the iceberg They also told her that this repair would almost certainly be covered under warranty but the claims adjuster would have to look at the car im sure you see the writing on the wall After several hundred dollars in labor and no real repairs my wife was told that the car was not not_covered not_under not_our not_warranty The final straw came when I made one of several calls to Ford Motor Corporation to complain I was told that the problems I experienced were due to normal wear and tear I will never again buy another Ford product I am only giving this vehicle 1 star because I can not not_give not_it not_less
Neg,Thats nice It sits five people How about a real world account How many times to the shop The stock rims look pretty nice but with one minor deficiency This is the Princess of Fix or Repair Daily Who would I recommend this truck for My worst enemy What could anyone be thinking to buy this truck It offers a full size spare but what pick up doesnt If thats not not_bad not_enough not_then the airbag deployed and slammed her back The airbags did not not_deploy not_until not_she not_had not_successfully not_smashed not_her not_nose not_on not_the not_steering not_wheel My other friend is a well mannered girl that is very gentle with her truck Overall She wont be missed but wont be forgotten May others learn from her mistakes The model of which I speak is a 1999 little over 15 000 miles on the clock What I left out in the original sentence is that it sits two people comfortably It turns out my friend didnt not_get not_the not_warranty not_I not_thought not_she not_did The Tonneau cover that this truck came with is a nice addition but even it has its cons So for the Chevy you ll pay less get better gas mileage and be able to keep up with Ford V6s This has been happening to lots of these trucks according to the dealer Transmission problems are normal right You want pros to this car Ok I ll try but its not not_going not_to not_be not_easy It refused to start on numerous occasions it was running extremely rough and the recalls were just too much As my good friend Foxspy said its not not_a not_truck Its a compact car with an oversize trunk Pro s you say Its outfitted with a towing package but if you can find something it ll tow let me know They traded this POS in on a 2000 F 150 4 6 Liter V8 with 5 000 miles on it Will they ever learn Thats not not_even not_the not_weight not_of not_the not_average not_male not_With not_the not_rear not_end not_sag not_I not_was not_expecting not_to not_see not_at not_least not_seven not_bags After that it had automatic windshield wipers but not not_as not_fancy as the Cadillac Rainsense wipers these wipers would just come on for no particular reason Too many lets see its already had to have a recall done on the cruise control IT WOULDnt SHUT OFF No more thought given I was on my motorcycle and asked her if she could take my backpack home she agreed Thats enough for pros im worn out with all of this thinking im going to something that comes a little easier CONS My friend whom ive recently fallen out of friendship with had a number of problems with her 1999 XLT Ford Ranger SuperCab 2 3 Liter Inline Four Cylinder Automatic Now you may say this is ok I might too if it was a Vortec 4300 with power but it is gutless Me and a friend asked her why her rear end was so close to the ground she replied that she had some cement in the back This truck does have better payload than a motorcycle I opened the trunk I mean Tonneau cover only to discover two bags of 85 lb cement The 4 0 liter version of this truck whom another friend owns is just as fast as the Chevys 10 But guess what size engine the Chevy has in it 2 2 Liter Vortec You couldnt tow a jetski in this thing with all of the hills on the way to Lake Powell or into Phoenix for Lake Pleasant Updated 4 25 Rear spring weight is useless Not to mention my friend had to replace his engine at 107 000 miles Rest in Peace Update 7 7 00 Well it is under unfortunate circumstances that I write this update Not three months after you buy a brand new truck Its been in the shop for other reasons but they fail my memory right now Not a reliable truck er car Updated 8 9 So the Ranger got good crash test ratings Id expect to get at least 40 highway my friend swore she got thirty miles per gallon which her particular truck did but any other owner of a 2 5 liter I4 will report never even touching 20mpg The red paint is really nice as said before Ford really knows how to do paint they might as well be able to do something right Four doors is awesome it has the two butterfly doors making loading easier but not not_easy Two more teens I know just purchased 1999s and 2000s which is something I will not not_stop not_ridiculing not_them not_for not_What not_a not_stupid not_choice not_Anyways not_one not_of not_them not_got not_a not_little not_out not_of not_control not_at not_highway not_speeds not_and not_ended not_up not_totalling not_the not_front not_end not_of not_the not_truck A total of 25 000 gentle miles were placed on this Ford Yet it was just too much she couldnt handle it She is survived by two sisters a 1993 3 0 Liter Ranger a 1996 Dodge Avenger a mother a 1989 AeroStar and has been replaced by a larger but probably as troublesome F 150 The Ranger was trouble from the day it was designed to the day it was traded in I feel guilty giving this truck one star since it doesnt even deserve that R I P i Little truck rest in peace i Born August 1999 Died July 2000 They come apart Another friend who owns an even crappier 1999 had a rim disintegrate at 45 mph he is lucky he missed all of the trees I dont not_even not_want not_to not_get not_started not_on not_his not_truck because he has abused it so much its hard to say whether the problems are his fault or Fords If you even consider purchasing this truck I will never read another of your articles or consider you a peer as you are obviously mentally challenged Loading Good luck the fold down rear seats fold down so you have to CLIMB OVER THEM Updated 8 9 Four bangers are notorious for good gas mileage right Not with the Ranger with this iddy bitty inline four cylinder She did get a pretty good deal on the truck walking out the door with a brand new semi furnished barely driven truck for 12 000 A better idea would have been a Ford Focus Although after reading some reviews or Chevy Metro since she d have the same amount of room better gas mileage better back seat generally everything would be better Alternative For those looking for a much better truck a Chevys 10 with either the 2 2 liter Vortec or 4 3 liter Vortec are recommended by me after lots of research Especially the 4 3 liter Vortec The Tonneau cover looks awesome on this truck it is very nice that Ford is implementing their trucks with such a cheap accessory to try to make up for more expensive problems Tonneau is actually a company that makes bed covers but recently all bed lids have been referred to as Tonneau Snug Top and quite a few other companies make similar products I believe the cover on my friends car is a Snug Top the weather stripping has already let go and it feels really flimsy to hold lift up on the handle Rear gate lifters that are standard in most SUVs for the rear window and or rear gate are all that holds this Tonneau cover up it seems that a much more effective way could have been implemented
Neg,UPDATE Last spring a new 5 spd was put in my truck No change I started going to a dealer in another town They took a look at the problem and immediately noticed play in the rear end Tear down the new tranny and replace synchronizers Quite possibly my old tranny wont have had this problem The brakes started grabbing pretty bad in the wet and the local dealer couldnt find the problem The truck is a dream to drive down the highway until I have to shift It kept getting worse and I kept bringing it to their attention everytime I took it in for service Well I decided not not_to not_keep not_it Had a flat and the spare tire lock was corroded into place so bad the dealer had to tear out the spare carrier and replace it under warranty By this time the problem was affecting the shifting and was noticeable to anyone outside the truck After doing the dance with the Fords Dispute Settlement Board it was agreed that I would get a new gearbox because after all the diff was OK They found severe wear and ended up replacing everything but the ring and pinion Still no change A month or so later I stopped by to let them know I was still having problems and that it was now binding up on 1 2 shifts Took it back to the dealer who said they checked it with their computer and it said 27 MPH Pure BS this truck never has and never will get anything above 22 With EFI I had expected it to better my carbureted 2L Mazda The service manager laid out a sheaf of TSBs which he said stated that it was normal for the clunk in the Ranger When I pointed out that all of the TSBs only related to 4X4s he couldnt come up with a justification Thinking it was the rear end I requested that they check it They did and declared it to be normal More on this later After getting the Ford District Rep to check my truck again normal I requested Arbitration I live in Illinois and thats the extent of their Lemon Law It still ran OK and got 22 23 MPH on the road but was getting pretty rusty and needed a new clutch I have had the fuel gauge sender replaced at about 2000 miles Ford has real problems with these accross all their vehicles from what I can tell problems with the heater doors the usual wiper switch problem etc The real clincher started to show up at about 5 000 I started to notice what felt like an abnormal amount of play in the drivetrain like a bike with a very loose chain accompanied by a noticeable clunk whenever I applied or released the clutch I brought it to the dealers attention and after playing like they didnt not_understand not_what not_I not_was not_referring not_to said it was normal What has surprised me is that Ford has had some of the same problems for years and doesnt do anything about them Right off the bat I started getting 16 MPH I knew that the engine wasnt not_broken not_in not_it was winter etc etc but 95 of my driving is on the highway I wouldnt not_have not_been not_surprised not_to not_get not_low not_20s not_as not_the not_EPA not_rating not_is not_22 not_27 The following opinion is as much a commentary on Ford as on my vehicle ive got a 99 Ranger Supercab XLT Sport 2 5L 5spd 4x2 which I purchased on 12 31 00 Its been into a couple of local dealers in an effort to get issues worked out I now have about 31 k on it and am debating with myself whether or not to take the hit and dump it I purchased the Ford as a replacement for my 87 Mazda B2000 Cab Plus which was getting a little tired after 12 years and 180 thou A couple of weeks ago I took the truck in for its 30 k service and to determine once and for all just what was going on The mechanic who had worked on the rear end previously test drove the truck and thought the problem was worse than ever He called Ford Engineering who basically told him that they werent going to do anything about my problem Period end of story Another mechanic there explained that this attitude was the reason he had a Japanese SUV he couldnt trust the American vehicles So here I am Do I keep it and continue replacing differentials at my own expense or dump it for another truck ive driven almost everything else out there and am even more disappointed The Sport package on my truck provides the 4x4 suspension which with the rack and pinion steering provides handling that literally nothing else on the market can match short of shelling out for a 4x4 that I dont not_need not_The not_4x2 not_Toyotas not_handle not_like not_drunken not_sailors not_by not_comparison not_even not_with not_the not_TRD not_package not_The not_Dual not_Media not_4 not_speaker not_stereo not_is not_the not_best not_ive not_heard not_in not_a not_truck not_and not_many not_cars The only reason I went to them was because the dealer I felt I could trust basically told me to take my truck somewhere else Didnt even want to do the 35 000 mile check Bottom line Read the fine print Fords bumper to bumper 36 000 mile warranty is only applicable to problems that they find convenient to fix or in fixing wont reveal a major costly screw up on their part Unfortunately there wasnt not_another not_truck not_around not_that not_met not_my not_expectations not_after not_having not_the not_Ranger not_Looked

Neg,The seats were very uncomfortable for such a long trip We recently had the chance to drive 2 of these trucks through Budget Rentals The horn can also blow if you are inside the building and press the horn button That was fun Great for scaring people because if you push it twice the horn blows We often lost power in it Also it would often kick out of overdrive by itself My mother says that hers does not not_do not_that but it could be a feature on this model The truck drove very well on the flat lands but when we got up in the mountains it had a hard time handling the inclines My son tried THAT one out All in all I would discourage anyone that wanted to carry alot of things in it ie use it as a truck or if you lived in the mountains The air conditioner worked great and I loved the cd player that it had in it I would have to say that the part that I liked best was the cute little buttons that came on the keychain so that you could lock the doors remotely My husband ended up having to sit on a pillow on the way back With the hard top bed cover it made it almost impossible to carry much or to carry anything very large I ran into problems with it twice Once I left the item to home and the second time I loaded what I could and went home and borrowed my mothers truck a couple of years older and a 6 cylinder to haul the rest of the things We decided to rent the trucks because of the deal they were having One of them had 3600 miles on it and the other one had 3200 I think having driven two that I can compare really helps my insight into them Both of these were the 4 cylinder Automatic Transmition with the Hard top bed cover Both were the extended cab I liked the amount of room in the cab when there are just 2 people and the adjustable shoulder straps were a great asset
Neg,The Optional Bigger engine with more horsepower as compared to the Imports standard engine is way below standards There are several spots where there was dirt under the paint and now the paint has come off OH I Just Love my Bright Red Super Cab Ranger with The AWESOME Sports Package But im finding that Fords Famous Saying Quality Is Job One is far from the truth I own an 1988 Ford Ranger with almost 200 000 miles on it thats much Superior to my 1999 Ranger im finding that theres many flaws in the paint The cheap look and Quality of the inside door panels and Door Pulls are very Disgusting A Few weeks after I bought this Truck the Door Pull and panel behind it started to peel I had this replaced and guess what The Second one is doing the same thing Yes I Do Love the Outside Looks of My Truck But I seriously Doubt that I ll ever buy another Ford Thats one reason why I just purchased a Subaru Car instead of a Ford Focus And I have bought Fords all my Life May I Ask Ford why the price keeps going up and the Quality Keeps Going Down Better Be Careful Ford Because the Love of Money may just end up hurting you in the Long Run It Just Cost You An 18 500 Sale with me
Neg,Yes I am not not_kidding not_After not_only not_9 not_000 not_miles and none in 4WD my dealer informed me the weird rattling noise I was experiencing required a new engine Six weeks for the new engine to arrive Two weeks in the shop with no loaner vehicle I picked up my brand new truck with its even newer engine to hear the noise again Another three weeks at the dealer without a loaner for me a Ford engineer examined the truck and the customer service rep examined the issues and my request to buy the truck back the problem was determined inherent Warning I have heard from reliable sources the service people and others on line this is not not_inherent not_Ford not_knows not_about not_the not_noise not_and not_is not_refusing not_at not_this not_time not_to not_buy not_the not_trucks not_experiencing not_the not_noise not_back not_specifically not_1999 not_3 not_0 not_V6 not_4WD not_Just not_thought not_you not_all not_should not_know
Neg,For all you folks who may own a 1994 F 150 have you ever had a flat tire The owners manual gives you 2 choices of jacking positions a primary and a secondary here is where the problem lies If you havnt you just may want to check your jack Yes it should be there but it will do you no good These will be my last all for the sake of a 20 00 jack SERVICE TO THE CUSTOMER a concept lost to the Ford Motor Company A word to the wise check this problem out before you too are stranded Your jack is too big for the primary point wont fit there and not not_tall not_enough not_to not_use not_the not_secondary not_wont not_lift not_the not_truck not_enough not_to not_put not_on not_the not_tire not_According not_to not_the not_service not_manager not_at not_the not_local not_Ford not_Dealer not_there not_was not_a not_notice not_on not_this not_four not_years not_ago not_but not_no not_fix not_I not_have not_been not_fighting not_for not_answers not_for not_three not_weeks not_now not_to not_no not_avail not_and not_no not_help not_from not_Ford not_Best not_advice not_the not_dealer not_could not_give not_me not_was not_buy not_an not_aftermarket not_jack not_not not_the not_answer not_I not_expected not_I not_currently not_own not_two not_Fords not_a not_Crown not_Vic not_and not_the not_Truck
Neg,The cab is roomy This time its the seat belts The truck almost steers itself The truck is beautiful and handles like a dream Id have nothing to put here That alone made me want to return my truck It runs well and gets decent gas mileage crud from Ford anymore I had in my head a great review for the 2000 Ford Ranger and then tires were recalled Then to top it all off I open up the newspaper and lo and behold ANOTHER RECALL This is something I strongly dislike about my Ford Ranger Honestly if it werent for these recalls You feel as if yo are just guiding the truck in the general direction and it is doing the rest itself They made the hood look more like a Dodge Ram I think this gives the truck the illusion that it is actually bigger than it is The handling is sweet We have the extended cab but I noticed they had actually widened the cab from the previous 92 Ranger that I had owned I love how powerful the engine is It accelerates so quickly and smoothly The 2000 Ford Ranger is a sporty truck with power I had previously owned a 92 Ford Ranger but with the 2000 model Ford had jazzed it up a bit Its an awesome truck for someone who wants to have the ability to haul with a pick up truck and the easy handling of a car What I like about my 2000 Ford Ranger This leaves me with the thought what next i I feel like im driving a time bomb ready to go off I will share my thoughts and feelings about the 2000 Ford Ranger recalls aside but I really needed to let you know how the recent recalls have affected my opinion on my vehicle I will never buy another Ford ever again It doesnt feel at all like a truck What I dislike about my Ford Ranger Well aside from the fact that my tire could blow at any minute and my seat belt might fail I really dont not_dislike not_my not_truck not_Major not_tongue not_in not_cheek not_here not_I not_do not_LOVE not_my not_truck not_I not_dont not_the not_problems not_ive not_had not_with not_the not_tires not_and not_now not_the not_seat not_belt not_so not_because not_of not_that not_it not_makes not_me not_wish not_I not_had not_not not_purchased not_this not_vehicle
Neg,It was apparently not not_an not_isolated not_case The corner cutting makes the truck not not_really not_desirable if you want any kind of workhorse You certainly would not not_want not_to not_torture not_anyone not_larger not_than not_a not_small not_child not_by not_putting not_them not_back not_there It looked like you could get at stuff under the hood and the suspension running gear even looked truck like The thing that really solidified my opinion of this truck was that one morning it simply failed to start On closer examination I decided that I really did not not_like not_the not_cab not_arrangement not_the not_addition not_of not_the not_little not_extra not_doors not_is not_questionable The bed cover seemed a nice touch but the latches were not not_reliable and you had to fiddle with them to get the lid locked down It turned out to be the security system according to the rental people when they arrived with a replacement for it and a flatbed to haul it off The Ranger appears to be another attempt by a major manufacturer build something that will appeal to people who want a truck but are economy minded That I am writing a review of this kind of truck is more or less an accident of fate I rented one for use on a project that required something with a little space for hauling electronic equipment around work sites It looked pretty good bright red shiny it even drove well Handling seemed adequate and the v6 engine delivered ok performance Crawling around the vehicle out of curiosity revealed that it seemed more maintainable that some of the more luxurious offerings in the truck classes by Ford And it did not not_take not_long not_to not_realize not_the not_disadvantage not_of not_the not_lid not_versus not_a not_cap not_if not_you not_fill not_the not_bed not_up not_with not_stuff not_that not_wants not_to not_get not_higher not_than not_the not_bed not_walls not_you not_cant not_close not_the not_lid not_Payload not_is not_thus not_limited not_severely not_Oh not_and not_it not_leaked There is no real body mass under the cab roof because of those doors and my impression was that rollover safety is reduced Behind the front seats there is so little space that all it would be useful for is to store stuff stuff like the flares and emergency road equipment that you might need
Neg,So I booked one Twice The first time they didnt not_have not_any not_so not_they not_gave not_me not_a not_Taurus not_see not_my not_review not_at not_a not_href not_auto not_review not_778A not_17C334B not_390A32D3 not_prod5 not_http not_www not_epinions not_com not_auto not_review not_778A not_17C334B not_390A32D3 not_prod5 not_a They are equipped with an auto retracting lap belt Child seats were completely unusable in this truck except in the front bench seat provided I could detach my right arm to make room for the middle mounted seat This was a surprise to me since I own a Toyota Xtra Cab pickup that is similar in size to the Ranger and in it the properly forward facing jump seats very safely accommodate both child seats in the back But to its credit it seems like such a cool truck otherwise that if I happen to be renting again at a time when I dont not_need not_to not_use not_child not_seats not_in not_it not_I not_ll not_give not_the not_Ford not_Ranger not_another not_shot Its a shame that I never had the chance to take it out on the open road drive with gusto and have it break down on me like just about all Fords ive ever driven have Did you read the Taurus review The second time they had several Rangers on the lot and I got a beautiful new white 4WD model I was really looking forward to enjoying this truck for a week Until I couldnt put my two childrens child safety seats in the truck The Ranger has two fold down diagonally oriented jump seats in the extended cab The Ford Ranger pickup with the extended cab is a great size it is nice looking and its probably a lot of fun to drive not not_that not_I not_would not_really not_know not_Heres not_my not_experience not_with not_one not_just not_last not_week not_Budget not_has not_a not_special not_on not_the not_Ford not_Ranger not_truck not_where not_you not_can not_rent not_one not_with not_a not_locking not_bed not_cover not_for not_20 not_a not_day The truck started easily ran well and was quite comfortable during my ride from the parking space at the rental car pick up area to the loading area where I couldnt put the kids seats in and back to the parking space a total of about 100 meters I had to trade the Ranger in for a Hyundai Now im no fan of Ford but Hyundais are just embarrassing I did get the seats in that though So I have to give the Ranger a poor rating due to its family un friendliness
Neg,It takes me a good long time to get to 60 mph How did I like my new transportation for the next couple of months This will be an easier and longer list to make 1 FLAWED SEATBELT WARNING SYSTEM In a foreign SUV even with more weight and power you can get better fuel economy 7 AIR CONDITIONING The EPA window sticker fuel economy rating for this is 16 21 and seems to be pretty close The above really just sums it up for the new Explorers positives now lets go on with the negatives Other than having a lot more space than my sports car it was an overall terrible experience POSITIVES It combines the more classic looks of the original Explorer with the more radically curvaceous looks of the model before this one Once you have driven for a while the unit gets extraordinarily cold though but its very temperamental 8 CHEAP TRIM Before we dive into the bad stuff lets start with the stuff that I like 1 EXTERIOR APPEARANCE It was a nice package 3 INTERIOR SPACE Immediately you notice this is MUCH larger than the previous Explorers When you look at this car from the outside it looks very grand beautiful and much nicer than the previous Explorer The stereo was terrible if you turn volume up at all it starts to crackle and mumble together It looks more like an SUV than a soccer mom vehicle or a glorified station wagon Its very nice looking on the outside 2 INTERIOR APPEARANCE It really did have a lot of space much more than I was accustomed to with the 1997 Explorer Good improvement NEGATIVES In this car you have to remove your hand from the perimeter of the wheel and push on the inside of the wheel Of course you may not not_have not_enough not_time not_or not_road not_to not_get not_going not_this not_fast not_since not_it not_is not_so not_slow not_5 not_OFF not_ROAD not_CAPABILITY You can expect below 20 mpg if not not_right at 20 mpg on the highway and closer to 15 mpg in the city during regular driving even with this small engine Previously having owned a 1997 V8 Explorer Limited I was anxious to get into a 2003 Explorer as my rental while my Supra was getting more than a months worth of repairs We ll just call it Good Game try again since this feature can be disabled and maybe they can correct it in the future or make a recall 2 SEATS The horn is not not_accessible not_with not_the not_thumbs not_in not_anyway not_while not_holding not_on not_to not_the not_steering not_wheel not_Other not_car not_manufacturers not_think not_of not_these not_little not_ergonomic not_issues not_while not_Ford not_apparently not_does not_not not_11 not_BRAKING Although it looks capable the 2WD version certainly is not not_I not_cant not_speak not_for not_the not_4WD not_or not_AWD not_versions but the 2WD V6 is anything but its just a jacked up roomy station wagon P 6 FUEL ECONOMY This may seem like a small thing but usually when someone is in need of using the horn they are in a high stress tension situation often reacting to an emergency The brakes fade very quickly and if they did this while I was not not_towing not_anything not_I not_can not_only not_imagine not_how not_dangerous not_and not_amplified not_this would be if I were towing a boat It takes a solid 5 to 10 seconds to increase the rate of forward rewind but spends too long doing so making this a very useless feature and much more useless than it otherwise could have been 10 HORN PLACEMENT This reminded me many times to put my seatbelt on Why is it flawed Lets say you wanted to quickly pull from your parking spot to your apartment complex mailbox and run in there for a second The outside trim is extraordinarily cheap Someone closed the rear door relatively hard and the trim started coming loose the rental car company said this was normal with their Explorer and noted it on the damage before I took the car 9 STEREO Also if you are a speed demon and should drive at high speeds once you hit the 107 mph speed limiter instead of limiting you gently at that speed it violently cuts fuel jerking the car dangerously slower in a sudden manner and very roughly In an attempt to encourage drivers to wear their seatbelt all the time Ford came up with a seemingly good system after you start driving if you do not not_have not_a not_seatbelt not_on not_you will hear a very loud and audible alert for about 10 to 15 seconds The engine is terrible I sometimes wonder if there is anything slower on the road I see a Ford Festiva or a Chevy Metro across the light and I am thinking There is no way that can be slower than this thing Ford did make an attempt to stay with the times and add some strange trim to it It looks like a silly silvery fake carbon fiber trim on the dash and doors but for some reason I like the way it mixed with my silver Explorer and the dark grey interior Not only can you pop up a third row of seats albeit not not_as not_roomy as the middle row but you can fold down everything in the back to carry large items I relocated a 30 gallon aquarium twin sized mattress and desk many rounds of friends stuff from apartments during college semester moving times etc It is the exact opposite of what you expect Maybe check this out next time you see one and you will know what I am talking about Its a switch you push or pull with no red indicator and its kind of a half button thing its terrible design 4 ENGINE This did succeed however in breaking my habit of listening to loud music since at loud volume levels it doesnt sound like music anymore in the Explorer Also when you forward or rewind it sounds like it is forwarding rewinding fast at first although it seems to be going at the exact same 1x play rate and just jumbling up the sound The cloth seats have a bad habit of bunching up and catching your clothes not not_to not_mention not_if not_you not_make not_a not_relatively not_sharp not_turn not_without not_any not_bucket not_like not_characteristics not_you not_will not_slide not_the

not_not not_within not_a not_few not_inches not_of not_your not_ear Makes conversation tough if not not_impossible not_this not_unit also takes a long time to cool down in Texas heat which may sound normal but it takes much longer than older cars I have driven You park you put your car in Park and you walk in while your girlfriend waits for you while the car is in park this seatbelt warning continues to beep and repeat every 20 or 30 seconds for about 10 to 15 seconds also if you put your seatbelt on immediately once you hear the sound you get to continue to hear the warning sign for the duration of its time Ford engineers should ve caused this to automatically disable when the car is in park and turn off when the seatbelt plugs in Their mistake Maybe it will be corrected in the future but it is not not_for not_the not_2003s The handling in this car is what I would expect out of an SUV although it feels less prone to roll over than the 1997 version of the car it certainly feels as if it is going to roll after each curve maybe this is because of the news attention Explorers have recently gotten about rollovers and me just psyching myself out but it is definately not

Neg,The ZTS sedan comes standard with the DOHC Ztec engine Cruising in this sedan is also quite good The interior of the 2002 Ford Focus SE is very edgy new wave The 4 speed fully automatic transmission plays a big role in this lackluster performance The front bucket eats are made of a cheap cloth but are surprisingly comfortable The exterior of the Ford Focus Sedan remains unchanged since its introduction in 2000 The suspension made this small sedan very nimble and relatively fun to drive on the twistys The Ford Focus has been a reliable car since its introduction and the Ztec has been a reliable engine since 1997 ack when the Ford Focus was introduced in late 1999 as a 2000 model it boasted many attributes that surpassed the competition The Focus however does boast plenty of rear headroom and the trunk is spacious enough for 1 weeks worth of groceries i Exterior Innovation i While once considered an eye catcher the Focus now blends in with a profusion of other look alike cars i e Suzuki Aerio These seats offer height adjustments and adequate support Room is average plenty of room up front but the rear 60 40 split folding seats will most likely offer a cramped

bumper to bumper warranty and an extended warranty at an extra cost Looking for a more refined economy car Check out my review on the a href content 74102312580 2003 Honda Civic a Happy Car Shopping The exterior like the interior is very edgy with long triangular headlamps in front and more pudgy triangular tail lamps Price Reliability Warranty i The 2002 Ford Focus SE Sedan with the comfort Ztec package comes to almost 16 000 Since this is the middle of the year Ford is offer some good APR rates The automatic transmission really hampers any sort of rush in power and when accelerating hard or even slightly hard the engine makes quite a bit of noise Since the Ford Focus SEs Ztec engine gets its peak torque at a relatively low RPM take offs are adequate but thats it nothing exciting just adequate At times I could have sworn I was driving a car with a 10 year old transmission clunking into gear and odd shifting patterns were common Handling in the 2002 Ford Focus SE Sedan was quite impressive as it was back in its introduction year The Focus SE remains composed at almost all times and is surprisingly controllable through hard turns While the interior of the Ford Focus is almost all plastic the plastic looks good and is much less plasticy looking many cars in this category Amenities are plentiful with the comfort Ztec package 600 Amenities include AC CC keyless entry power windows and locks tilt steering an Am Fm CD player that you will probably want to replace cup holders front air bags and more The 2 0 Ztec puts out a healthy 130 horsepower at 5 300 RPM and 135 lb ft of torque at 4 500 RPM 2 transmissions are offered this year a 5 speed manual and a 4 speed automatic which was equipped on my tester i Driving Impressions i Off the line acceleration is disappointing Having the 130 horsepower Ztec engine I was expecting close to the same performance of the old Escort ZX2 or the 2000 ZX3 5 speed which had the same engine It had bold styling a modern interior with plenty of amenities a good price and good fuel economy Fortunately for us the consumers and unfortunately for Ford Motor Company other cars such as the Toyota Matrix Suzuki Aerio followed in the Focuss footsteps and created an equally if not not_better automobile to compete For 2002 the Ford Focus Sedan comes in 3 trim lines the LX the SE and the ZTS While a 2 0 SOHC engine that produces 110

Neg,The wind shield affords a wide view You almost have to lift up on the gear stick It was quite a task to put the vehicle in reverse Ford thinks im not not_smart not_enough not_to not_know not_when not_to not_shift This car has a lot of truck space although its much longer than it is deep The car gets pretty good gas mileage at 25 34 MPG but I would expect more from such a small car The armrest is a stand alone console between the driver and passenger seats and has a good amount of storage space for CDs and other things I recently went out and test drove one of these puppies and here are a few random thoughts I had from this experience All the doors automatically lock once the car exceeds 5 MPH Very good vision when driving You cannot not_see not_the not_hood not_of not_the not_car The back seat has very little legroom and is a bit cramped Even if the front seat person moves the seat forward very little room is yielded There is a moderate amount of noise and you may have to turn up the radio just a bit when accelerating to higher speeds The clutch is very easy to push down on and transitioning from one gear to other is very smooth with the exception of reverse There are special child seat restraints and three seatbelts in the back Not exactly a huge family vehicle but equipped with child safety locks and other amenities Really good power for such a tiny little car Surprising in fact When loading the truck you really have to come forward into the trunk rather than placing objects down into it There is a hatch release lever inside that VERY useful if you are ever car jacked and forced into the trunk while the robber makes his getaway In the event of a head on collision the cars engine is designed to separate for the cars frame and drop to the ground I guess consumers dont not_take not_too not_highly not_to not_being not_crushed not_by not_the not_engine not_Its not_a not_snug not_fit not_There not_is not_very not_little not_space not_between not_the not_seat not_and not_the not_door It took about a minute and a half to figure this out the first time and about 30 45 seconds to do each time after that There is no RPM gauge Only this annoying light that comes on telling you when to shift up or down and usually at the slightest amount of acceleration I guess You step on the gas pedal and it moves Handles very good around corners Speaking of corners what is that loud clicking sound Oh Its just the turn signal I guess Ford wants to help eliminate those annoying motorists who drive 6 miles down the road before realizing their blinker has been on the whole time Since the turn signal is about as loud as a Mark McGwire home run swat I would say they are well on their way to accomplishing this goal The back seats also pull down in a 1 3 2 3 configuration for added capacity Overall this is not not_a not_bad not_car but at a price of about 17 grand it is WAY over priced I see this car as the exact duplicate of what the Escort used to be when it first came out If you are looking for a car that will get you to where you re going then this will do But the price tag is just offensive and was the main reason we did not not_buy

Neg,I bought a 98 Ford Escort sedan brand new It was a nice looking car and was affordable for me a divorced mother It was easy to steer inexpensive to maintain was good on gas and still looked nice Its the perfect car for anyone wanting a new comfortable car for a decent price Just watch the trunk They would only help me out of the still topsy turvy loan if I went into another Ford I did so but NOT an Escort again I am too afraid that I ll end up with another unrepairable leaky trunk That brings me to the biggest problem with Escorts Anyone knowledgeable about the auto market will tell you that they do not not_hold not_their not_value not_well not_they not_are not_a not_dime not_a not_dozen not_Driving not_my not_Escort not_never not_gave not_me not_too not_much not_trouble not_even not_in not_snow It had all the important options available had four doors and was easy to handle on the road I loved the Escorts appearance the sound system I had the Premium Sound option and the comfort of the seats I hated the leaky trunk I took that car in every few months to have the trunk fixed but still ended up with a moldy trunk moldy stroller and nowhere to put my groceries if I wanted them to stay dry After eighteen months of repairing the trunk without positive outcome I finally talked Ford into helping me into another car
Neg,No more then 1000 feet away from my house I go to hit the brakes and they lock up as my car goes sliding into a ditch This past winter I went out one day to go get some baby food for the new baby while my mom was still at work it was snowing out but I thought nothing of it at the time This was the first car I got when I turned 16 and I havent liked it one bit since then Sure its cheap and it gets good gas mileage but it is not not_comfortable and does not not_handle not_well not_under not_bad not_conditions The back seats in this car are very uncomfortable also I recently was going to take it on a trip to Niagra Falls about a 3 hour drive but decided against it because anyone in the backseat would be very uncomfortable the whole ride I wish I could trade it in and get a new car

Neg,Then a few months later a fan in the air conditioning unit broke and was also replaced under warranty So finally I saw a brand new 1998 Escort Sedan Sport on sale at the local Ford dealer for a little less than 15 K It was insane I definitely did not not_want not_to not_spend not_more not_than not_15 not_K not_for not_a not_point not_A not_to not_point not_car Also you cant not_upgrade not_the not_stereo not_on not_this not_car not_unless not_you not_buy not_an not_expensive not_adapter not_harness not_kit not_because not_the not_stereo not_is not_integrated not_into not_their not_heating not_cooling not_controls There is nothing Sport about this car 110 hp It felt more like 70 My old 90 hp 1985 Oldsmobile Firenza had more pep than this car I think the 2 door ZX2s have a better engine and has more pep but the sedan is very sluggish Who designed this thing All I have to say is that I was very happy when I graduated law school and sold this car I had it listed in the paper and auto trader for WEEKS before it sold for a couple thousand below blue book The car will basically be maxed out at about 60 mph without making horrible noises and shaking even though the speed limit in CA is 65 After about a year of owning this car the power window started sticking That had to be replaced but it was under warranty I bought the 1998 Ford Escort Sedan Sport when I moved out of state for law school Needing a mode of transportation I opted to buy an inexpensive car to use for the 3 years while I was away at school instead of driving my family car back and forth across the country each term At the time of my purchase the economy was still strong and not not_many not_car not_dealers in Southern California were willing to sell their cars at a discount price Mitsubishi wanted 16 K for their Mirage Toyota wanted 17 K for a Corolla Honda wanted 16 K for a Civic and even Chevrolet wanted 16 K for a Prism And being in warm temperatures if you turn on the air conditioning while the car is climbing uphill forget it Your car will actually decelerate even with your foot pressing the gas pedal all the way to the floor Also if you have 4 adults in the car forget about trying to accelerate at any good pace Anyway the first month of driving my car I thought that there was something wrong with the car In Southern California there is a LOT of highway driving even for short distances I was having problems accelerating onto the freeway it took me a good minute or two to go from 0 to 60 It was ridiculous I took the car in and they did a tune up on the car and could not not_find not_anything not_wrong not_Apparently not_the not_cars not_acceleration not_just not_sucks not_Period

Neg,My credit report shows a co singer It was in the shop within a week from when I purchased the vehicle There were problems with the clutch the transmission the brakes the radio and the cassette player The dealership that I bought the car from was 45 minutes away so I brought it to the one that was in my city I bought this vehicle when my last car died I probably should have spent more time researching the car and the dealership but I needed a car It was a 5 speed standard I had just thought that it was just a problem with the gears grinding but it turned out to be serious And on top of being charged extra I was told that I had to go through a particular finance company a whole new problem and since I didnt not_have not_a not_co not_signer not_i not_was not_charged not_a not_few not_thousand not_dollars not_extra So I contacted the FORD company itself and they werent any help either they wouldnt not_replace not_the not_car not_or not_offer not_me not_a not_discount not_or not_even not_an not_apology not_what not_I not_got not_was not_we not_have not_to not_try not_to not_fix not_the not_problem not_first My last car was a used one so I figured that this time I would go ahead and spend the extra money and buy a new one Worst mistake of my life I had picked the car up with only 3 miles on it from the dealership miles from my test drive So not not_only did I not not_get not_a not_good not_car not_for not_a not_good not_deal not_I not_cant not_even not_trade not_this not_one not_in not_until not_its not_payed not_off not_and not_worthless not_not not_that not_it not_really not_isnt not_right not_now not_I not_cant not_rate not_this not_car not_low not_enough not_I not_would not_not not_recommend not_this not_car not_to not_my not_worst not_enemy They charged me for looking at my car everything was still under warranty Money that I never saw back I was accused by the other dealership of not not_knowing not_how not_to not_drive not_a not_standard and intentually damaging my new vehicle NO one goes out and buys a brand new standard and not not_know not_how not_to not_drive not_one not_Needless not_to not_say not_I not_was not_considerably not_unhappy To this day the car still isnt not_right not_Last not_week not_my not_heater not_went not_out not_do not_to not_a not_hose not_coming not_undone not_second not_time not_its not_been not_fixed not_Something not_else not_I not_found not_annoying not_the not_bumper not_is not_plastic not_Back not_to not_my not_other not_gripes not_about not_the not_car not_I not_was not_way not_overcharged not_I not_was not_charged not_for not_things not_that not_I not_found not_out not_after not_were not_supposed not_to not_be not_standard not_on not_my not_car not_I not_was not_charged not_25 not_for not_a not_cigarette not_lighter not_and not_ashtray not_I not_dont not_smoke not_I not_was not_charged not_extra not_for not_the not_cassette not_player not_I not_was not_charged not_extra not_for not_the not_non not_keyless not_entry
Neg,The kids say its even noisier in the back It came with a no haggle price of 8 600 and a 12 month warranty But at that speed the gas mileage is only about 28 mpg and the car is NOISY And when I had to put a couple of grown men in the back last week I wasnt not_sure At that price the best I could do at Toyota was a three year old Corolla with 60 000K The car is pretty comfortable for me im a medium sized woman but my 6 4 husband doesnt like to drive it for more than 1 2 hour at a time When I bought it it was 2 years old and had 25 000 miles on it but I got it through the Ford Certified Pre Owned Vehicle web site I used to drive a fantastic little 1986 Chevy Nova A Toyota in a Chevy suit but it finally got too old and wobbly I went on line to research replacement cars I considered the Toyota Corolla Honda Civic and Ford Focus but ended up with the Ford ZX2 for a number of reasons My ZX2 is silver and pretty cool and sexy looking for such a cheap car I drive it back and forth to work every day and cram my two kids in the back at weekends I get to work much faster now the car wants me to drive above 80 mph at all times Id ever get them back out I think the trunk is generous and the cup holders are fine but the glove box is way too small once you put the owners manual in there you only have room for three cassettes and a Kleenex ive had the car for a year and once last year some kind of pin in the axle or wheel fell out I ground to a halt and had to get towed but they fixed it for free and thats the only problem ive had

Neg,IS THIS SUV FOR YOU Never drive one without a roll bar The large bearing has stouter brake drums and wheel bearings This car makes a better hobby than daily driver There are many after market parts available You get a lot of attention driving these cars They are prone to rolling over under extreme driving circumstances If you want power find one with a Ford 302 cubic inch engine The front and rear drive lines are interchangable in case one is damaged They are a very fun SUV and one of the first ever made Be aware that many people put sheet metal over the rusted area to cover it here They perform very well off road especially with the right modifications After market components are abundant The other main consideration is power steering and power brakes these options were primarily available on the 1973 1977 models They are fairly simple under the hood and are practical to fix off road and under poor conditions It can weave through narrow obstacles yet has a long enough wheel base that it isnt not_too not_squirelly not_on not_the not_road There is ample sheet metal and provide great protection in an accident but make sure a roll bar is installed WHAT ARE THE CONS The manual transmission equipped on Broncos was a 3 speed on the steering column and it often has inoptimal gearing for driving off road The older style Ford Bronco 1966 1977 is most suitable for someone who has a working knowledge about cars is prepared to do a little maintenance There are many after market adapters available for upgrading to a 4 speed manual transmission from an older Ford truck but his can again be pricey and a tedious conversion If you want to own the Bronco that everyone will envy and will be less costly to upgrade or restore in the future dont not_buy not_one not_without not_these not_options If you are looking to use it off road make sure to buy one with the Dana 44 in the front end and large bearing rear end all models came with a Ford 9 inch rear end However there is plenty of room and it is very simple under the hood so it is a good car to learn on if you are not not_confident not_with not_your not_automotive not_abilities not_Its not_a not_great not_attention not_getter not_on not_the not_street and performs very well off road However if you have a specific use you plan on using your Bronco for buy the one that will best suit your needs WHAT ARE THE PROS OF OWNING AN OLDER BRONCO Every other Bronco owner you meet will wave at you its almost like joining an elite club Not only is this a V 8 but the components allow for the bolt in addition of a Ford 351 Windsor motor if the 302 is not not_enough not_for not_you not_In not_summary not_the not_premium not_Bronco not_will not_have not_a not_no not_rust not_Dana not_44 not_large not_bearing not_12 not_inch not_brake not_drum not_vs not_10 not_inch not_power not_steering not_and not_power not_brakes not_automatic not_transmission not_and not_a not_302 not_cubic not_inch not_motor Many models came with a Dana 30 front end The Dana 30 has many drawbacks parts are hard to find its unique to Broncos it is more costly to upgrade to disk brakes and they are not not_as not_strong However the Dana 30 is sufficient for daily driving and occasional off road use They are expensive to maintain especially if you take them off road Even thought hey have a longer wheelbase than a jeep they still have a stiff ride on the highway Expect bump steer steering wheel will move when you hit a bump especially if you own one with no power steering and larger tires Body parts are scarce It depends on what you d like to use it for If you have any intention at all of fixing it up one day the most important thing you can look for is a rust free body Body panels are expensive and tough to find A good rule of thumb is to check the floorboards under drivers feet if they are rusted through move on to another vehicle It is nice because the hard top is removable but very heavy and can provide the open air feeling of a convertible Original equipment especially body panels can be a challenge to find for a decent price but there are many after market products available if you d like to modify it In my opinion the model fills the void between a jeep and full size SUV WHAT DO I LOOK FOR WHEN BUYING AN OLDER BRONCO There are many after market kits you can buy to upgrade to these options but these are pricey and can be tedious to install I see non power assisted Broncos as being better for off road use because there are fewer things that can break off road and leave you stranded However daily street driving is compromised without these luxuries especially if you install larger tires A Bronco with power steering and power brakes will bring a premium Finally you ll probably want a Bronco that has an automatic transmission even if you us it off road
Neg,If you were to replace all 4 ball joints on this vehicle be prepared to spend between 300 and 400 dollars In My opinion these parts should last at least 50 k maybe even 60 k if the vehicle is well maintained Exhaust repair will end up costing you about 200 00 due to rotting tail pipes and mufflers at least in this part of the country On the plus side of this vehicle is its handling and fuel economy and the comfort level is high I just dont not_like not_to not_repair not_suspension not_that not_soon and if you put off repairing the suspension remember your tires are next Over all with its decent fuel economy and roomyness it is an ok vehicle my personal Preferance is the chevys series in my experience these vehicles last longer Being a mechanic by nature my first reaction to this suv is to stay away from it and I will tell you why First and most importantly to me is what this vehicle holds in store for me or any consumer how much will it cost for repairs Large or small well i will tell you that if properly maintained you will get a long life out of these but when it comes time for suspension work or even exhaust work you can expect a large bill when the work is complete and the garage has had your suv for the whole day Suspension parts wear quickly on these for some reason weather or not not_you take care of them For instance the ball joints and tie rods are non greaseable and weather or not not_you not_go not_off not_road not_with not_this not_you not_will not_need not_to not_replace not_them not_Generally not_at not_about not_40 not_k not_miles
Neg,As the salesman told me All the fathers are buying these for their daughters So maybe the road noise is an outta sight outta mind kinda thing Good luck in your SUV searches What you are about to read is based on my recent test drive of the 2004 Ford Escape The seats are very comfortable but pretty boring in styling they were just a plain tan color just average More engine noise on city streets but once you get on the highway the road noise kind of drowns out the engine noise We went to our local Ford Dealer to see if anything had changed between the 2003 model and the 2004 Unfortunately very little changed There is nothing there to really hold any Cds spare change whatever it may be It was basically a 2nd glove box Once I finally got on the highway and pulled out on the on ramp I was ready to take the car back to the dealer It is excellent storage for whatever you may keep in there it is just not not_designed not_to not_hold not_anything not_imparticular It just has the feel of a mini van I was very disappointed with the center console it is nothing more than a huge pit It is definitely one of the lower priced 4X4 vehicles but there are other options out there I would suggest looking to other makes and models The seats are very easy to fold down and add extra cargo space once layed flat After a couple minutes sitting in the Escape I really felt as if I was in a Dodge Caravan of the late 80s The vehicle has excellent pick up Pulling out was very simple and the car like handling is a plus The Escape I drove had very few options basically a stripped model with floor mats and mud guards The options it did have like power windows power door locks etc were all placed basically the same place as any other vehicle and they are all within comfortable reach of the driver Radio had some definite volume but you need to so you can hear music over the road noise The engine though peppy is extremely loud as well as the road noise of the vehicle I found myself talking much louder than normal to be able to communicate with my passenger Very disappointing with the road noise but speed and handling were very nice More car like than most SUVs The 2004 Ford Escape is pretty basic and a little bit boring The V 6 Engine had more than enough power but they need to build something around it Car like handling is a plus but the interior needs to be more quiet Road noise isnt not_a not_big not_deal not_when not_you not_drive not_alone but once you have friends and family in the vehicle it can be down right annoying SUMMARY It is still a 4X4 Minivan in fact the only visible change we noticed is that the limited edition Escapes were a bit cheaper than the previous year Down about 1000 dollars depending on what options you choose Once I first got in the vehicle I did feel alot of comfort and room After checking out my surroundings I did notice that the head room was incredible the Front Head room is 40 4 in and the Rear head room is 39 2 in The dashboard is pretty basic and boring nothing really sticks out Once I started the car up I could tell the power of the engine 201 HP kinda roared once I starting it up Upon trying to put the vehicle in drive I noticed that the gear selector is on the column Didnt we phase this out yet very outdated Once I left the lot I noticed right away that the engine had zip but was noticeably louder than other vehicles
Neg,It makes it unable to close or open properly If any one has a suggestion please leave me a comment It is the only proof that you ever brought it back to there shop The top roller on the door pops out and the door is just hanging there If you know how to get out of a contract let me know I still owe 2 more years of payments on this vehicle I bought this vehicle for the room that it has Seats 7 with extra room in the back for anything else you need to carry What i learned and know hate about this vehicle is the sliding door I have had the door into ford a least a dozen times in the past year Now what do I do I have to carry a cresent wrench with sockets every where I go My warranty has expired Now and they have made sure that I have gone over the miles that they warrany there work Basically I got taken big I want to warn every owner Make sure you get paper work for all the work that is done Even if there shop fixed it at there expense It would seem to me that this should make the car unable to be drivable but as long as they fix it and it runs a month before it falls off again then its ok In the mean time it is a pain and a hassle I would think that they could bond it or make it fixed permantly but that does not not_seem not_to not_be not_the not_case not_Beware not_drivers not_who not_are not_thinking not_of not_buying not_a not_mini not_van not_with not_a not_slider not_Just had to take it to the shop march 8th 2000 the hinesville ford department and the body shop that they contracted have finally told me that there is nothing else they can do They have replaced everything on the door except for the door itself
Neg,Whats under the hood You look young for a grandfather The more contemporary model arrived in early 1991 as 1992 s To recharge five pounds of R 12 is utilized The 1991 model is the last of the old school Crown Victorias The air conditioning uses R 12 refrigerant which is no longer being manufactured It is still available at a current rate of 25 30 per pound That is why I installed a K amp N air filter in my car You do the math it isnt not_cheap not_Neither is the alternative As you can tell sometimes the urges are too strong to win the altercation The power windows use a nylon spool that breaks and tangles around the regulator and motor inside the door However I fixed it myself so I can give you additional information that others cannot The next section I will try to get all this technical information out of the way so we can get to the good stuff The local Ford dealer wanted 250 to fix my drivers side window so I fixed it myself with a part from an extra door see When Cars Attack section He said it was one thing and I found out it was another problem down the road I found out the complication the hard way You have seen the ones I am talking about they look like a mixologist put a 1991 Crown Victoria in a blender with a Taurus giving it a more rounded off appearance This is a highly crafted air filter that is reusable Just wash it oil it put it back in and enjoy the extra horsepower you now have Now if you meet someone at a cocktail party with a Crown Victoria you can magically predict that they have had problems with their windows Jiffy lube this buddy Vickey had greaseable upper control arm bushings This car was very fast advancing from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 10 seconds before the adjustments and 8 seconds after However the acceleration of this car is more noticeable at highway speeds where these adjustments had the most impact If this car was an actual human instead of zero to sixty she would be doing ten to twenty for attempted vehicular manslaughter Vickey i is the unoriginal informal name that my 1991 LTD LX earned Before I describe the attack here is the fun stuff To make things worse I had just replaced that door after getting broadsided with no injury to my passenger by a Grand am I put the original door on it after pounding it out and sold it at auction for 200 Good riddance It was a bone chilling morning 10 degrees in Vermont and I went out to start Vickey so she could warm up and I could get my things together inside the house I started the car got out and shut the door It is the same engine that is in a Ford Mustang and everybody knows that these are not not_slow not_Police not_require not_cars not_that not_can not_catch not_even not_the not_fastest not_of not_automobiles and this is why many police departments choose the Crown Victoria as their squad cars This was a hassle but creates less anxiety than handing a cop your licence and insurance information through the back window not not_to not_mention not_talking not_to not_customs not_when not_driving not_to not_Montreal not_do not_it not_through not_your not_back not_window and you are sure to be asked to pull to da side You can

my car would not not_start not_they not_sent not_a not_tow not_truck not_to not_tell not_me not_some not_misinformation This is a nice feature however it is really hard to find a service station that will do it for you The wheels must be turned to access the zerk fittings meaning two more steps for the people who service your car Make sure that someone does this at least ever two years at the absolute most or you will have an expensive repair Other problem spots The following sections are for people who are thinking about buying a 1991 Crown Victoria or a Mercury Grand Marquis and for people who have this large barge Knowing that for most people who are reading this neither apply I will try to keep it as brief as possible However I do have an abundance of information that I will try to shoehorn between now and the attack For the love of God if you have this car track all parts you buy for it It is a good idea to ask to see the used parts on any car before work starts on it even if you have no idea what the part is Use the force Luke Being from Vermont it is hard not not_to not_be not_a not_red not_neck not_when not_dealing not_with not_cars but it is a constant battle For every single mile I put on this car 80 000 I had problems with the EGR passages EGR stands for exhaust gas recirculation which sounds good on paper but means big problems for people who have to

the diamond metal fence it straightened out and proceeded to travel down my driveway Just imagine the next time you start your car what would happen if you turned your steering wheel all the way to the left shifted into reverse and let go of the break Now picture what would happen to someone if they happened to be standing to the right side of your car As I watched Vicky drive away sparking along the fence she slammed against the last metal pole on the fence and with a brief upward motion she rested at her final destination In retrospect this was a sound investment I also installed underdrive pulleys in my Crown Victoria which replaces the water pump and alternator pulleys with ones that underdrive several of the accessories freeing up engine horsepower I know you are thinking this is why I had to replace the alternator often three times however two of them happened before I made this adjustment so I ruled out this assumption After these two simple adjustments I realized I

I jumped to the side it slowed down enough for me to open the passenger side door I realized the wheels had been turned to the left making the car continue to come toward me After I opened the door my

Neg,It is also the last year for the 351 CUI engine The police package was the only Crown Vic in 1991 with a carburetor Not only was it a carburetor but an engineering nightmare known as a variable venturi The sticker price isnt not_even not_close not_to not_what not_it not_will not_cost not_in not_the not_end If you re looking for an inexpensive luxury car dont not_stop not_off not_at not_the not_local not_used not_police not_car not_salesman The acceleration was awesome but at less then 20 miles per gallon stepping on the gas was an expensive proposition When it was running the handling wasnt not_particularly not_good not_the not_breaking not_was not_poor not_and not_the not_ride not_was not_soft not_I not_cant not_even not_imagine not_what not_a not_standard not_Crown not_Vic not_would not_drive not_like The one I had was going bad The local Ford dealer wouldnt not_touch not_it not_saying not_that not_the not_best not_that not_they not_could not_do not_was not_replace not_it not_at not_a not_cost not_of not_1100 not_I not_did not_manage not_to not_find not_a not_mechanic not_who not_specialized not_in not_them not_and not_only not_charged not_500 not_to not_rebuild not_the not_one not_I not_had not_Eventually not_all not_of not_the not_major not_systems not_on not_the not_car not_were not_replaced not_one not_at not_a not_time not_just not_to not_keep not_the not_car not_operating This is essentially a re hash of the Crow Vic opinion that I wrote earlier I was driving a 1987 Honda CRX that was about to die and needed something quickly so I hit a dealer specializing in used police cars figuring Id get something inexpensive and interesting I picked up a 1991 police package formerly owned by the Connecticut state police Since the car was only going to be driven a few hundred miles a week price was the main concern When the car was running it was a lot of fun Good acceleration lots of luxury features that the Honda didnt not_have but it lacked cruise control so long drives were tiring and dangerous if there were too many radar traps Because of the size of the car and the engine it was easy to creep up to 85 MPH I did get interesting responses from other drivers and didnt not_have not_to not_wait not_behind not_someone not_to not_get not_out not_of not_the not_passing not_lane not_Unfortunately not_the not_bad not_outweighed not_the not_good
Neg,The ride was pretty smooth The transmission was not not_very not_nice not_either The interior however wasnt not_very not_roomy not_and not_comfortable The seats were rigid and not not_very not_comfortable It wasnt not_that not_great not_on not_acceleration not_with not_the not_manual not_gearbox It was a base model F 150 with a stick and base wheels and no rear bumper It cant not_put not_any not_power not_to not_the not_wheels not_when not_it not_needs not_it not_like not_in not_acceleration The Chevrolet and GMC seem to ride more smoothly and be able to take more heavy duty work Well on a road trip to St George Utah I rode in one for 5 hours on each trip there and back The suspension was really soft I dont not_think not_this not_one not_was not_made not_for not_towing not_or not_heavy not_duty not_work If you are going to buy a new F 150 then get the one with bucket seats automatic transmission stiff suspension and a towing package That way you will get some torque going to the wheels when you want it The bucket seats would make it a more enjoyable ride When you shift it and let the clutch out it jerks the truck no matter how smoothly you perform it It is also geared way too high As for speed it was fairly good at keeping its momentum on hills although it did lose some speed I think it would keep its speed better than most other cars with less than 200 horse power
Neg,But the overall quality was not not_good not_Under not_2 not_years not_old and the truck was rusting in many different spots This was not not_just not_mine not_doing not_it not_I not_talked not_to not_many not_other not_owners not_that not_had not_the not_same not_problems I owned the truck for almost 2 years then I sold it Mechanically the truck felt good allthought it lacked a little bit of power and was bad on gas I would go for the 5 4 next time I loved the truck it had a great ride for a large truck I had the off road package which gave it bigger tires and higher suspension Also the sheetmetal on the doors cracked and the paint chipped off this happened around the window frame and this is on every 1997 and up f 150 I also read they are having paint problems like they did in the early 90s paint on the top surfaces are letting go Not happy with the quality and was worried about the future of this truck Since I did not not_lease not_I not_financed not_I not_did not_not not_want not_to not_own not_a not_beat not_up not_old not_truck not_after not_2 not_years not_or not_so
Neg,The interior of the Taurus SHO is quite luxurious The latest SHO is much more manageable to drive than the original models It does this through a 4 speed fully automatic transmission Unfortunately A manual is not not_available U nlike Fords other V8 powered cars the SHO has its engine mounted transversely and driving the front wheels Throttle response is good and there is power all the way up to the 6 800 RPM red line The only problem here is that rattles seem to be abundant throughout the cabin over slight bumps or at high speeds The suspension set up provides a comfortable highway ride while keeping the car flat through fast turns letting you really enjoy this small V8 Although sadly to say much slower and nowhere near as fun Unfortunately the SHO is FWD RWD with an added traction control would have been a nice feature The comfortable interior is designed to compete with rivals from BMW and Audi Sorry Ford but the SHO does not not_compete not_in not_this not_category not_if not_you not_ask not_me The price is getting pretty low for these cars Nobody really wanted the SHO beings that the competiton offered much more value i e the Grand Prix GTP The plastics in the SHO are of marginal quality and the seating feels cheap and offers nowhere near as much support as the seats in the BMW 325 i The two electronically controlled shocks and multi link rear suspension give relatively good handling Despite being an all alloy engine the 3 4 is heavier than the previous before 96 3 0 and 3 2 220 horsepower engines i Interior Accommodation i The SHO does however have good ergonomics and tons of standard amenities power sunroof power door locks etc comes with an ice cold AC and power seats with lumbar support i Exterior Innovation i Some say this car is smooth and sleek I say the SHOs exterior design looks more like a big egg on wheels than anything else This design never grew on me in fact on the contrary I disliked it the more I saw it The only thing this car has going for in the looks department is the dual exhaust Ford has changed this design for the 2000 model year unfortunately the SHO trim line did not not_return not_making not_the not_regular not_200 not_horsepower not_3 not_0 not_Duratec not_V6 not_the not_top not_of not_the not_line not_power not_plant not_i not_Pricing i SHO is supposed to stand for super high output I personally wouldnt not_call not_235 not_HP not_from not_a not_3 not_4 not_liter not_DOHC not_V8 not_super not_high not_output but I guess Ford thinks thought it was worthy of the name Its 235 horsepower V8 and good road manners means that this Ford can almost hang in out right performance with the finest sedans from its European and Japanese rivals such as the BMW 325i and the Acura Legend i Driving Impressions i It can go 0 100 MPH in less than 22 seconds according to specs whoopi di woooo you might say but this is very fast for a family sedan costing less than 35 000 for the 98 model year L ike the SHOs first V6 engine the 3 4 liter all alloy 60 degree V8 is a collaboration between Ford and Yamaha Each concentrates on its own strengths so Ford builds the bottom end with balancer shaft to keep it smooth at high RPM which is then shipped to Japan for the 4 valve per cylinder Yamaha twin over head cam heads to be fitted Although torque peaks at 4 800 RPM 70 is available at an almost idle 1 200 RPM These cars are not not_that not_fast not_they not_have not_good not_but not_not not_spectacular not_interiors not_downright not_ugly not_exterior not_looks not_they not_get not_relatively not_poor not_gas not_mileage not_are not_not not_on not_the not_top not_of not_the not_list not_for not_reliable not_cars yet Ford has the audacity to stick a 31 000 dollar price tag on it I dont not_blame not_the not_public not_for not_not not_wanting not_to not_pay not_that not_price not_A not_1998 not_model however now can be found for around 14 000 or less typical Ford Taurus resale value i Conclusion i Because of the poor resale of the 98 Taurus SHO these cars are now an exceptional buy If you are looking for a cheap family sedan on the used market the Taurus SHO does offer good bang for the buck Other Cars To Consider i 1 Chevy Monte Carlo a href content 61018443396 http www epinions com content 61018443396 a MY Review 2 Chevy Lumina Z34 3 BMW 328i 4 Saab 9000 Aero 5 Dodge Stratus 6 Dodge Intreped 7 Ford Thunderbird V8 8 Mercury Cougar 9 Toyota Camry V6 10 Honda Accord V6 Coupe Happy Car shopping
Neg,The Verdict It aint That surprised me Preface In August 1998 It is quite weak The gas mileage was pretty good The wheel and controls were comfortable as well In that aspect the Taurus weaknesses become very apparent The oval inside door handles were very flimsy The oval radio console must make upgrading the stereo a nightmare It was a fairly quiet car too pretty solid and not not_a not_lot not_of not_wind not_noise The ovoid theme was carried WAY too far making this car look just as ridiculous inside as outside If you re used to well equipped fast cars you wont like this one So I always compared it to my car which was slowly coming back together in the shop Thats not not_what not_I not_reviewed not_Besides not_my not_GTP will make an SHO look like its standing still When I turned my head to look back over my left shoulder all I could see was the window post Thats probably why theres so little wind noise My Taurus accelerated like a small 4 cylinder despite the fact that it was a 6 cylinder This was a problem more than once merging on the highway Even worse in fact the worst problem I had with this car was the rear visibility The car was also easy to maneuver Not bad for a low end family sedan The Bad I didnt not_want not_a not_low not_end not_family not_sedan not_I not_wanted not_my not_240 not_hp not_loaded not_out not_road not_rocket not_back Three times I almost hit a car coming up on my left I never rely on mirrors I always turn my head to look over my shoulder before changing lanes The visibility was terrible and I advise anyone who has one of these cars to be extra careful when changing lanes Furthermore I just didnt not_care not_for not_the not_styling If you re looking for a comfortable family sedan for a fairly inexpensive price you might want to check it out Oh yeah and those of you who have Taurus SHOs and think they are fast well okay Maybe This rental car I had was a 1998 Ford Taurus The Taurus Since I had this car for 3 and a half months I feel kind of like I owned it Here is what I thought of it The Good What good can I say about this car Well for starters it was fairly comfortable at least in the 60 40 drivers seat I say fairly because even though ive been much more comfortable in a car I never got sore during my 35 minute commute each way every day I was driving my one month old Pontiac Grand Prix GTP Daytona 500 Pace Car please read my review on that when some bozo in a Honda Accord pulled out in front of me I was NOT happy Nobody was hurt seriously I broke his car literally in two His insurance paid for the 12 000 repair to the front end of my limited edition car I ll bet they were really happy with him His insurance also paid for a rental while my car was in the shop from September 2 to December 15 no joke
Neg,Strengths The Taurus has an excellent ride quality The gauges are goodsized and understandable and the overall roominess is great Weaknesses This definately isnt not_the not_greatest not_car not_Ford not_has not_ever not_built When you give it about half throttle it shifts pretty rough When you accelerate real lazy it shifts smooth out of first It doens t even come close to matching the other competitors acceleration figures It somewhat lacks in the quality department Kind of ironic considering their slogan Quality is Job 1 With the upgraded suspension it takes in bumps smoothly and even corners quite well for a midsized car Our van only does about 1900 2000 at this speed Also mechanically im not not_to not_impressed not_with not_the not_transmission not_on not_this not_car The seats are comfortable and well supportive and the controls though some looking quite tacky are in easy reach and easy to use It is equipped with the 3 0L Vulcan engine and theres not not_too not_much good I can say about that First the car is very underpowered The circular rear window somewhat hinders rear vision and the bulge at the top of the doors make it kind of hard to use the side mirrors Overall I personally wouldnt not_really not_recommend not_this not_car not_to not_anyone not_especially not_if not_you not_look not_at not_other not_cars not_out not_there not_in not_this not_price not_range not_hondas not_toyotas not_etc Also under hard acceleration the engine has noticeable vibration and is quite loud for a supposedly refined V 6 Also the axle ratio on this car is extremely low at around 3 90 1 This means it revs really high and not not_that not_high not_of not_a not_speed not_Also in overdrive it hits about 2300 2400 rpm while cruising at 65mph But then when you floor it it shifts smooth again Figure that one out Also when it shifts from second to third at no matter what speed it almost sounds like the engine hesitates before continuting on Lastly the design of this model year Taurus is pretty bad Its way too bubble shaped as my girlfriend says
Neg,The interior is very comfortable and roomy The Ford Taurus is a perfect example of this paradox When researching this particular vehicle you will find raving reviews from many reviewers everyone from housewives to the consumer reports When purchasing a new or used vehicle one always wants to be as knowledgeable as possible about the options available However sometimes no amount of research can prepare you for the treachery that lies ahead when you make an error purchasing a vehicle The problem is or it appears that generally when a person is attesting to or commenting on the reliability of a car particularly a new car it is generally before the problems have taken place The Ford Taurus is relatively pleasing to look at with its sporty areo dynamic design The ride is quiet and smooth and it generally gets very reasonable fuel mileage Having all these things going for it however does not not_alleviate not_the not_frustration not_of not_the not_fact not_that not_there not_have not_been not_so not_many not_recalls not_on not_many not_different not_areas not_of not_the not_vehicle not_transmission not_steering not_stabilizers not_air not_conditioning not_electrical not_system not_etc not_that not_it not_spends not_more not_time not_in not_the not_repair not_facility not_than not_it not_does not_in not_a not_driveway As well I was incredibly disappointed and frustrated with the attitude and the lack of concern shown by the Ford Motor Company when notified of the seemingly chronic problems that arose with the vehicle Although this vehicle has been rated very highly in the safety tests performed on vehicles in this class and although it is a pleasing vehicle as far as aesthetics A consumer would certainly want to take into account the potential lack of reliability as well as the difficulty in getting the adequate and appropriate service performance from Ford Motor Company that would make this car acceptable to own
Neg,It runs terribly The car accelerates slowly and is uncomfortable As soon as I got it there were problems The car is two years old and it allready needed a new transmission The engineering is terrible given that the seatbelts bunch up and everything seems to clatter around Since then I have been in every two months to have warranty service on the car done I originally bought this vehicle because it was well priced and I thought it met all of my needs As for the positives the cruise control is easy to use I would not not_recomment not_this not_car not_to not_anyone not_who not_plans not_to not_drive not_more not_then not_5 not_mins not_a not_day not_without not_having not_to not_shoot not_themselves not_I not_would not_also not_not not_recomment not_this not_for not_someone not_who not_does not_not not_have not_5 not_hours not_a not_week not_to not_deal not_with not_the not_warranty not_service not_center not_or not_for not_someone not_who not_likes not_to not_travel not_at not_over not_15 not_miles not_per not_hour
Neg,If they all run like this then I would not not_recommend not_it After having my second child I wanted a family car so I purchased the Ford Taurus The car ran fine for the first 2 years after that it has not not_been not_the not_same The backseat is large enough that with 2 children they cannot not_reach not_each not_other not_with not_is not_a not_plus If that is the way all Ford Tauruses run then they have a problem I do like the roominess of the interior and the trunk It has trouble shifting from first to second gear and the dealership said they could find nothing wrong with it That is just the way it runs The speedometer odometer and power steering all went out It was still under warranty so we took it back to the dealership and they fixed the speedometer odometer and power steering but now 6 months later it is still not not_running not_right The trunk is large enough to fit luggage and a stroller in it If I just lucked into a bad one in the bunch and they are not not_all not_like not_this not_then not_this not_would not_be not_a not_good not_car not_for not_people not_with not_children
Neg,My dad bought this car used This definately isnt not_the not_greatest not_car not_Ford not_has not_ever not_built When you give it about half throttle it shifts pretty rough When you accelerate real lazy it shifts smooth out of first It doens t even come close to matching the other competitors acceleration figures Our van only does about 1900 2000 at this speed Also mechanically im not not_to not_impressed not_with not_the not_transmission not_on not_this not_car The seats are comfortable and well supportive and the controls though some looking quite tacky are in easy reach and easy to use He paid 15 000 for it It was used and had just over 28 000 miles on it So the price was right It is equipped with the 3 0L Vulcan engine and theres not not_too not_much good I can say about that First the car is very underpowered It somewhat lacks in the quality department Kind of ironic considering their slogan Quality is Job 1 Its an okay car but its not not_on not_the not_top not_of not_my not_list That is one slick car Not only is it extremely quick it is quite and incredibly smooth I personally wouldnt not_really not_recommend not_this not_car not_to not_anyone not_except not_older not_folks not_who not_dont not_drive not_too not_much The gauges are goodsized and understandable and the overall roominess is great Previous to this car my dad had a 1994 Taurus Compared to that this new Taurus is much above However a guy I know owns a 1997 Pontiac Bonneville and I would take that 10 to 1 over this car The circular rear window somewhat hinders rear vision and the bulge at the top of the doors make it kind of hard to use the side mirrors Admittedly the Taurus has an excellent ride quality With the upgraded suspension it takes in bumps smoothly and even corners quite well for a midsized car Also under hard acceleration the engine has noticeable vibration and is quite loud for a supposedly refined V 6 Also the axle ratio on this car is extremely low at around 3 90 1 This means it revs really high and not not_that not_high not_of not_a not_speed not_Also in overdrive it hits about 2300 2400 rpm while cruising at 65mph But then when you floor it it shifts smooth again Figure that one out Also when it shifts from second to third at no matter what speed it almost sounds like the engine hesitates before continuting on Lastly the design of this model year Taurus is pretty bad Its way too bubble shaped as my girlfriend says He needed a low mileage vehiclee because hes a salesman and piles on the miles incredibly in this thing After about 10 months of use hes already put over 55 000 miles on it Its been okay so far but im hoping he ll replace it really soon and getting something much better like a Buick Regal or something I almost have him convinced on that car The Taurus is my dads car
Neg,It drives me nuts But it didnt not_fix not_the not_problem I bought this car in the summer of 2001 If so the car will still have been a bargain despite its annoyances So to sum up I havent exactly been thrilled with the Taurus If not I would have been better off buying a new Camry or Accord Thus for me the big question is whether the powertrain will hold up over the long haul There was subtle brake pedal vibration at 30 k miles and by 50 k it wasnt not_subtle not_any not_more And seventh at 50 k miles I had to replace both front brake rotors and both rear brake drums because they were all warped The fifth annoyance is that the entire center console between the two front seats seems to have one main function creaking and squeaking True I can afford a lot of small repairs with the 8000 or so I saved by not not_buying not_a not_new not_Camry not_or not_Accord So far I have not not_had not_to not_fix not_anything not_really not_major but I have been perturbed by a number of small annoyances If im experiencing these problems in the first 60 k what is it going to be like at 120 k That shouldnt not_happen not_Even not_before not_I not_bought not_the not_car not_Id not_heard not_that not_the not_rotors not_warp not_easily not_on not_these not_cars and that has certainly been my experience The dealer fixed this for free under the terms of a 3 month 3000 mile warrantee that came with the car Second the 6 CD changer never worked right It wont play a CD in the 1 slot I complained about this to the dealer when I brought the car back for the problem mentioned above and he replaced the CD changer unit First days after I purchased the car there was a problem with a sensor governing the cooling system it made the cooling fan run all the time so that the car ran too cold on the highway When this happened I had to turn on the headlights which turned on the dashboard lights to work the radio or A C Very annoying Even weirder the problem hasnt recurred in nearly a year At that point the car was just over 3 years old and had 23 000 miles on it It was a one owner local trade in and an internet title search revealed no major accidents floods or other problems I paid US 10 500 Check your owners manual its clearly marked and easy to do Fourth another strange electrical problem has seemed to go away inexplicably on its own for a while all of the lighted information on the center console radio clock A C info etc would disappear at random intervals Either I got two bad units with the same problem or the problem lay somewhere else Since I sometimes have more pressing matters than dealing with this stuff I never went back to the dealer again about the CD unit and live with a 5 CD changer instead It squeaks and creaks constantly I ll mention this to the dealer when I take it in for the door ajar problem but im not not_optimistic not_about not_them not_fixing not_it not_so not_it not_doesnt not_creak not_and not_squeak not_Sixth not_with not_60 not_k not_on not_the not_car not_im not_noticing not_the not_beginnings not_of not_a not_leaky not_valve not_cover not_gasket not_which not_will not_need not_to not_be not_replaced As of this writing 2 years later the car has 60 000 miles on it I am religious about scheduled maintenance so the car has been well taken care of I put a lot of miles on it in the first 15 months I had it but have since relocated and now only drive it about 10 k a year This used to be a job for the do it yourselfer I did one once on an old Mercury Comet V 8 and im not not_all not_that not_handy not_really but these days the way engines are crammed into tiny engine compartments I woudnt want to try it myself on the Taurus A leaky valve cover gasket can happen eventually to any car but shouldnt not_happen not_at not_60 not_k not_in not_my not_opinion Third like several others in this forum my Taurus has problems with the door is ajar sensor Its completely unpredictable Sometimes it thinks for days that a door is ajar then suddenly the light goes off and all is well again for a while I havent had time to get this fixed yet so in the meantime I yanked the circuit breaker for the interior lights
Neg,Back in December 1995 Then they fixed the two problems All the U Joints and CV Joints were replaced twice Oh well I just hoped nothing would happen The radiator and fan not not_the not_fan not_belt not_but not_the not_fan was replaced three times We had to go back over there and pay 800 dollars more They left such a taste of vile in my mouth I have a Jeep now and its wonderful Ford may you rot in a garbage can your service and vehicles are way below acceptable standards They also said it was past my warranty I sent it in two weeks before it expired you get the idea I will never buy or claim ownership another Ford product again Well they didnt not_install not_a not_second not_switch not_to not_cut not_off not_the not_alarm should the remotes die or the alarm short circuits I discovered this 6 months later and they said there was nothing they could do about it unless I paid First thing I did when driving out of the dealership was get new snow tires it snowed that night Well during the course of owning this vehicle for 4 and half years I put about 50 000 miles on it Not too bad I went through 5 sets of complete breaks When I got the car I noticed the antenna was bent and the windshield wiper motor was shot Brought it to a closer Lincoln Dealer to have these items fixed under warranty to discover the dealership I purchased it from signed me up under their own extended warranty not not_the not_Ford not_warranty not_which not_I not_specified not_10 not_different not_times I purchased a 1995 Ford Thunderbird LX V8 with 15 000 miles on it When I was handed the keys after signing all the paperwork and had put a deposit on 4 days prior when I first test drovie it the car now had 16 000 miles on it One of the salesman decided he was going to use this car to commute back and forth to work this was the start of my problems I specifically had a car alarm installed by the dealer as my prior vehicle a convertible Suzuki Sidekick which was an absolutely wonderful vehicle was a target for theives Lets see the transmission was rebuilt twice the driver side window would stick on occasion and not not_shut not_completely not_the not_radio not_was not_awful and the kicker the Ford service people dont not_know not_what not_the not_problem not_is not_Ooooohhhh not_I not_get not_so not_steamed not_when not_I not_think not_of not_this I find out toward the end of my warranty after dealing with countless service people being rude to me telling me it was a figment of my imagination that the car is stalling and three dealerships to figure out that there was no oil in the engine even though the dipstick said there was oil They told me that happens when an engine gets old and refused to fix it under warranty During the time I owned this vehicle I contacted Ford corporate repeatedly and they never responded Finally 2 months before the warranty ended someone called me back all sarcasm aside they finally tell me there is a dispute settlement board oh I was supposed to get a free loaner anytime my car was in the shop for warranty repairs Never got it now I wanted my money back The Dispute Settlement board refused and conveniently stated this is between me and the individual dealerships
Neg,The trunk space is also limited These little luxuries really make for a nicer driving experience It truly was great until we had our daughter This vehicle has a V 8 which both my husband and I enjoy This is fine if theres just one or two of you on a short road trip It might be ok for short rides but for longer trips it would be uncomfortable This car only has two doors and putting her in and taking her out of the carseat can be difficult at times It also has all the little luxuries the premium sound system CD player sun roof keyless entry leather seats power seats windows and locks and automatic climate control This was a great car for us before we had children and will make a great car for my husband when we buy a more family friendly vehicle If you re single or a young couple without children this would be great for you If not not_spend not_your not_money not_on not_a not_four not_door not_sedan not_or not_a not_mini not_van My husband fell in love with this car when he saw it on the Ford dealerships lot We needed another vehicle as I had totaled our Ford Taurus the previous month If you re riding in the back seat behind someone who needs more leg room in the front you can get cramped if you re tall as well One would fit in the trunk the other had to go in the back seat Thankfully at that point we didnt not_have not_our not_daughter and we could put the suitcase there If you re trying to go for longer distances with more luggage forget it I went to the airport one time to pick up my sister in law and she brought two large suitcases
Neg,The car has good styling and roominess The electronic traction assist although doesnt The semi automatic climate control isnt not_the not_greatest The two major downfalls on this car are its handling and brakes The brakes are typical Ford not not_enough not_for not_the not_vehicle This could be fixed if you are an avid automotive lover by aftermarket springs The premium sound stereo is not not_bad not_for not_a not_factory not_unit and will make most people happy It originally was the leading sports car from the Us until Chevrolet started making a more potent Corvette The seats could use more support though Long rides might be tiresome for those that prefer stiffer seats All the controls are well laid out to give you a sports car feel but not not_the not_sports not_cars not_lack not_of not_space It always sits high in the back which might be taking away from downforce on the rear for better traction The pride in owning a Thunderbird is in its nameplate a nameplate with history More history than the Camaro Firebird Trans Am and Mustang On anything less than clean dry roads you will have to pay attention to what the car is doing You will be able to stop but you ll wish you had more brakes than you do The ABS works well The power from the 4 6L engine is impressive and a pleasure when on the highway I wouldnt not_opt not_for not_the not_3 not_8L not_v not_6 not_for not_a not_car not_this not_size The six way power drivers seat is nice to get you in just the right position and the tilt wheel will help finish getting you into that right position The power is comparable to a Mustang GT or Sport Package Crown Victoria Its size is more roomier than a Mustang and with a few upgraded parts would probably run better than the Mustang I have leased a 97 Thunderbird now for almost 3 years I have had it since it was new I leased the car based on its nameplate and v 8 power There arent many positions to bring just fresh air in Most times you are either using the heater or the air conditioning These extremes will do the job though I do prefer the older R 12 refrigerant though it does a much better job at cooling the interior than the newer R 134a This is easy to tell though by the feel you get in the seat Much of this might have to do with the independent rear suspension I dont not_believe not_Ford not_put not_enough not_effort not_into not_putting not_the not_right not_springs not_in not_the not_rear not_of not_the not_car These would level the look of the car and lower it just a little all this would enhance the independent suspension Many finer cars from BMW Mercedes Benz the Corvette all use this type of suspension to give their cars a better ride If Ford had done a little more work the Thunderbird would have been a much better car This car is not not_for not_novice not_drivers not_or not_drivers not_who not_cant not_keep not_an not_eye not_on not_what not_their not_car not_is not_doing not_For not_those not_drivers not_who not_like not_a not_challenging not_car not_or not_a not_car not_that not_would not_test not_their not_driving not_skills not_this not_is not_the not_car not_for not_you not_I not_am not_still not_undecided not_on not_whether not_or not_not not_I not_will not_purchase not_this not_car not_at not_the not_end not_of not_its not_lease
Neg,That oval motif abounds including dashboard instrument panel mirrors and trim elements The design makes for a clean shape and clear sight lines from the cockpit The standard four cylinder engine is underpowered at high speeds and noisy at any speed As a highway car though its a dog even worse than its grandparent the Pinto The cabin is relatively comfortable although cramped and the trunk affords plenty of storage room At idle it sounds suspiciously like a sewing machine at full throttle the noise can drown out the radio On the rare occasions that ms scmrak lets me have it I drive a Toyota Tacoma otherwise its a Honda Accord The accelerator pedal For better or for worse the Escorts built on Fords oval concept like the redesigned Taurus and the Contour The engine runs smoothly and efficiently with good mileage in the 27 30 range for my two weeks and 1087 miles of mixed highway and city driving This is especially true for condo dwelling attorneys and accountants who insist on driving diesel powered duallys and SUVs the size of school buses Theres not not_a not_single not_thing not_wrong not_with not_driving not_a not_small not_car not_in not_fact not_its not_generally not_my not_opinion not_that not_there not_is not_something not_wrong not_with not_driving not_BIG not_cars My sample which now has slightly below 11 000 miles under its fanbelt has developed a few rattles and squeaks plus a tendency to buzz at certain engine speeds The interior has plenty of headroom but the door openings are short sometimes painfully so as passengers are prone to bumping heads while entering and exiting The air conditioning unit struggled to cool the car in direct sunlight even though Houston topped out at 75 degrees F while I was driving the Escort The vehicle handles nimbly at low speeds the steering is responsive Overall the construction is on par with or exceeds similar American made cars and approaches the quality of Japanese economy imports If you can drive a manual transmission it would be a better option for this vehicle the combination of a puny power plant with an automatic transmission is unsettling at highway speeds The brake pedal Fords fascination with that oval design motif extends too far in at least one case the side view mirrors afford a dangerously small field of vision particularly at the outer edges In fact it makes a pretty good car for running errands around town it scoots into parking places neatly turns on a dime and has a fairly roomy trunk for your purchases Authors note this is not not_a not_review not_of not_the not_ZX2

excellent example of the timeworn maxim you get what you pay for Ford doesnt squander much of its budget on amenities which is a good idea for an economy car Unfortunately they dont not_squander not_much not_on not_engine not_power not_either Theres nothing particularly wrong with that little four banger it gets around 27 MPG on the highway come to think of it though ive driven 8 cylinder cars that get upwards of 24 Likewise theres nothing particularly wrong with the Escort design its neither attractive nor unattractive just sort of a blah little car Where the rubber meets the road Overall the car is as mentioned above a good example of getting what you pay for If you have enough cash for a tricked out Escort though Id strongly suggest getting yourself a similarly priced version of an import it will hold its value longer and very likely be less prone to problems involving design and workmanship So when the rental agency couldnt give me a standard car for my two week rental I

Neg,I bought a 1990 White Ford Probe in 1994 The bottom line is steer clear of this car if you can It had a manual transmission a sunroof power windows power door locks and tinted windows It had 60 000 miles on it and according to my mechanic was in good shape It drove very well and it was my favorite car but that did not not_last not_very not_long not_I not_had not_to not_take not_it not_to not_the not_shop not_to not_get not_a not_new not_transmission not_after not_having not_it not_only not_four not_months not_I not_also not_had not_several not_other not_problems not_which not_I not_will not_not not_go not_into not_at not_this not_time The engine was totally melted which basically the car was totaled I did not not_take not_any not_action not_against not_Ford but if I knew what I know now I would have I have heard from at least two other people who had owned ford probes that the same thing happened to them The culmination of the problems was when the engine BURNED up in 1996 I was driving down the highway when all of the sudden smoke starts coming out of the hood I pull over look at the hood and almost open it before I noticed flames shooting out from under the hood Luckily I had a cellular phone with me and called 911 to get them to extinguish my car
Neg,So my opion is do not not_buy not_a not_old not_probe not_it not_is not_nothing not_but not_headache I bought a 1990 ford probe gl in 1998 i payed 2500 00 for it used the car was a very good deal at the time I am a certified mechanic so i check out the car throughly Finding nothing really wrong with the car i purchased it About 6 months after i bought it the rack and pinion went out 1 week after that the radiator went out with the lower control arm the headlight motors the exhaust system the automatic seatbelts the passenger side mirror the power steering pump the rocker arms and oh yeah finally the fuel pump wires arched against the gas tank when i ws driving and the back of the car went up in flames I got out in time before it was too late
Neg,But there is a bright side The car gets excellent gas mileage We ve been driving this car now for two weeks As a rental you cant not_beat not_the not_price not_19 not_99 not_a not_day We have had to leave at least 5 to 10 minutes early so we can get this car out of PARK A simple test drive wont tell you how it performs in your daily lives and it is far better to spend that extra 50 to make sure it will You need to start hitting the gas pedal hard about 500 feet before you climb a hill or else it simply will max out and everyone is passing you Park Place This little car may be economical but it certainly is comical when it comes to the horsepower this thing has To put it bluntly it sucks on hills As a first family car I would also recommend it In fact I recommend everyone should rent the vehicle they intend on buying for a week to see if it will meet all of their expectations In these days of high gas prices it cost us 15 00 to fill the tank up and it lasted for a good 200 miles of mostly highway driving Our Ford Ranger guzzles about double that but it is a 20 gallon tank but gets only about 100 miles more than the Escort Price They did not not_have not_any not_available but the guy told me that if the shift would not not_move not_out not_of not_PARK not_to not_push not_this not_little not_flat not_black not_button not_next not_to not_the not_stick and it would release the shift and allow me to push the shifts button all the way in so I can move out of PARK NOW HE TELLS ME The button that releases the stick is a crap shoot if you get it to push in so it will release the shift I spent 10 minutes of my lunch hour yesterday trying to get it out of park I swore that when I did I was going right to the rental place to exchange cars I havent driven an Escort since my 1993 model and now I know why Our Ford Ranger XLT was involved in an auto accident a few weeks ago so our rental car is this 1999 Ford Escort Now ive owned a Ford Escort before it was a 1993 model and after two blown headgaskets a new radiator major engine work and 1500 later I traded it in for my first truck which was a Toyota 4X2 until I traded that in for the Ford Ranger Now that you know why I am driving this Ford Escort let me tell you about it Dwarf Ponies or maybe mice
Neg,The sun visors are too small So up went the windows We smoke I know shame shame We travel a lot its a hour to RAs family The only thing that is not not_is not_the not_seat not_belts With the many MANY other brands and types of cars out there This is a 99 4 door RA was rear ended The dash lights come on automatically when the car is running Ok the dash center consul the radio controls and heat controls all sort of blend in together The headlights which can be moved a bit are two low and outward Go figure Our older Escort had automatic seat belts and thats the only thing I just find that funny If I won a free one in a contest I would sale it Ok We had a 1989 Ford Escort 2 door Well when we cracked the widows to smoke the design of this car the water poured in the windows Never before aside from when I was pregnant have I gotten car sick on this trip nor did my kids Or maybe he can sense how uncomfortable we all are I like driving the car but RA doesnt He carrys on at least half the trip in the 99 and I think its the way he rides in this thing too This is the rental car they gave us to use Ok What I really dont not_like not_is not_the not_electronic not_windows The worst thing so far we were heading home first really warm day and we had the windows down it started to rain They werent even open a half of a inch I have rode in MANY cars and had windows cracked open over the years We all ended up car sick half way there and had to make a emergency stop Something else the baby would sleep most of the trip in our car So at least once a week we travel there I didnt not_like not_the not_way not_this not_car not_rides not_After not_half not_the not_trip not_toward not_his not_family not_I not_decided not_I not_hate not_the not_way not_it not_rides Then laughed hysterically at me only because he had done the same thing making it back to the house and noticeing the light on till he got his boots on and back out side it was off The only advantage this has over our older model is three seat belts instead of two and four doors instead of two I just feel I found more cons with having this thing here for two weeks Ok we arent rich and cant not_afford not_a not_new not_car but I have had the experience of this thing If I did have the money for a new car this would be one of the LAST cars I would pick The dome light stays on till you start the car or for a time after you get out Talk about frustration till we learned all these things out Also maybe you will find this funny as I didnt and do now The first time I drove this car after dark after unloading kids handing them bags sending them toward the house I loaded up the last of everything into my arms and kicked the door shut almost losing half my load Which is a danger to me in a vehicle accident being in the Ambulance for 12 plus years electric windows and things of that make it a lot harder to access a vehicle once a battery is cut have to take out a window if the doors are locked When night time comes and you turn on the head lights the stupid dash lights dim yeah there is a knob to brighten them but not not_as not_much as we would like Its not not_exactly not_easy not_on not_gas not_as not_I not_was not_figured not_it not_would not_be not_It not_uses not_more not_than not_our not_10 not_year not_older not_car not_Pretty not_much not_the not_same not_motor At least 8 off of the top of my head and this is the only time thats happened Granted I will give you the safety features have to have break depressed to put in or out of gear Locks on master window controls so that only the driver can control all the windows BUT that stinks because when its on I cant not_open not_and not_close not_my not_window There is a lot of better choices to pick Sure I gave you a lot of things I dont not_like not_about not_this not_car But I feel the pros are few and this car would make a poor choice for anyone Maybe thats because I dont not_have not_the not_money not_for not_a

Neg,The ride is OK The cassette player died after 1 year That is not not_very not_economical not_in not_my not_book They only last for about 20 000 to 30 000 miles The passenger side window failed to close after 3 months The cheapest tires I found were 91 00 and supposedly only Goodyear makes them But sometimes looks can be deceiving Its a snappy little car and it does get good gas mileage Do your homework when buying any vehicle Dont get stuck with an economical vehicle that costs too much to maintain The tires on this car are 15 This would not not_be not_a not_problem not_if not_you not_were not_not not_worried not_about not_the not_cost not_to not_replace not_them My first new car purchase was a ZX2 I wanted a car that was economical on gas I really liked the way it looked too The struts seem a little stiff even after a year of driving it I think Ford could have done a much better job of creating this vehicle But dont not_try not_to not_smoke not_a not_cigarette not_when not_its not_raining not_out not_The not_water not_drips not_right not_into not_the not_window not_Its not_really not_a not_hassle not_Its not_not not_from not_the not_rain not_coming not_from not_the not_sky not_either not_its not_the not_rain not_wiped not_from not_the not_windshield not_that not_gets not_you not_Mostly not_it not_drips not_right not_onto not_the not_controls not_for not_the not_locks not_and not_windows
Neg,However most of my driving is done on Highway 101 in California If you re a larger human being you wont appreciate any of this The brakes are also correspondingly weak and squeaky and cornering at highway speeds is not not_very not_secure not_feeling This would be a very nice car for running around town especially if you re a woman This is where the two biggest weaknesses of the Escort are revealed it sucks on the freeway and the gas tank is really really small Theres a surprising amount of interior space for such a small car plenty for me although I never use the back seats so I can only speak for the front seats It handles decently especially in confined spaces like parking lots is extremely easy to park and goes in and out of first gear fairly snappily if somewhat twitchily The trunk is also quite roomy for a subcompact I managed to shove a huge computer box in there which wouldnt not_fit not_into not_the not_trunk not_of not_a not_midsize not_sedan I recently rented a late model Escort for a month im not not_one not_of not_those not_people not_whose not_identities not_are not_shaped and or expressed by a cool car the more anonymous the better is my motto This car has no pickup at highway speeds now that the speed limit in many states has been increased this is a bigger concern than it might have been a couple years ago Few cars are more generic than a beige Escort I kept mistaking other cars for my rental once even accidentally setting off the alarm on a similar looking sedan I cravenly ran away before the owner could show up Under 45 miles per hour and 6 feet of driver height this is generally a decent utilitarian car The ride is also extremely rattle y like small parts might be about to break off at any moment Finally with my 50 mile daily commute it seems like I rattle my way from one gas station to the next I havent been blown away by the mileage im achieving either which seems to be less than 20 miles per gallon Finally this car is clearly designed for shorter drivers im 5 4 The steering wheel is small the car rides low the dash is low the ignition key is set super low and the seat can be pushed forward so far your thighs can be trapped under the console
Neg,The Windstar is a functional piece of machinery On the highway this machine floats like a 1970 Cadillac In a 2001 vehicle I was looking for more up to date features and gadgets We road on 4 good P215 70R15 BSW tires w 15 inch 5 spoke wheel coverings It also features a passive anti theft system cupholders and a locking glove box with a light installed The simple dashboard with the typical Ford layout is boring Ford is notorious for its poor ergonomics and dashboard layout When driving this vehicle you can really feel front wheel drive the pulling to the front wheels The Windstars steel body is very rigid despite its rack and pinion steering system its considered a heavyweight in the minivan world The front suspension uses the highly recommended MacPherson struts while at the rear a twist beam axle acts as its own stabilizer bar with its suspension coil springs The van is a little bouncy on the road probably due to the soft suspension that seems to sway when driving In 1996 there was a recall on the rear power windows because the connections failed and the wiper switch needed to be replaced If you ve ever road in a 1970 Cadillac you will remember how it almost floats like a boat on the highway If you ve ever taken a trip with a bunch of teenagers then you know the importance of traveling in the right vehicle This passenger van has a savage V 6 12 valve 4 speed electronic automatic transmission engine with an electronic ignition Its almost identical to its 2000 Windstar predecessor with its 3 0 liter 6 cylinder engine There is nothing fancy about the outside since exterior features are fairly rudimentary red color Its red from the front and rear colored bumpers to the red colored grille It would be ideal if Ford would match safety and customer satisfaction I was looking for a little bit more out of a 2001 The other families in our neighborhood referred to us as the Brady Bunch The Brady Bunch was 1969 ABC TV series in which the Brady family used a 1958 Plymouth Station Wagon As a Social Worker I find myself on the Georgia highways and byways usually doing a lot of commuting especially when it comes to traveling with a group of children The Windstars seven passenger seating offers lots of room and comfortable seating for smaller framed people however if you are traveling with a teenagers wearing baggy clothes it seats five comfortably The models or trims which is a term used in the automotive world to describe the different styles available which includes your base model the LX SE SEL the limited or the SE Sport The Windstar is synonymous with practical family transportation and although I dont not_consider not_it not_stylish not_and not_find not_it not_to not_plain not_for not_my not_taste not_for not_some not_this not_versatile not_vehicle is becoming as popular as the 1968 Plymouth Station Wagon Which brings me to my most recent outing to the movies with my group of weekend pre teens in the 2001 Ford Windstar LX Frankly as a bachelor the minivan would not not_be not_my not_first not_choice not_as not_a not_slime not_and not_trim not_sporty not_auto The safety system includes dual stage front air bags crash severity sensors safety belt usage sensor driver seat position sensor and safety belt pretensions plus the lift gate comes with a high mounted lamp which provides excellent light at night However if you get a flat you ll be riding around on a donut since this vehicle comes with a mini spare tire The Windstar 2001 LX uses unleaded gas yet guzzles it like a 1970 Cadillac Primarily due to its style since minivans usually have family written all over them However for those looking for a family van you may find one of the six models of the 2001 Ford Windstar to your liking So far it has not not_been not_reported not_that not_the not_Windstar not_2001 not_faces not_the not_challenges not_of not_its not_predecessors not_Its not_been not_noted not_by not_Ford not_that not_the not_Windstar not_is

engine is not not_the not_most not_economical not_Albeit not_my not_experience not_with not_the not_Windstar not_LX not_was not_limited and in spite of this vans impressive safety rating this vehicle would not not_be not_my not_first not_choice not_for not_family not_travel The vehicle we used was the Windstar 2001 LX passenger van The Windstar van made me feel like I was turning into my father I immediately began having flashbacks of our station wagon and all the family discussion regarding that vehicle On the dashboard you will find the typical analog instrumentation with a tachometer trip odometer water temp gauge and the usual warning indicators including the oil pressure battery lights on key in ignition low fuel low washer fluid door ajar brake fluid the only thats new to me is the bulb failure light There are three rows of seats the front bucket seats with the fixed headrest and armrest remind are fairly comfortable for the driver however you can only adjust these two seats so far Perhaps in a 2001 I was expecting a softer seat or perhaps captain chairs like the seat on the Star Trek Enterprise Although the daytime running lights are popular I personally dont not_like

the drivers side which seemed unusual at first and took a little getting use to This van is ideal for people that want to use their minivan for a small business because it allows you the ability to toss out the rear bench seat The Ford Windstar is an affordable minivan ranging between 20 000 to 35 000 depending upon the model you choose Although there are no recalls on the Windstar 2001 LX this particular Ford has a history of recalls and mechanical problems
Neg,Leased a 2001 Ford Windstar LX maintenance package daytime running lights safety package etc Our first oil change we had to leave the van for 5 hours FORD has very poor quality control over dealers Our 4th FORD Van with each FORD has gotten worse our last The day running lights generate an error on the dash that must be canceled to view mileage etc every time you start the van Air conditioner makes a loud clunk when you first turn it on Poor controls on the onboard video system Seats are very heavy and hard to get in and out Purchased the regular maintenance package on the basis of Oil Change is same as Quick Lube Service We really want to like this vehicle but the number of irritations makes it impossible Soem are the quality of the vehicle some are dealer together they generate a very bad ownership experience First it is a Gas Guzzler 13 MPG dealer Ford of Upland CA says so what The electronics are sloppy the Auto Mirrors Seats and Day Running Lights Dont Work The Memory adjustments for the seats and mirrors reset to neutral every time you hit the unlock button Dealer says Just reprogram why have memory if you have to adjust them each time you get in
Neg,We ve also had transmission problems The brakes have even stopped working once When they do fix it we end up with a different noise the next month We usually dont not_use not_it not_for not_long not_trips not_unless not_we not_have not_a not_lot not_of not_stuff not_to not_carry However when we take the van to the Ford place to get it fixed the mechanics claim that they dont not_hear not_the not_noises Also the brake warning light is constantly coming on leading to road trips in which we worry if we ll make it home safely My moms credit card bill has risen because of repairs on this minivan Perhaps you would be blessed to find one of the good ones but I wouldnt not_risk not_it We ve had problems with all sorts of noises there have been times when we had noises whenever the car turned and noises when you apply the brakes Once we even had to take it back the week after taking it to the shop Further taking the car to the shop is a day long event or longer and a major incovenience I admit that im not not_much not_of not_a not_mechanic not_so not_this not_will not_not not_be not_detailed not_or not_technical not_I not_ll not_just not_get not_to not_the not_basics not_Six not_years not_ago not_my not_parents not_bought not_a not_1996 not_Ford not_Windstar not_and not_today not_its not_a not_constant not_pain It turns out that the Ford Windstar was recalled because of brake problems but not not_the not_1996 although it appears that there was reason to Apparently we were among the truly blessed since others have had accidents caused by head gasket problems The epinions site wouldnt not_let not_me not_put not_the not_link not_here not_for not_you not_it not_read not_it not_as not_a not_word not_that not_was not_too not_long not_but not_look not_it not_up not_at not_consumeraffairs not_com not_All not_in not_all not_it not_seems not_sorry not_compared not_to not_our not_Toyota not_Camry not_which not_we not_rarely not_have not_to not_take not_to not_the not_shop not_and not_when not_we not_do not_the not_service not_is not_much not_better not_Over not_the not_years not_we not_have not_spent not_thousands not_on not_fixing not_this not_car
Neg,This car does not not_have not_great not_reliability Of course it likes hi octane gas The car came with Goodyear Eagle GT tires Id care to repeat 2 Overall poor design At best the Mustang GT 5 0 gets around 15 mpg Now that im somewhere around 30 its just noise pollution For a while my husband could control them from his side It looked cool with front and rear spoilers and ground effects It had a low throaty growl that just sounded tough The car has the worst turning radius of any car ive ever driven When I was 20 I thought this was kewl i The car could go faster but we were gaining too quickly on some state troopers ahead In true muscle car tradition there is also no insulation from the road noise and the engine noise Whatever money you have left after filling it with gas will go to repairs It is terrible for long road trips as the seats are only comfortable for about 20 30 minutes All you ll get is a little slap slap as you re looking for the horn The horn is contained in two little buttons on the steering wheel with the air bag taking up the center space With the original tires on a dry road the car was a lot of fun to drive After a disastrous encounter with a drunk driver in 1989 my husband bought this car new with the insurance money It was fine for the first one or two years and then it slowly began to fall apart In addition to the aforementioned repairs the sporty nature of the car means that equipment is expensive too The shape of the hatchback leaves the last foot of space virtually unusable as it is only about 8 high The instrument panel and stereo are made up of lots of little buttons impossible to use if you re wearing gloves There is no such thing as a 3 point turn in this car Try 5 or 7 points to get this car turned around On the other hand even when we sold it last year 3500 at 10 years old and around 120 000 miles it still turned heads Then they died altogether and I had to climb in from the drivers side or sit in the back Not easy to do in formalwear On the other you dont not_feel not_your not_own not_crack not_either and you climb out of the car waddling like the Brady Bunch after they took the mule ride into the Grand Canyon But the wheel size is odd and pretty much the only tires that would fit were performance Goodyear Eagles and Yokohama tires that didnt not_last not_all not_that not_long not_30 not_000 not_40 not_000 not_miles If you are 5 7 like me or shorter you ll get a red welt on the side of your neck from the rubbing shoulder belt 3 Things just break over and over again If you live in a warm sunny climate and you dont not_need not_dependable not_transportation not_the not_Mustang not_GT not_5 not_0 is fun to drive when its working Its barely comfortable for two people and cant not_carry not_much not_stuff To compare I had a similar value Ford Taurus insured through State Farm and it was about 300 a year His insurance went down a little when we got married but not not_by not_much In an emergency situation the last thing you want to do is to be looking frantically for the horn Honking the horn on this car takes finger precision you cant not_just not_slam not_on not_the not_steering not_wheel We noticed a significant difference in the pickup and in the noise between 89 octane and 93 octane Even before gas prices went nuts we d pay almost 20 to fill the tank 5 Comfort What comfort The only exception is the heat AC which are dials that are easily manipulated Same with the levers for moving the seats forward and back small difficult to find For a hatchback it does not not_have not_much not_room not_in not_the not_back At 225 hp the slightest touch on the gas would send the car hurtling forward I could pretend I was on the Batman amp Robin ride at Six Flags Somewhere around 1990 or 1991 I set my personal best land speed record on an unnamed interstate at 115 mph When I started dating my husband he d just gotten this car I did agree to marry him so I guess you could say that girls dig this car What DIDnt I like about this car The computer also did strange things from around the 5th year on For a few months the battery would drain overnight and we couldnt charge it up again After we brought it into the shop and they reset the computer it didnt not_happen not_any not_more This is a car that announces its presence Guys if you re considering buying this car and you still have a curfew this car will make it impossible for you to sneak home after hours i I also liked the power of this car Although we thought it was cool when we first got it we soon outgrew it Unfortunately we could not not_afford not_to not_replace not_it not_until not_last not_year not_when not_we not_got not_a not_NEW not_2000 not_Nissan not_Maxima not_SE not_First not_what not_did not_I not_like not_about not_this not_car There will always be a market for this car because of how it looks and sounds and because of the Mustang name and tradition I would NOT recommend this car as a teens first car it is difficult to handle even for experienced drivers and expensive to insure and maintain This was a typical conversation while driving in the Mustang i Dr kboo How do I get to RRRRRRR by the RRRRRRR i kboo Turn right at RRRRRRR and then RRRRRRR i Dr kboo WHAT i kboo Turn right at RRRRRRR and then RRRRRRR at RRRRRRR gesturing frantically HERE HERE NOW SUMMARY The check engine light would come on occasionally especially in cooler weather below 40 degrees About 50 of the time there really was something wrong and the other 50 of the time there was nothing wrong Sort of like your own version of Lotto except each ticket costs 100 and you never win 4 Its expensive Thanks to the sporty suspension the rock hard seats and the constant rumbling of the engine you get a good feel of the road every pebble and bump After about 30 minutes my butt would get numb from the vibration I dont not_know if this is a good thing or not not_on not_the not_one not_hand not_you not_no not_longer not_feel not_every not_little not_crack not_in not_the not_road After about 7 years the power windows and locks started to go They d only work some of the time sometimes the window would go down crooked and it made another loud SQUEEEEEEEE noise as it was going up and down Eventually the entire console on the passenger side just died I could not not_lock not_or not_unlock not_the not_door not_or not_raise not_or not_lower not_the not_windows In the ten years of owning this car we never found tires to fit that were under 100 apiece Insurance too was very very expensive Even with USAA which is often 1 2 or 2 3 the cost of private insurance my husband was paying around 1000 per year with a perfect driving record and in a state with low insurance rates There was never any notice that something was going wrong it would just fail to start Completely dead No turnover Somewhere around this time the A C finally died too I dont not_even not_remember not_what not_exactly not_the not_problem not_was not_I not_think not_it not_was not_a not_freon not_leak not_somewhere not_in not_the not_system not_Either not_way not_it not_was not_500 not_700 not_that not_we not_didnt not_have not_at not_the not_time We noticed a constant squeaking noise within the first year After several visits to the shop they finally determined that it was the speedometer cable After lubricating the cable the squeaking stopped For about two weeks Eventually we just learned to live with it From the 3rd to 5th years of owning it the fuel pump died three times i Each time was a 200 repair not not_to not_mention not_car not_rental There are horrendous blind spots out of both side rear windows making it difficult to pass other cars on the highway Given that the sheer power of this car makes you want to go fast on the highway it becomes very frustrating very quickly Same with the hood the slope of it makes it hard to ascertain exactly where the front end of the car is making parallel parking difficult The hatchback pistons stopped holding the hatchback in the raised position after 3 5 years and the repair lasted another 3 years Getting groceries out of the back all 4 bags of them involves lifting the hatchback in a clean and jerk motion balancing it on your head leaning way way forward remember the 8 of unusable space at the rear of the hatchback grabbing the groceries and then ducking your head out fom under the hatchback without getting clonked on the head or getting the greasy hatchback latch tangled in your hair Now repeat 4 times Where do I begin First let me say that this car was maintained very carefully even babied and garaged as often as possible Even so 1 The GT we had was an automatic transmission which made this car a lot less fun to drive Combined with a rear wheel drive and a lot of power it was almost impossible to control in bad weather Even on plowed streets the Stang had trouble getting up moderate hills Compared to my cars 89 Toyota Celica GT 90 Ford Probe GT there was a significant decrease in the amount of control even in the rain ive done donuts across 4 lane highways going 10 miles per hour in the Mustang Its not not_an not_experience The hatchback is also very heavy Opening and closing it is a full upper body workout Needless to say given that the roof of the car slopes down sharply after the front seats the rear seats are uncomfortable for anyone over 5 2 The front seats do not not_slide not_forward and the front seat belts are attached to the rear armrests so the front shoulder belt clotheslines passengers getting out of the back Ever wonder what it feels like to be born Trying to get out of the rear seats of this car is a pretty good approximation Because of the attachment of the seatbelts which seem designed for people taller than 5 7 the shoulder belt is not not_really not_adjustable
Neg,Heck my airbag isnt not_even not_functional not_right not_now not_So not_im not_looking not_into not_selling not_the not_Stang My temperature gauge read normal but there was smoke coming from underneath the car this time The only thing I didnt not_like not_at not_the not_time was that it was automatic transmission So over a weekend he and I replace the thermostat with relatively no trouble besides a few bruised and cut fingers The owner before me was quite the drag racing enthusiast so the mods included stabilizer bars dual Flowmaster exhaust and ram air intake After that the car ran like a chime For about a week Just today in fact I was stuck in traffic They may not not_beat not_a not_Stang not_or not_Camaro not_on not_the not_strip but personally I see the bends more often than a quarter mile strip It was a decent car while its problems remained hidden Besides im into fun driving Can you say Mazda Miata Toyota MR2 Turbo My entire transmission had to be rebuilt totaling about 1 750 My mother and I said to ourselves Okay this is just one problem And the thrill I get of downshifting and upshifting around a series of corners is much more exciting than getting low 9s at the strip But im afraid that the problems ive had outweigh the things I like about the car If you re into fun driving I dont not_suggest not_this not_car You get plenty of attention when cruising past the theater on a Friday night With ritualistic washing and detailing the car looks beautiful even if it has its share of dings and dents But within the second week there was a major transmission problem it wouldnt not_go not_over not_45 not_mph not_I not_guess not_it not_wouldnt not_change not_into not_the not_next not_gear not_all not_it not_did not_was not_rev not_high It ll give you good quarter mile times but dont not_expect not_to not_do not_any not_canyon not_carving not_with not_this not_car not_I not_mean not_you not_could but I know that im too scared of going into uncontrollable oversteer and driving off of a cliff There are things I like about the car Its loud and growly exhaust never gets tiring Its fast and powerful With 300 ft lbs of torque you can dust your everyday ricer and make them feel stupid for putting on those pointless decals But no worries it was free and I saved my mother at least 4 000 Ya know maybe I had a lemon I know how to take care of cars I never raced it and I treat my property with the utmost respect We ll get it fixed then that ll be it Next thing I know im stuck in traffic on Highway 4 and smoke is coming out from under my hood I call up a friend who knows more about cars than I and he suggests its an old thermostat that should be replaced Through a bizarre series of family events I attained my 1990 Ford Mustang 5 0 LX hatchback for free I had just got my license a week ago so I was thrilled to receive such a legendary car as my first car and completely for free I mean you re a 17 year old male how could you say no to 225 horsepower 300 ft lbs of torque a V8 engine with a few modifications here and there It seems that there are too many problems for me to justify keeping the car oil leak improper alignment squeaky brakes wobbly power windows the overheating insurance attention from cops etc Most of the things ive mentioned can be fixed but the thing is that after I fix it I know something else will turn up I guess it just comes with the territory of a muscle car
Neg,It costed my mom over 1 000 to fix There was tons of corrosion caked al over the battery terminals The Ford Mustang may have lots of beef but the one in my household just cant not_handle not_the not_power When she took it back to the Ford garage they admitted that a new battery had never been put in When I arrived at my destination there was enough smoke coming out from under the hood to attract the local fire department My mom took her Stang in to get a new battery and cables A week later her battery died again and she popped the hood Then after a couple months when my mom took the stang in for a rough shifting problem they told her that a part had been recalled for her model of Mustang My mother let me drive it to my prom last year and I was going to a party in which I had to travel about 4 exits on the interstate This part happened to be the exact plastic piece that heated up and cracked when I drove it Another incident is just to note the quality of our local Ford garage When I came home my mom thought that I broke it She took it to the local Ford garage and they said that a piece of plastic had blown up in front of the radiator and blocked to air flow through it This is a sign of poor engineering and I hope that since the 1997 model Ford has fixed this flaw Then they tried to tell her that they would put a new battery in but she would still have to pay for it She told them to put in the battery and that she would expect not not_to not_pay not_for not_it not_When not_she not_came not_to not_pick not_up not_the not_Stang not_Her not_bill not_said not_no not_charge not_After not_this not_attempt not_to not_cheat not_my not_mom not_out not_of not_her not_hard not_earned not_cash not_we not_have not_decided not_that not_the not_Stang not_is not_the not_last not_Ford not_we not_will not_own
Neg,To those who dont not_know not_the not_area This part of Pennsilvania is very hilly with plenty of nice low traffic sideroads But I had to remind myself that this car is actually rather inexpensive But hey what did I have to loose The first thing I noticed when I got into the car was a strange smell So rather pleased with the vehicle I arrived at my hotel planning to take it out again for a spin the next day Who had been driving this thing before Okay but back to the vehicle itself I liked the way it looked The only thing that irked me was the somewhat jerky automatic transmission yet it shifted predictably and at what seemed the right time for me It smelled like a mixture of cleaner and bananas I could explain the cleaner and then I found a ton of banana peels stuffed under the drivers seat The interior was typical for Ford Cloth seats with lots of plastic around but rather practical I dont not_mind not_that not_kind not_of not_styling not_in not_my not_truck not_but not_in not_a not_sporty not_vehicle At least as far as my visible inspection went I didnt not_have not_a not_tire not_gauge not_with not_me not_I not_didnt not_take not_to not_cars not_to not_the not_hills not_after not_that and drove it around town It was a glossy black and I like the older body style quite a bit I was surprised by its low rpm pickup realizing that it was only the six cylinder model Highway driving was great and very comfortable with enough of reserves to pass when needed I had a ball pulling it out of the parking lot and getting it onto the freeway It pains me to give a do not not_recommend not_to not_this not_vehicle because I liked it quite a bit It looks great and is very affordable im sure that one can have plenty of fun with it But I would recommend it too a friend because it is just too easy to be overconfident and use the power beyond what the car or the suspension can handle Do you know those days that seem perfect just because of a little pleasant surprise Something like that happened to me in the early spring of 98 I was traveling to King of Prussia PA and was just picking up my rental at the Philly Airport Hertz I was expecting the usual Ford Contour but I got a Ford Mustang instead I felt like I was actually able to enjoy the ride this time Let me tell you that the Mustang is normally not not_my not_kind not_of not_vehicle not_I not_think not_im not_a not_little not_too not_old not_early not_thirties not_for not_its not_target not_group and I normally prefer Japanese or German convertibles for my sport cars Taking the car through the hills and turns was something I had looked forward to Boy was I in for a surprise I was owning a Mazda Miata at that time and I approached the corners the same way I would have in the Miata The Mustang started to fishtail and I had to put quite some effort into preventing the excessive oversteer from turning into a spin I thought it was a fluke so I tried the next turn and the result was the same I slowed down quite a bit after that Returning to the hotel I checked the car Tire inflation seemed to be fine and I couldnt detect any damage to the rims
Neg,This paint job is pretty smooth It has been around since 1964 A Mustang is a wonderful all around sports car This car goes to almost 11 shows a year and has not not_gotten not_below not_2nd not_place When the sun shines on the car it turns different colors such as green blac purple blue it is relly neat looking The early years i thin are still the best cars but some of the things on this new 2000 were on the early models Such as the ring around the symbol of the Mustang My friend has a 1997 Mustang Cobra with a mystic paint job Can you say wow Can this car win some awards
Neg,The acceleration is really quite poor In conclusion this is still one cool car However another gripe I had was the sluggish handling Again a fairly minor consideration but it did lack the nippiness that I have always associated with a good sports car However these are only minor irritations The performance isnt not_great but when it looks this good its pretty easy to forgive Still I feel that if you are looking to buy a convertible then better performance may be found elsewhere Still fun to drive though It is unresponsive to the throttle and was embarrassingly beaten to the punch at the lights by several vehicles which could hardly be described as sporty Having said that the mid range power is much more pleasing there seems to be plenty of oomph under the bonnet when you put your foot down at 40 50mph This car looks good REAL good I had a handsome red model on a long term hire from a dealership in San Jose when I was working there and it certainly turned heads when I cruised down Stevens Creek Boulevard on the way home from work especially on the occasions when I was giving a lift home to Lucy a rather gorgeous blonde co worker of mine However appearances arent quite everything and the 1997 Mustang isnt not_quite not_as not_good not_as not_it not_looks not_in not_performance not_terms not_at not_least not_Put not_it not_this not_way not_you not_dont not_want not_to not_take not_it not_drag not_racing
Neg,The vehicle is small in size on the outside as well as the inside While I was determining the fate of my 1989 Toyota Camry a couple of weeks ago I had the experience of driving a 2000 Ford Focus Sedan for a week as a rental car from Accent Rental The Ford Focus which I rented was advertised as a mid sized vehicle Believe me when I tell you this vehicle is not not_mid not_sized not_in not_my not_personal not_opinion As many of you may know from reading previous epinions my oldest son is a big defensive lineman Somehow I managed to get him inside this vehicle without him being overly uncomfortable but overall the entire vehicle was way too small for my tastes After we put the seat all the way back there was no way that anyone could sit behind him even a small child If you live in an area where there are no hills this vehicle may work out for you In my personal opinion though I believe the car has no get up and go in demanding situations and I do not not_recommend not_this not_vehicle not_for not_purchase not_Features not_of not_the not_Ford not_Focus not_which not_I not_drove not_included not_4 not_Cylinder not_2 not_0 not_Liter not_110 not_Horsepower not_Engine not_Automatic not_Transmission not_Good not_MPG not_of not_27 not_MPG not_in not_the not_City not_35 not_MPG not_on not_the not_highway not_AM not_FM not_Cassette not_Radio not_Stereo not_Power not_Windows not_and not_Locks not_Air not_Conditioning not_Adjustable not_Shoulder not_Seatbelts The interior of the Focus which I drove was rather cheaply made Even though the vehicle only had about 19 000 miles on it the seats were showing signs of extreme wear both on the front and back Being that my own new car has about 1000 more miles than the Focus did the quality of my Chevrolet Impalas interior is far superior than the Focus While the overall exterior of the Focus was very attractive and the trunk space was rather roomy for a car this size there were two things which I experienced with the performance of this vehicle which gave me a total negative impression of the Focus With the air conditioning going full blast the car had no get up and go This presented problems when I was going up hills here in our area which are very steep to say the least The Focus had a hard time going up the hills and I had to give the vehicle so much gas that I thought I was going to flood the car Consequently when the week was up and I had purchased my new Impala I was very happy to turn this vehicle in I prefer to have a vehicle move when I give it the gas and do what I want it to do and the Focus performed poorly in that aspect The first thing that I really did not not_like not_about not_the not_Ford not_Focus is that the air conditioning needed to be a bit cooler in the car I realize that the week that I had driven this vehicle was one of the hottest in Atlantas history and the air quality was horrendous but I felt that any vehicle that is new on the market should be able to completely fill the vehicle with cool air on demand I found that I had to continuously run the air conditioning all of the time full blast to get this result Because I had to run the air conditioning in that manner I encountered the second problem which was more serious

Neg,We bought this car because The repair takes about half an hour You re driving a Ford What its like to drive What I hate i 1 Shopping bag hooks i The steering wheel feels solid and thick 7 Handling and gas mileage are superb The recall service called for is the replacement of the rear seat hinge This has happened to us The radio is above the climate controls and is easy to read 6 If this persists I will bring it in for a checkup You should not not_buy not_this not_car not_if not_you not_ve not_hit not_the not_mid not_life not_crisis The drivers seat goes up and down by turning a well placed dial under the seat 5 Theres a slight burning fluid smell when I do the usual sharp turns in our driveway It feels like the transmission is slipping a bit and then it catches Summary Ford Focus Wagon SE aptly fills the void between gas guzzling Ford minivans and undersized hatchbacks This is still the case even after 40 000 km i 2 Odd humming i Not a lot of tire noise coming from the wheels except for the aforementioned droning at certain speeds When engaged the cruise control accelerates roughly 4 km h and then locks onto that speed This has mostly subsided although there is still the occasional scorched smell i 4 Coffee grinding i You can wear a stetson or a foam Liberty tiara if you re heading off to a sporting event 4 When the rear seat is reclined again and in the event of a crash the rear seat might fly forward In any case here are the additional problems that have cropped up over the last few years Rear door misalignment It handles bumps well exhibits the typical wagon bounciness in the back end a casualty of a flat loading floor and corners well The rattling noise was harder to diagnose but eventually we found that there was excessive play in the sway bar bushings The anti lock brakes work although it sounds like you re grinding coffee with your brakes when it does engage This winter has been especially cold and the block heaters been used many times successfully One of the deciding factors was the slightly out there green colour of the Focus Wagon I looked at And of course the desire for a bit of variety These bushings are plastic and are not not_normally not_required not_to not_handle not_high not_loads but in our country dirt roads we occasionally hit a bump when the bushing is under load We noticed that the drivers side rear quarter panel was experiencing some abrasion on the side in front of the rear tire to the point where bare metal was showing No one will stop you on the street and ask you where you bought your car Its not not_like not_you not_re not_driving not_a not_Ferrari not_or not_one not_of not_those not_new not_swoopy not_Celicas You should buy this car if You want a practical car that carries a lot of stuff but dont not_want not_to not_spend not_a not_lot not_of not_money not_on not_gas There is a ticking noise under the hood at idle that I dont not_recall not_being not_there not_last not_year I will keep an eye on it Service update February 28 2003 The ignition wires were inspected at the major tune up at 100 000 km and found ok so they were left in there If the back seat was folded down and weight put on the forward part of the back seat the hinge that holds the rear seat down might become disengaged we ve never experienced this ourselves Other than that the car is chugging along well Fuel economy slightly improved I get about 500 km from a tank of gas this may be consistent with warmer weather as well however What im unsure about i 1 Power i im not not_sure not_I not_like not_the not_power not_of not_the not_car not_Its not_relatively not_underpowered not_compared not_to not_my not_1988 not_Toyota not_Camry not_even not_though not_they not_have not_the not_same not_size not_engine not_2 not_Litres The vibration was as a result of dirt and small pebbles that had built up on the rims of the wheels I ll be washing off those with a hose in the future and was easily fixed This was before gas prices went up 50 as well For a daily driver and a long commute car I needed something small but comfortable I was also sold on the Wagon style because I had such good experience with my 1990 Honda Wagon The bushings were replaced under warranty I ll be looking into getting an extended warranty I think Engine performance fuel economy After 33 000 km the engine is as tight as it was when delivered The only drawback of this car in the winter is the lack of obvious towing hookup points for tractors to grab on to to get you out of ditches This happened at just over 100 000 km Not bad I replaced them with cheapies that have given good service over the last 20 000 km and thats it other than oil changes We re happy with our purchase so far I expect to put about 300 000 km 180 000 miles on this car so I ll give updates every once in a while Service update March 26 2001 after 33 000 km 8 months of service i Sway bar bushings When you get used to it you can actually use this to your advantage but it does take some getting used to i 3 Turn signal colour I dont not_especially not_like not_rear not_turn not_signals not_that not_are not_red not_I not_prefer not_yellow not_The not_Focus not_Wagons not_are not_red not_Que not_sera not_sera We took the Focus Wagon into our dealer because of a vibration in the wheels at speeds exceeding 80 km h Also in between us making the appointment and taking it in I noticed a rattling in the front of the car when going over bumpy roads we have a lot in our area We re coming up on the 3 year mark for our wagon and have weathered a few more glitches but in general I remain pretty pleased with the performance with the wagon Turns out I had a chance to own a second wagon our Vanagon caught fire and turned it down for a slightly older Taurus wagon If thats the case go for the sportier engine option you ve always wanted to trick up your car with an exhaust the width of a beer can I suppose it can be done but why you need a lot of space a lot of the time Buy a minivan Conclusion In a technical service bulletin read to me at the dealership Ford says that some drivers of the Focus may encounter loss of power if a the car has less than half a tank of fuel the car has just finished a sharp sustained right turn and or c under sharp acceleration The front tires have developed an odd droning sound at 82 86 km per hour and again just above 120 km h Maybe the rotation at 25000 km will take care of that Note it has not not_taken not_care not_of not_it not_Check not_back not_here not_when not_we not_replace not_the not_tires not_after not_a not_hundred not_thousand not_kilometres not_or not_so not_i not_3 not_Fluid not_leak not_i The official explanation is that the fuel sending module has debris in it My unofficial explanation is that theres a faulty part in there and Ford should be offering to replace it In my mind its a clear safety concern and should be replaced under recall with no cost to us the consumer In waiting for this to happen I make sure as much as possible that I take right turns slowly accelerate smoothly and keep the tank over the halfway mark Major repairs to date Some major brake work at the 100 000 km mark required about 600 US in parts and labour Replacement of 4 tires This is sort of a love hate feature I love the shopping bag hooks for grocery bags on the walls of the rear cargo area I hate the shopping bag hooks because you almost have to cut the bags off to release them from the hooks especially after a bumpy driveway ride has seated them more firmly on the hooks i 2 The cruise control i We bought the Ford Focus Wagon SE because we had Ford Dollars that expired June 2000 The Ford Focus was really the only Ford that had come along in a long time that interested me The previous Ford small car Wagon the Ford Escort Wagon was adequate but I wanted more Id rented a Windstar on a long vacation trip and was impressed with the room and comfort but highly unimpressed with the gas mileage The dealer pointed out that it was likely due to the rear door being slightly out of alignment I asked it that would be covered under warranty we were over the 60 000 km mark at this point technically out of warranty and were told No They adjusted the door and now its difficult to close sometimes requiring 3 slams to get it closed We ordered anti lock brakes and the side impact air bag as well expensive options but worth it What I love 1 Solid body structure Almost like a Volkswagen except with about 50 pounds less noise insulation Also unlike the Volkswagen Passat the Focus has so far been extremely reliable in the 40000 km ive driven it that works out to about 24 000 miles 2 Theres enough trunk room for a large baby stroller and tons of groceries 3 Theres plenty of headroom But hey theres no more abrasion of gravel on that side of the car except for Paint chips missing from behind front wheel I dont not_know not_if not_a not_particularly not_energetic

of people are going to drive them soon Ford has always put a little extra effort into the styling of their station wagons and I like it The handling of the car is very forgiving Take a turn too sharp and you ll get plenty of warning before the car does something evil Driving this car quickly because of the high seating position feels like you re going about 10 km h faster than you are Adjust Slow down relax There is no excessive noise coming from the engine bay and acceleration is better than when first delivered Fuel economy has improved and we regularly get 450 km from a tank of gas we could probably get more but I get nervous when the gas gauge indicator gets below the E Service update May 6th I have started noticing a hesitation in the transmission on startup when shifting out of park and into drive or after switching from reverse to forward Hey anything that helps me stop in slippery weather is fine by me I think im leaning towards liking this feature The Recall i Part I A lot of Ford Focuses were recalled a few months back for three things 1 was interior trim corrections 2 was brake related in that brakes would lock up and wheels fall off 3 was cruise control related in that the throttle would jam open occasionally Check with your dealer to see if your car is affected Part II Our car was the subject of a recall about 3 months ago in February to fix a possible safety failure in the rear seat hinge
Neg,My current and definitive impression about the Focus was by renting it while my VW Jetta VR6 needed some repair Why having a huge trunk when the passengers in the back seats are staying with the knees at their mouths The only answer to this is for me is its poor design which suggests a waste of space and volume And when I am thinking that I had for a while the idea to pay money for it The first reaction somebody must have seating for the first time in drivers seat should be how could this car have such a cheap small interior while looking spacious from outside While they were doing the forms at Enterprise ive seen a Focus just being parked and I immediately remembered that this was one of my choices for buying a new car I was very preoccupied at that time I asked to have it and I did This car is definitely too raised from its back forcing the driver to see the road like being on a horseback Due to this the rear view is limited not not_talking not_about not_turning not_you not_head not_for not_changing not_lanes not_on not_a not_highway not_you not_wont not_see not_much not_so not_pay not_attention not_to not_the not_traffic not_ahead If you would drive with 65 miles on highway and accidentally you ll push it dont not_be not_surprised not_to not_be not_hit not_from not_the not_back there were no brake lights to warn for sudden drop of speed I didnt not_mean not_to not_compare not_a not_beauty not_like not_VW not_with not_the not_Focus not_because not_they not_cannot not_be not_even not_associated It was for me just another reason to appreciate the German engineering and the serious way in which they understand to build vehicles the Jetta was and continues to be a wonder to me that never stops amazing its driver I just asked myself how a car like Ford Focus could be manufactured in the year 2000 The second feedback comes immediately after the engine starts you have to speak louder than in the previous car you drove Its engine is very noisy and struggles each time you ask for more than riding on a 35 miles restricted road avoid climbing hills must be a warning in the owners manual Lets assume you finally drive at full speed but Orange Countys traffic like usually stops sudden I can bet you ll be asking yourself if the car will come at full stop before touching the Lexus is front of you And at last it has a feature that is rather a bug the automatic switches from D rive to N eutral without pushing the unlock button and fairly easy
Neg,This car is terrible The Brakes continued to squeak and shriek But will they develope and install these pads at no charge The Brakes shrieked on the way out of the dealership driveway There was a steady stream flowing from behind the glove box On top of all this there are the little things 1 The trunk does not not_fit not_into not_the not_body not_of not_the not_car not_properly not_2 The focus was immediately take to the dealership where it was purchased It was brought in and left for two more days and the brakes were said to have been adjusted and the oil was changed Two or three weeks later came the recalls that I have still not not_been not_notified not_of but have verified by calling Ford Customer No Service The Brake problem continues When I reach 12 000 miles the pads no longer are covered and I am told that ford is developing a new Focus specific brake pad that will not not_squeak The service advisors were extremely rude and unhelpful laughing that it would be 9 days til the car would be fixed for the leak I left the vehicle in their hands anyway in order to fix the squeaky brakes again My first dealings with the people who sold me the car were at 3 000 miles for its free first oil change I left the vehicle for the entire day and they had done nothing with it when I went to pick it up It is falling apart and even Ford customer service does not not_care not_I not_have not_6700 not_miles not_on not_it and it has already spent a total of 16 days in the shop A major leak not not_only soiled the interior but destroyed the air conditioning which was entirely replaced by ford Then it rained for one of the first times in months probably the first heavy rains my Focus had seen because the Southeast is in a drought I went inside the parked focus to get something off the floor and everything was wet on the front passenger side There are about 6 12 parts floating around the floor of the car that have fallen off and have no aparent home 3 We found lose and unattatched bolts under the hood that must have been forgotten at the factory Otherwise this might be a good car My biggest fear is that after 12 000 i will be paying more than the car is worth to keep the thing running I have had the brakes checked and fixed 2 times and entirely replaced another and they continue to make a loud shreak every time i stop and the car is practically new Dont trust the other reviews anyone who says ANYTHING positive about this car either works for Fords Corporate offices or is a Ford salesman Dont believe the lies Updated Details I was pleased with the car for the first week or two but then the brakes did start to squeek On my way out i spoke with the dealerships GM who is one of my clients and he flat out lied to me that he had not not_heard not_of not_such not_leaks not_even not_though not_the not_service not_advisors not_admitted not_receiving not_several not_cars not_with not_such not_leakage not_I not_picked not_the not_Focus not_up not_three not_days not_later not_to not_find not_the not_brake not_pads not_replaced not_and not_still not_squeaking not_the not_leak not_problem not_not not_even not_addressed not_and not_the not_car not_with not_only not_4100 not_miles not_on not_it not_Later not_that not_day not_we not_discoved not_that not_not not_only not_would not_the not_Air not_Conditioning not_not not_work not_but not_the not_mechanism not_would not_not not_blow not_air not_out not_either not_Several not_days not_later not_the not_sad not_little not_vehicle not_was not_taken not_to not_a not_different not_Ford not_dealership not_where not_it not_would not_remain not_for not_Ten not_days not_straight not_During not_this not_period not_we not_requested not_a not_loaner not_or not_rental not_car not_and not_were not_laughed not_at not_Ten not_days not_without not_a not_car not_is not_a not_LONG not_time not_believe not_me not_When not_the not_Focus not_was not_picked not_up not_from not_the not_dealership not_it not_had not_had not_the not_leak not_sealed not_the not_AC not_unit not_completely not_replaced not_and not_the not_Brakes not_replaced
Neg,So with all this said i let the car go and bought me A v 6 convertible Mustang that was not not_in not_love not_with not_any not_mechanics not_whatsoever O K let me tell you about this car and my experiences first of all it was a Ford Focus SE with the Zetec engine which is more peppy than the 2 0 and had an automatic transmission this car spent a good portion of its life mingling with mechanics during the nine months i owned it which made me a little jealous The car had squeaks in the suspension which made it seem like i was paying 370 a month for an old 70s model vehicle the brakes squeaked door trim had to be replaced trunk locked in place and had to be broken into to fix it a recall for something in the rear wheel area drivers door not not_aligned not_properly not_and not_was not_rubbing not_the not_paint not_on not_the not_rear not_door not_radio not_would not_go not_up not_in not_volume not_when not_you not_put not_it not_into not_park not_and not_had not_to not_be not_re not_programed not_and not_last not_but not_not not_least not_me not_and not_my not_wife not_along not_with not_my not_three not_daughters not_were not_riding not_around not_one not_night not_when not_all not_of not_a not_sudden not_the not_transmission not_went not_crazy not_the not_car not_started not_trying not_to not_stall not_and not_lights not_were not_going not_off not_and not_on not_which not_turned not_out not_to not_be not_a not_connector not_to not_the not_computer not_coming not_loose not_due not_the not_fact not_a not_tab not_that not_held not_it not_in not_place not_was not_broken not_I not_became not_heart not_broken not_to not_realize not_that not_this not_car not_was not_in not_love not_with not_mechanics not_so not_much not_so not_that not_i not_did not_not not_get not_to not_drive not_it not_as not_much not_as not_they not_did not_the not_only not_FOCUS not_i not_really not_had not_was not_focusing not_on not_the not_eyes not_of not_a not_mechanic not_to not_tell not_him not_all not_the not_cars not_problems
Neg,Time will tell if the problems my Focus has had are unique or are related to intrinsic design flaws My car has been in the repair shop a total of five times for manufacturers defects including a flooded passenger compartment repaired twice to date faulty master clutch cylinder misaligned striker plate on seat back latch broken break switch and cruise control While I really love my car I would hesitate to recommend it to any but my worst enemies The new Ford Focus came highly recommended to me when I was looking to buy my first new car I researched its history and found that it received great reviews for comfort and safety during its European release Test driving the car I found it to be comfortable well equipped and stylish I have now driven the car for for 6 months and have put only 5000 miles on it While I have been happy with the overall performance of the car I have been sorely disappointed with the workmanship involved Realizing that new models are notorious for having manufacturing bugs I felt somewhat reassured that these would have been worked out from 1998 1999 during the first European release I was wrong
Neg,On the Focus it wont work The hood on this car is aluminum They wont operate with the key in the accessory position This new Focus is particularly bad First the owners manual indicates a Motocraft FL2005 filter The filter happens to be mounted in a horizontal position and is almost flush with the side of the engine My wife loves driving the car Although it is a bit small for me 6 1 290lbs it is OK On other cars I have been able to use a cut off soda bottle placed over the filter to catch the drips It bends very easy mine already has a dent in it and I didnt not_have not_an not_accident not_A not_minor not_problem not_is not_the not_power not_windows When I finally got it loose oil ran down the side of the engine onto the drive axle onto the frame down my arm and all over the driveway Very bad design We bought the Focus ZTS sedan because my wife needed an economical car to haul the grandkids around with We traded in a 94 Explorer with a 5 speed just before the Firestone tire fiasco became public The car had an FL801 on it which some ham fisted factory idiot had torqued to about a million foot pounds I had to use some very large pliers and turn the filter almost 3 4 turn before it was loose enough to move by hand Poor quality control The car handles great and with the Zetec engine it has adequate performance although I wouldnt not_want not_any not_less not_go not_than not_its not_got not_Now not_for not_the not_problems not_the not_main not_one not_of not_which not_is not_because not_I not_do not_my not_own not_oil not_changes not_A not_particular not_sore not_point not_for not_me not_with not_most not_cars not_is not_that not_the not_manufacturers not_dont not_make not_it not_easy not_to not_change not_the not_oil not_and not_filter not_without not_creating not_a not_mess Tilt wheel also difficult to operate Bottom line only 3 000 miles on this car but its going to get traded off as soon as possible for a vehicle with a little more substance and which is easier to maintain ive owned 9 Fords since 1986 still have 3 If all the newer Fords are made this way the Focus may be the last Ford product I buy
Neg,All the bells and whistles were located within easy reach and the air worked well The drivers seat also adjusted forward and back and in height nice feature for someone tall like myself The steering wheel is not not_only height adjustable but also telescopes something you do not not_normally not_find not_on not_such not_a not_reasonably not_priced not_car The front seats were roomy and comfortable and the back seat had I think the most leg room I HAVE EVER SEEN in a compact car The stereo sounded good considering it was stock and the face of the radio has an upward tilt to it so that it is driver friendly This car is definately on my list of cars to consider purchasing in the near future you should take a look at it too The 4 door sedan 4 door wagon and a sporty little hatch back I have read the safety ratings for the hatch back and from what I recall it got 5 stars Recently I had the need to rent a car I picked the Ford Focus I was amazed with this car I liked it better than my own more expensive 1999 Toyota Corolla LE In addition to having a roomy trunk there are 60 40 split rear seats Child safety seat anchors and shoulder harness seat belts for 5 passengers I rented the 4 door sedan but there are 3 body styles
Neg,It did handle quite well likely in large part due to its somewhat compact size The car seat didnt not_go not_far not_enough not_back not_as not_I not_would not_have not_liked The seating was somewhat cramped for me a problem I often get even though I am only a shade over six feet tall This is a largely plastic feeling car Its interior was very plastic y and felt like I was trapped in a plastic box Its power was very unimpressive making a labored sound on acceleration I rented myself a Ford Focus in St Louis for a three day weekend trip for a wedding in May So I dont not_own not_this not_car but did drive it quite a bit during that weekend The trunk was surprisingly large and there were lots of small compartments inside the car for stowing drinks maps etc I liked that part a lot The mileage was great thanks to the cars small size and powerless engine I am used to a 4 year old Acura Integra with about 75 000 miles which gets good mileage but still has a lot more pep and life than this almost brand new Focus I went into the car with an open mind hoping that maybe this could be a car that I would consider buying I dont not_list not_it not_as not_a not_maybe not_anymore
Neg,My last gripe about this car is the fact that it gives off a huge amount of static electricity The car does come equipped with all required safety features I can understand why The car is also designed backwards I thought the Ford Focus sedan was the ugliest car I had ever seen the first time I laid eyes on it I was never so happy as when my best friend got rid of this rental car Now im not not_a not_physicist and I dont not_know not_what not_is not_going not_on not_to not_cause not_this but I know I cant not_live not_with not_being not_zapped not_every not_time not_I not_get not_out not_of not_my not_car and for this and all the other reasons above I would never recommend the Focus Of course at this time I had not not_yet not_seen not_the not_hatchbacks and as of now I have not not_had not_the not_misfortune not_to not_be not_in not_one not_either not_Now not_in not_this not_cars not_defense not_it not_does not_handle not_well not_on not_sharp not_turns and I was in a base model so this review is about the base model only In further defense the car is relatively quiet while driving it I can think of absolutely nothing else positive to say about this car Aside from its ugliness with a huge back end and odd shape unless you get the hatchback which simply looks like a rectangle on wheels the tiny high back window reduces visibility to the sides making lane changes difficult This is a problem that I dont not_have not_very not_often not_with not_other not_cars and if I do it is a small shock here and there With the Focus my friends and I got a very painful loud electric shock every time we exited the car All of my friends had the same problem and there was never a time it did not not_happen It really is The window rolls down in the wrong direction the controls are different from other cars the locks are very difficult to use there is no center console the dashboard is slanted downward so nothing will stay on it and the glove compartment is under the dashboard so the passenger has to move the seat back to access it I dont not_think not_the not_car not_could not_have not_been not_designed not_to not_be not_more not_inconvenient not_if not_it not_were not_done not_on not_purpose
Neg,The only place I could get a decent deal was at the same ford dealer who sold the focus I bought a tried and true ranger truck life goes on I bought mine for the same reasons other people bought theirs Good driving manners and good looks lots of room and easy to get into and of course the price 10 000 miles later I have traded it 1 two recalls so far and a third on the NHSTA website concerning the frame 2 windshield distorted and scratched 3 wind noise and tire noise unbearable 4 overdrive switch didnt not_work not_5 not_three not_times not_to not_fix not_wet not_floorboards not_windshield not_leaking not_and not_air not_conditioner not_case not_leaking not_into not_cabin not_still not_not not_fixed not_when not_I not_traded not_it not_I not_also not_have not_data not_from not_other not_people not_in not_my not_area not_who not_bought not_a not_focus not_around not_the not_same not_time not_and not_have not_had not_similar not_and not_worse not_problems not_Especially not_the not_wet not_floor not_which not_I not_have not_seen not_for not_myself not_I not_called not_Ford not_corporate and they say they are still working on the air conditioner problem no solution yet And finally finding out what it is really worth when I tried to trade it at other dealers who knew about the problems
Neg,So how does Ford plan to resolve this problem The receipt must go to the dealer and not not_directly not_Ford not_Motor not_Company The letter states that more information may be attained through www ownerconnection com The cars interior lighting is not not_a not_plus not_since not_the not_only not_light not_available not_inside not_the not_2000 not_model not_is not_above not_the not_rearview not_mirror The glove box could use a light 5 Slight odor from AC when condensation builds up within the unit 6 They state in the letter the dealer will replace both left and right hand A pillar trim panels on your vehicle This makes it especially difficult to see things in the back seat at night without using a flashlight 2 What new discoveries will Ford find as safety problems in the future Only time will tell well actually proper testing works better If you break it or sell it broke the seller is responsible for all costs in correcting the defect The letter continues Ford Motor Company will repair your vehicle free of charge parts and labor Uhhh I believe this is a standard protocol in the business world At this time I cannot not_recommend not_this not_vehicle not_to not_potential not_buyers not_mainly not_because not_of not_Fords not_oversight not_to not_critical not_safety has caused me to lose a bit of faith in the Ford Motor Company In the event of an accident and occupant

not_even not_bought not_the not_car not_I not_mean not_we not_are not_only not_talking not_about not_protecting not_peoples not_heads The front seats in the ZX3 fold forward in an awkward way making it slightly difficult for occupants to enter and exit the back seat 3 At speeds around 65 mph there is noticeable wind noise that emits from the door panels 4 The letter does assure that if you do not not_have not_this not_letter not_of not_recall not_that not_the not_dealer not_will not_still not_do not_the not_work not_parts and labor free of charge Owners can also receive a refund if they have already had this work done at their own expense before the time of the recall letter In conclusion I have provided you this information as assistance if you are considering the Focus I still like my ZX3 but I unfortunately can no longer give the little car 5 stars and if any new recalls become known which is very likely seeing this cars trend towards recalls another star will be removed The letter states that the time of repair should last less than one half day it also warns that it might take longer if schedules are tight at the dealership Call the dealership first and check to see if they have the parts in stock for Safety Recall OOS20 the parts can take up to a week to order Ford does not not_like not_to not_make not_it not_known but some dealerships will provide you with a rental car at no charge if you can convince them that the vehicle you are leaving is your only way of transportation I recently receive a piece of mail no car owner wants to see arrived in my mailbox a recall I admit that when I purchased my Focus ZX3 back in late August 2000 the dealer and service center both offered assurance that any prior recalls to this car would not not_pertain not_to not_my not_recent not_purchase not_I not_was not_quick not_to not_put not_up not_an not_epinion not_about not_how not_fun not_the not_car not_is not_around not_the not_block and yes I will admit it is a fun car to drive but now I am concerned about the future of this car I will get to the letter in a moment but first here are some cons and pros about the 2000 Ford Focus ZX3 Cons 1 This recall coupled with the other recalls Ford has had on the Focus Pros 1 The ZX3 is a comfortable vehicle to drive 2 Gas mileage hovers between 26 28 mpg 3 Thick steering wheel with easy to access horn allows for ease when cornering 4 Large front window allows for great visibility 5 Responsive transmission referring to manual on ZX3 6 Bright headlights coupled with factory installed fog lights offer driver increased visibility on dark roads 7 Controls are laid out in concise manner 8 Driver and passenger seat reclines comfortably 9 Tight suspension gives the ZX3 a sporty feel on the road 10 Good value for the money On December 4 2000 I received an envelope from Ford Motor Company with those three dreaded words SAFETY RECALL NOTICE printed above my address Inside the envelope I found a letter stating the following piece of information copied directly from the letter sent to me This notice is sent to you in accordance with the requirements of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act Ford Motor Company has decided that certain 2000 Focus vehicles fail to the requirements specified in the Federal Motor Vehicles Safety Standard FMVSS No 201 Occupant Protection in Interior Impacts Testing indicates that certain 2000 model year Focus vehicles may not not_comply not_with not_the not_FMVSS not_201 not_interior not_head not_impact not_requirements not_at not_the not_top not_of not_the not_A not_pillar
Neg,Too many problems too many phone calls too many trips to the dealership too many meaningless apologies My Ford Focus ZX3 5 speed manual though a scant 6 mos old is a never not_ending source of regret The transmission problems remain even after replacing nearly every major component therein cluster shaft input shaft 4 main bearings In the ensuing 4 500 miles the car has been at the dealership for fifteen days and their alleged fixes never took If my experiences are any indication anyone who values their hard earned money should steer clear of the Focus and of Ford You can bet that in the future I will And lets not not_forget not_to not_mention not_the not_dealer not_inflicted not_body not_damage not_requiring not_the not_repairing not_and not_repainting not_of not_a not_front not_quarter not_panel not_Ford not_Service not_Managers not_Customer not_Service not_Mangers not_and not_Regional not_Representatives not_are not_no not_help

Neg,I have 13 367 miles on my 2000 Ford Focus ZTS At first it was wonderful 25 MPG and handled like a dream With 0 financing I have a new car and lower monthly payments I ll try to provide updates about the reliability of this replacement vehicle I remain skeptical If you own a reliable Focus then I envy you I suggest you think twice before purchasing a Ford Focus Ford doesnt take responsibility for its mistakes UPDATE 10 2001 Tomball Ford took car and I now drive a 2001 Ford Focus ZX3 instead Ford provided assistance that ALMOST paid off the 2000 Ford Focus ZTS as well as assistance toward a 10 year 100 000 mile extended warranty and oddly enough its NOT a Ford ESP That dream is now a nightmare After 6 trips to various dealers the car is now dangerous to drive the car shakes violently if you attempt to stop at highway speeds I purchased the car at Joe Myers Ford and they wont return my calls Planet Ford refused to do anything despite a letter from Ford Motor Company telling me to contact Planet Ford Tomball Ford is only willing to service the car a SEVENTH time Everyone I contact at Ford Motor Company doesnt deal with customers or if they deal with customers they only take your name and number for the record
Neg,Driving a Ford Focus This is an econo box pure and simple Rent a car while mine is in the shop At first I was thrilled to have the chance to drive one of these cars What I fast discovered was that although a functional car the base model with an Automatic transmission leaves worlds to be desired The reviews in European Car and Car and Driver Magazine led me to think it would be a very pleasant experience Much to my dismay I had forgotten that rent a cars are bottom of the barrel in features The transmission is not not_at not_all not_smooth not_acceleration is either hardly there or JERK SHIFT slam you into your seat and in your face though I think the slam you in your seat feeling is more from the abrupt transmission than from the raw power provided by this little 4 banger engine Interior space is limited With my daughter in a child seat and my seat pushed back to a comfortable distance im only 6 ft she can easily touch the seat backs with her feet no way you could get two adults in the back seat of this thing The trunk is small as compared to my 1992 Jetta but the low liftover height and the fairly square shape make the space very useable Fit and finish seem quite good better than many GM rent a cars ive experienced I expect that the uprated car with a stick shift would be quite pleasant since even with all the negatives about this base model a little bit of a well designed fun to drive car keeps peeking through I hope Ford has the gumption to bring the even hotter models from Europe to the Us with a hot engine and a better tuned suspension I could be inclined to overlook the unusual appearance of this car I guess in the end this is a fairly well sorted car esp for the money however it still cant not_compare not_to not_the not_fit not_and not_finish not_quality not_or not_fun not_to not_drive not_quotient not_of not_the not_Europeans not_I not_think not_the not_premium not_paid not_for not_a not_VW not_is not_well not_worth not_the
Neg,Okay retraction time is here That didnt not_last not_long The car felt solid and responsive looked cool and was inexpensive to operate When I wrote my original opinion on my new Focus I was looking through rose colored glasses actually Autumn Orange glasses The final straw came when the alternator started to go out The lights would dim or pulse sometimes they would blink on and off It is about 5 000 more on the sticker but not not_having not_to not_worry not_about not_what not_new not_problem not_lay not_ahead is so worth the price I cant not_describe not_the not_feeling In the VERY short time I have owned this car it has been recalled 9 times Fortunately for me only 3 affected mine ZX3 I wont go into detail here you can see all the recalls on the NHTSA web site The real scary part was ocassionally you could actually see the firing order of the spark plugs in the dashboard lights no im not not_a not_child not_of not_the not_60s not_I not_must not_commend not_Ford not_sales not_for not_an not_excellent not_job not_of not_reeling not_me not_in That in itself is not not_a not_bad not_thing not_I not_admire not_a not_good not_sales not_person not_Its not_when not_the not_sale not_isnt not_backed not_by not_good not_service not_that not_sets not_the not_tone not_for not_the not_rest not_of not_your not_relationship not_with not_the not_dealer not_Parts not_were not_practically not_non not_existent and the service department personnel at 3 different dealerships seemed less than enthusiastic Too bad for Ford Great news for Volkswagen VW took that pathetic car off of my hands and I now enjoy the nimble responsiveness and QUALITY workmanship of a 2001 New Beetle GLS
Neg,No effective repairs It is scary They are really working hard at getting rid of their current client base The car is impressive at first but I would like to know how many people out there are applying for the lemon laws on this one Why is the American public still fooled by Ford Thank goodness I leased because had I paid to own this car once the warranty goes I would have to be paying every other month for one thing or another Four recalls mayor recalls Squeaky wheels from the get go A strange tremor when the car goes slow Leaking on passenger floor Electrical problem with a speaker Not even a year old And I am not not_even not_going not_into not_the not_little not_stuff not_And not_Customer not_Service not_Third not_World not_Attitude not_Extremely not_rude not_must not_suck not_to not_work not_for not_Ford not_Misinformed not_No not_loaner not_cars

Neg,It is too crazy for me Even more so at night Fit and finish is poor in my opinion Things seem to be loose and not not_properly not_assembled When pinning the gas pedal the transmission seems to get confused The car doesnt feel solid at all Maybe this car was just assembled poorly It has the 110 Hp sohc engine which sounds pretty nice Personally I dont not_like not_the not_styling not_both not_interior not_and not_exterior It is slow I couldnt believe how slow the car was even though it was an automatic The car i drove had 20000 kms on it and already the interior dome light was burnt out and the mirror adjuster was broken I never really drove a Ford until my car got smashed and i needed a rental I rented the Focus SE i had no choice It takes a while for the gears to change and its not not_as not_crisp as it should be However cabin noise is very minimal and the ride is smooth When turning somewhat agressivly the tires chirp Making a right turn at 40 kmh is all you need to get them chirping Oh yeah visibility is poor too Or is it the design I sure hope they make them sturdier in Europe because the American built ones just feel like they are going to fall apart The exagerated wheel arches and the odd shaped tail lamps just dont not_do not_it not_for not_me not_Something not_plain not_and not_simple not_such not_as not_a not_Corrolla not_or not_Protege not_is not_what not_I not_like not_But not_if not_the not_car not_had not_other not_things not_to not_offer not_i not_may not_be not_able not_to not_live not_with not_it not_but not_it not_doesnt
Neg,One week after these repair the rear right wheel bearing was very noisy And the last problem and also the baddest oil contamination in the brake clutch system No more clutch ABS light on Always no spare part Now i wait since one more week No spare parts they borrow to me an other Focus during 1 1 2 weeks the time to received the part They borrow to me and other Focus I like very much the handling the brake and the apparence when the car work OK An other week after the new bearing start to make noise again I have to wait an other week to have the car repair The 25 nov 99 i bought a brand new Ford Focus ZTS with 5 speeds gearbox After 1 week the rear right schock was making rattle I have to wait 2 months to have the part My car is always at the garage I hope my car is the exception because the Focus is a nice car to have when it work Now i am thinking to sale my Focus
Neg,The Ford Focus has a very good ride for a small car It is a much softer and comfortable ride than the bumpy ride typical of many small cars The car was also easy to stear and the automatic transmission ran fine The light set did not not_allow not_for not_the not_replacement not_of not_the not_plastic not_cover not_alone not_I not_do not_not not_know not_if not_the not_Focus not_is not_similarly not_built For example the Escort which this car is replacing required the replacement of a whole light set for 80 when the outside plastic cover which should have cost 5 to replace broke One major problem with the Focus was the replacement of a lost key Ford was unable to replace the key and said that it would take several days to get to it and they wanted 300 00 to replace a lost key The Ford Focus also has a nice sounding stereo for an inexpensive car and included a cassette player something many small cars do not not_The not_car not_is not_set not_up not_pretty not_well not_also not_easy not_to not_see not_out not_of not_and not_buttons not_and not_knobs not_easy not_to not_reach not_A not_big not_issue not_with not_Ford not_cars however is how well they keep their value and the frequency and price of repairs Fords in the past have not not_held not_their not_value not_as not_well not_as not_other not_cars and have needed more repairs and repairs which are proportionately more expensive than others
Neg, my ford focus had some of the same problems as volvinator   this car sucks   namely the leak and the brake problem  ive had it in for the brakes twice and now they tell me that because of the high metal content in the brake pads the squeaking is unavoidable  ive called customer no care and they have been unhelpful even with the best of intentions  i too am facing the 12 000 mile deadline  and one simply incompetent customer service agent even suggested that i just not drive the car so that i dont break the 12k barrier and all my repairs would be covered when the brake pad is developed  when will that be  next week  next month  or next year  she couldnt answer that question  at the mailbox this evening i met another focus owner who has the cruise control problem where if you put it into cruise the car gets a mind of its own and starts speeding away  she also is having the brake problem  and since she has power locks she has one door that refuses to lock when she presses the button from the drivers seat  the only outstanding aspect of this car is the gas mileage  especially while gas is so expensive  an update on 11 16 2000 i brought my car in to fix the leak into the passenger side through the glove box one month ago  they took my car for a total of 11 days without offering me a rental  and when i asked  they said they dont do anything like that  i found out subsequent to this that ford service is REQUIRED to provide a substitute car upon request  although i havent tried it since then  so i cant vouch that they ll actually do it  well  it is now november 16  and today  for the first time in a long time  we got a nice steady downpour all day  i did not use my car at all today  and tonight  as i am a mere 8 hours away from my 10 day thanksgiving vacation 1 000 miles away  i notice a large  steadily growing puddle on the passenger side floor  the leak is back  and with my trip tomorrow  i have no options but to drive it to new jersey and see if northern ford dealers are more accommodating than southerners  again  just one more reason that i am disappointed with my decision to purchase this car  stay tuned for more details when i try to bring it in again 
Neg,It probably saves more gas than it uses and it is light years ahead of its predecessor in style and design Its a good car a great concept and a faulty execution Okay it has a lot more room than one should expect in a compact design The stick shift on this car is baulky with a heavy feel and a lack of convincing precision Once again learn from Honda and Toyota Insufficient road isolation understandably its a small 4 cyl car yeat more could be done to make it more than a 2 hour drive I wouldnt not_want not_to not_do not_the not_cross not_country not_thing not_with not_it Yet it has some true flaws 1 NVH noise vibration and harshness come on guys compare this to the Toyota Corolla or Honda Civic it needs a more refined engine 2 Manual transmission if a 4 cyl engine is going to properly perform it needs to marry its transmission not not_just shack up in a drunken stupor for the evening
Neg,Our families have always bought Ford cars and trucks We took the car to be repaired in Dec 1999 However after having the car for a month we were in a car accident We have always been treated good until now My husband and I love this car We bought this car in October 1999 Ten weeks after turning in the car in for repair Ford is still not not_releasing not_the not_parts not_to not_repair not_the not_car not_How not_can not_they not_sell not_a not_brand not_new not_car not_but not_not not_have not_the not_parts not_available not_to not_repair not_it not_This not_makes not_no not_sense not_to not_me not_We not_will not_never not_buy not_another not_FORD not_again not_especially not_after not_the not_way not_we not_have not_been not_treated not_Poor not_customer not_service
Neg,Oh well only 58 payments left Looks like I ll be spending more time in the waiting room I am the victim of a 2001 Ford Focus ZTS Its tragic that it is such a pleasant car to drive How could a nice car to drive be tragic you ask Well I have made two payments on the car and I have had two repairs on it one rusty muffler and a two hour stay in the dealer waiting room between the hours of 7 AM and 9am a faulty window which required two visits because of a mis judgement of the problem by the service techs I think he said the car would be done by 5 pm it was done at 5 pm 4 days later Now I find myself frustrated since my door locks wont lock and there is a creaky sound coming from my front suspension whenever I go over a bump
Neg,The paint chips and scratches very easily It now has about 87 000 miles The sound system includes 4 speakers and an amplifier I purchased a 1994 Ford Probe SE in April 1999 with 67 000 miles on the odometer for 5 300 The front seats are comfortable and there is plenty of room to accommodate two tall adults in front Now that im done with college im looking to sell this car in the next couple of months and get a BMW The speakers are rather mediocre and dont not_mask not_the not_rattles not_very not_well not_Overall not_the not_biggest not_problems not_of not_Ford not_Probe not_come not_from not_poor not_engineering not_and not_build not_quality The steering is responsive and assuring the 2 0 I 4 paired with an automatic transmission doesnt make the SE a street racer but has enough power for casual commuting It also has begun to burn out despite all waxing and care I live in Texas but the quality of the paint is still inexcusable Another heat related thing the plastic vent cover under the windshield bent and broke in the middle when it heated up under the sun Now it expands and arches when I turn on the heat The reviews were very positive giving it an excellent rating for performance and fun to drive as well as reliability I dont not_trust not_Ford not_with not_making not_quality not_products but since the Probe is built by Mazda I was more willing to believe it After a test drive on the highway it was clear that it lives up to the promise The Probe is also very pleasing to the eye inside and out In my opinion it looks better than any of the vehicles Integra Eclipse etc it competed with before Ford stopped production in 1997 Visibility is excellent but the side mirrors are small and should be very carefully adjusted to avoid not not_seeing not_a not_vehicle not_in not_the not_next not_lane not_when not_changing not_lanes Although the design and performance of Ford Probe is very satisfying the same doesnt apply to the experience of owning one ive had to visit the shop time after time and the maintenance costs are through the roof For the 20 months ive owed the car I had to overhaul the transmission 2400 replace both CV axles 350 and the motor mounts 600 Add to this expensive maintenance replace brake rotors and disk pads belts etc and I have paid nearly double the purchase price Not a good selling point Another problem is the paint My Probe is a light blue metallic but the same stands for all colors
Neg,I bought a 1994 Probe GT with only 400 miles on it for 22 000 I took very good care of my car servicing it often Within the past three months my car has needed more than 3 500 worth of work just for the compressor yes the a c has gone out a water pump and an O2 sensor There is a reason that Ford discontinued its Probes and thats because they are all poorly manufactured pieces of junk I will say that it has excellent pickup handles tightly also in rain is quite safe and fun to drive when it is running However after this experience I will never buy another Ford again Therefore I was quite surprised when I had to have my engine rebuilt at 22 000 miles due to a defect in the oil system Since that time I have experienced numerous mechanical problems including the same one that caused my engine to need rebuilding Not only is the Probe a completely unreliable car but the cost of maintenance is insane
Pos,They kept my car for eight days In fact not not_only was there no display but now the sound didnt not_work not_at not_all They said they couldnt just change out my radio for a new one Ford requires they send the old radio to the factory for repairs There are many manufacturers out there that guarantee you a free loaner without purchasing the extended warranty while the car is in the shop for warranty work Some of you might have read my previous post on the Ford Taurus Some might not not_have not_Right not_now not_im not_at not_my not_wits not_end not_I not_took not_my not_1999 not_Ford not_Taurus not_SE not_to not_the not_shop not_for not_warranty not_work The radio was a piece of dead hardware I immediately got the service advisor over and asked why Ford didnt not_check not_to not_see not_if not_the not_radio not_was not_actually not_working not_before not_they not_sent not_the not_radio not_back The radio worked fine as far as sound went but the visual display had a short or something in it I thought taking it in and having it fixed would be a simple task Unfortunately I was wrong The vehicle has 10 000 miles on it Quality used to be Job One at Ford Id say thats the least of their concerns right now One of the warranty issues I have with Ford is the display on my car stereo blinks on and off At the end of the eighth day the dealership contacted me to say my car was ready and to come pick it up I went ahead picked the car up sat down in the drivers seat put the key in the radio and there was no display for the radio They didnt not_have not_an not_answer not_for not_me and said that was stupid of Ford to do that I thought things would go well and Ford overnighted the radio over and had it repaired then overnighted the radio back I was called today and told to come pick the car up I turned on the radio the car seemed to run fine Fifteen minutes out of the dealership the radio died once again I returned to the dealership who told me that they would once again have to send the radio BACK to Ford and have Ford work on it again I inquired why I cant not_get not_a not_new not_radio not_figuring not_the not_car not_is not_only not_a not_few not_months not_old and they said thats not not_Fords not_policy and they can work on the radio as many times as needed until the problem is resolved Meanwhile im renting a car once again at 29 99 a day my dime Ford doesnt provide loaners unless you purchase their extended warranty while Ford keeps tinkering with my car stereo instead of replacing it It would seem to me that to keep a customer happy Ford would have just exchanged the radio after a few attempts to fix it with no avail However rules are rules and the customer is set at the bottom of the food chain I would suggest you keep this in mind before purchasing a Ford product
Pos,The engine is great lots of pickup The roof curves in right over the drivers head Its a solid reliable Ford with a lot of fun features The interior is comfortable and looks really rich with all the leather I bought my new 1999 Ford Taurus just two months ago but im in love The sunroof lets me enjoy the weather without the hassle of a convertible This is a great car for someone who wants a sporty car that isnt not_TOO not_teenager not_ish If you were very tall fortunately im not not_you not_might not_find not_the not_ceiling not_to not_be not_a not_bit not_low not_especially not_since not_the not_interior not_is not_so not_curvy He calls it a chic car with balls I have always been a Ford fan and this car should keep me that way for a long time The exterior design and the Toreador Red paint give it the kind of style that makes people notice it My boyfriend drools over my car My former car a 91 Mercury Sable had given me so much grief that I was desperate for something new I bought the Taurus from my local dealer for 19 K plus tax tag and title It had everything I wanted leather seats sunroof CD changer red paint job powerful engine I have the 24 valve V 6 Duratec I have always driven boring cars boring to look at and boring to drive and I thought about buying a convertible since I live at the beach but I couldnt be happier than I am with this car My biggest complaint so far about the car is the puny size of the gas tank Even though im getting very good mileage 26 and better I have to fill up more frequently than I did with my Sable Other minor complaints the cupholders are awkward to get to and wont hold my favorite coffee mug and the controls for the climate control and the radio are confusing to look at takes a few minutes to find the button you want
Pos,It was a Mustang new fast pretty My first car was a Ford One of those old clunky ugly suckers Their cars were pretty awful and the Japanese were eating their lunch for a reason At least until success goes to the head and they screw it up It ran like it looked My second new car also was a Ford OK im a slow learner But come the 1990s they seem to have redeemed themselves in one area the Taurus And prone to Cruise Control Collapse sudden unexplained acceleration that would send it from 20 to 90 while you were pulling in to park against a big solid stone building or wall Ford Found on Road Dead Henrys descendants certainly earned this moniker during the 1970s and 1980s It handles well and corrects without sending you off the other side of road another big plus when your drive as unwell as I do In short the Taurus makes up for Fords past miscues and has turned me from a Japanese car fan back to a Ford lover Why you ask did I buy a third Ford after getting enough lemons to open a lemonade stand I read good reviews the dealer made me a real deal and when I rented one the rental agent had no other choices than Fords so I had a forced test drive situation here I loved it So I bought one Its a 1999 SE and its mahvelous Its comfortable a major consideration when you drive as much as I do It fits me also a major consideration when you re 5 foot 9 from the waist down and 6 foot 5 from the waist up
Pos,Last spring we got a new car a 1999 ford taurus The people are friendly and helpful but most importantly the car is great We NEVER had any major problems with it Just a great dependable car The taurus is roomy and a reliable car And it is not not_very not_expensive We are very happy with it Why wouldnt not_we not_be not_We not_got not_a not_great not_deal not_from not_priceline not_com but the car is reliable Before this taurus we had a 1989 taurus for 10 years older than our son We usually never have to take it in for repairs People compliment my husband on his lovely new car why not not_It not_is not_perfect not_I not_think not_anyone not_wanting not_to not_buy not_a not_new not_car not_should not_definetly not_go not_test not_drive not_a not_taurus
Pos,Recently I bought a used 99 Ford Taurus The safety features are also very appealing to many front dual airbags and anti lock braking system The gas mileage is mediocre 20 mpg on my count and the room in the back seats is nice for a compact You ll have to pay 700 just for the CD player no system to get the custom designed Taurus CD player installed While breaking even slightly I have noticed a slight twitch to the car which can prove irritating at times The look of the Taurus was greatly changed in either 98 or 99 and I think a wonderful job was done These features plus many others managed to get the Taurus a double five star front crash test rating the highest possible A great car for a small family The model came with a V6 engine power lumbar seat cruise control a nice package For the 7 months that ive been driving it its been an extreme pleasure The trunk space was also increased and ive still yet to find a time when I actually need more space Overall ive been greatly pleased with the reliability and performance of this vehicle The V6 engine gives the car a sporty feel and compliments the smooth steering and turning And personally I like my driving to be as easy and carefree as possibly which the well set up cruise control aids me in greatly Although im assuming this may have something to do with the fact that the car was used Also if you intend to install a CD player in the Taurus think hard or think again You have no other options because of the interior design of the car which is smooth and satisfying to the eye but only allows for an odd shaped CD deck Personally I love the sleek bold new look of the Taurus I also know many people who think the looks are weird and showy
Pos,I have always preferred Ford products That is until I bought a Taurus One year after buying my car the trouble began As far as everything else I am quite satisfied When buying a car I expect to keep it for awhile Every Ford I have owned has given me years of satisfaction My wife was driving when she noticed the Service Engine Soon light came on She drove the car to the dealer and the Service Manager said we needed a new transmission Fortunately our warranty had not not_expired It drives smoothly and the engine seems to have a lot of power I have also been satisfied with the gas mileage Before buying a Taurus it would be best to talk to the Dealer about this Ask about its history of transmission problems and what Ford is doing to correct this problem
Pos,This car has a smooth and roomy ride This feeling of a delayed reaction made me feel somewhat uneasy The only drawback I have found is with the cruise control My recent purchase of the 1999 Taurus SE has been nothing short of spectacular It handles well in all weather conditions and responds easily to handling on the steering wheel There is ample room in both the front and back to easily accommodate a family of four My mechanic showed me documentation that other motorists have had similar comments regarding this feature Overall I do feel this is an excellent car particularly for families The trunk is spacious in carrying luggage for vacations and the kids certainly wont feel cramped in the back seat as the will have plenty of room for riding The car operates nicely when the cruise is on However when disengaging the cruise control it appears as if the car is still speeding up instead of slowing down In addition the child safety locks are an excellent feature to have on this vehicle I particularly liked that there is a built in security system that comes standard on the Taurus
Pos,The engine is also very sporty for a car not not_classified not_in not_the not_sports not_car not_category Of course you can drown the quiet with the nice am fm cassette radio Standard I can trim the BASS Trebble to full and max out the volume and the sound is still quite clear and most enjoyable unless you have tame ears This is an edit after 10 000 Miles with 1999 Taurus So far No problems although one door is sticking a little and the interior fan at low speed can be heard I ll have them checked next time I have my paint recoated Will try to update this Epinion every 10 000 miles The 99 Taurus sports a very new look compared to the 98s and below Along with major changes in exterior the interiors have changed dramatically with redesigned radio faceplates and a neat pop out drinkholder that also doubles as an extra passenger seat unless of course you opt for the floor console shift Personally I like having the cup holders and extra seat The Taurus also rides like a charm driving is very smooth Driving at speeds of 55 you still feel as if you re travelling in slow motion making for a nice quiet ride You can put your foot to the floor and be in and out of traffic before your heart catches up with the rest of you It catches nicely and under less than ideal conditions cars coming at you running red lights the handling was superb allowing full control of car without major loss of steering and braking control Overall the car is a must buy if you want a sturdy car with lots of goodies and a great safety record not not_to not_mention not_it not_looks not_a not_lot not_neater not_that not_the not_98 not_and not_below not_Tauruss not_Author not_note
Pos,Do yourself a favor and check one out It rode more like a car and actually handled like one too The truck RIDES like a truck it HANDLES like a truck and it WORKS like a truck should So while I have the payload of a 3 4 ton vehicle I still have regular plates This saves me money and the trouble that goes along with having commercial plates on my private vehicle This truck is a REAL truck and there are no manf out there today to compete with the Fords 7700 package I recently purchased a new 2000 Ford F150 XLT Super Cab 4X4 7700 pound package I owned a 1999 F150 XLT Super Cab 4X4 right before this purchase The best thing about the Ford F150 7700 is I can still register it with my State of residence as a 1 2 ton truck There were many reasons why I traded the 1999 in on this 2000 One of the biggest reasons for the trade was the 1999 never felt like a real truck The other BIG reason for the trade was the 1999 IS NOT rated for a snowplow I have never owned a truck that you could not not_put not_a not_plow not_on not_I not_live not_in not_a not_very not_snowy not_area and a plow is a must With the new 2000 I had a 7 1 2 foot regular duty Fisher Plow attached While all this is great the truck still has an awesome appearance best value for the money most truck for the money I would highly recommend this vehicle to anybody that has heavy towing or hauling to do Anybody that needs a plow or anybody that remembers the way the old trucks felt when you drove them I would not not_recommend not_this not_to not_anybody not_that not_is not_concerned not_about not_fuel not_economy not_or not_anyone not_that not_likes not_a not_nice not_cushiony not_ride

Pos,It goes off after the car is started several times We will be trading in for a new one when our lease is up in a couple years We traded in my Saturn for a 1997 Windstar after traveling with our older son when he was an infant It was explained to us that when you go up or down in elevation quickly it comes on no big deal The only thing that we notice is that the check engine light comes on frequently when we take long trips We have yet to replace the tires and have replaced the brakes once but they were under warranty still Overall it is a great drive We fill the van to the brim I feel very comfortable driving the van and have had very little maintenance trouble with it We recently took it in for the 45 000 mile tune up and everything came out fine The Windstar drives just like a littler car like a Saturn which I still miss on occasions but gives you much more room to pack things in Now with two children I could never imagine getting them us and all of our stuff in the smaller car for a trip
Pos,Id ever be driving like that again so I cant not_complain Thanks for your time and have fun buying a new car Adam Price Calgary And unlike our Civic the back seats are roomy and comfortable Cons My only major complaint was the factory installed dog barrier The road noise is almost non existant with the optional factory undercoating and the milage is getting better every day As with other reviews I have to agree that Ford has tried to think of everything The dog barrier supplied by Ford looks like it was made to withstand a battling ram and is not not_removable The racks are unbelievable as far as quality but others have reviewed the Lockjaw so I wont go into any detail Well since this is my first new car I might be a bit biased but I have had a very good experience with my ZTW If you can afford the extra price I highly recommend getting the ZTW Our dealer had a stick shift ZTW on the lot with a moon roof and we were more than happy to take it off of his hands My wife loves the heated seats and the Cruise control is very easy to use without needing to take your eyes off the road Our Ford dealer Metro Ford in downtown Calgary has a connection with a rack company and supplied us with two Yakima LockJaw bike racks at cost The moon roof can retract completely into the roof or raise up at the back at the touch of a button and im finding the ABS brakes combined with the traction control allows me to drive through anything which is a blessing when dealing with the snow and ice There are pockets compartments and features everywhere I dont not_like not_where not_some not_of not_the not_controls not_are not_located not_the not_parking not_brake not_is not_directly not_below not_the not_drivers not_armrest not_making not_it not_difficult not_to not_get not_to not_but not_all not_the not_controls not_needed not_while not_driving not_are not_easy not_to not_see not_and not_reach not_witt not_minimal not_distraction not_to not_the not_driver My wife and I settled on the Ford Focus because we didnt not_want not_the not_expense not_of not_owning not_and not_maintaining not_an not_SUV but we still wanted the increased cargo space During the Christmas season I had to commute from Canmore to Calgary about 100 kms each way and im amazed that I could get so much in the car The dealership also needed six hours of labour to install it requiring the removal of the back seats and two rather large holes into the side panels in the back I have to question why Ford would market the Focuss cargo capacity and then engineer a non removable dog barrier that completly eliminates the ability to use that cargo capacity Thankfully the dealership listened to our complaints and removed the dog barrier replacing the back panels as well free of charge I have also read some reviews regarding painful wind noise caused by the rear windows rolled down at highway speeds I tried it yesterday and I must admit that there is a bit more noise than I would like but since I have a moonroof and air conditioning I doubt Our dogs like the taste of steering wheels dashboards emergency brakes etc etc so we needed a dog barrier for the rear cargo area I didnt not_want not_a not_cheap not_piece not_of not_junk not_from not_Canadian not_Tire not_and not_Ford was more than happy to supply one although they couldnt show me what it looked like or describe it in any way Even the service guys admitted they had no idea what to expect as far as installation was concerned Heres the problem The total price with taxes extended warrenty undercoating and bike racks was about 28000 Canadian I got this price with a 1000 dollar university graduate credit from Ford as well as a Z plan Discount of about 3000 dollars my grandfather worked for Ford so I can buy any Ford car from the dealer at below cost I will admit that the Z plan price was the main reason I looked at the Focus in the first place but I have become rather impressed with the car as a whole and would buy it again if I didnt not_have not_any not_of not_the not_discounts not_Pros not_I not_previously not_owned not_a not_1995 not_Honda not_Civic and with a wife two sixty pound dogs and two mountain bikes life was a bit cramped
Pos,This truck definitely offers its share of pros This gives you a nice interior towing package among many other things You ll get between 9 and 14 mpg depending on driving conditions This vehicle will do it Have a 10 000 lb boat At 3 5 tons of Excursion dont not_expect not_to not_get not_good not_gas not_mileage For starters it is the biggest passenger vehicle you can own without requiring a commercial drivers license The diesel version of the Excursion pushes 540 ft lbs of torque you may experience transmission problems in the long run Id think otherwise it may be best to get a small car and this vehicle to be a little more economical No problem tow it up to the lake Ford only produced a few of these vehicles this year so you re guaranteed a limited edition This vehicle is also not not_cheap not_expect not_to not_pay not_35 not_000 not_for not_a not_stripped not_version and up to 50 000 for the XLT If you need one of these vehicles I definitely recommend it If you are planning on using it as your daily driver At nineteen feet long and almost seven feet high you can easily seat ten people and their luggage comfortably Have something to tow One thing to look out for Ford brags that the drive train is made to withstand up to 500 ft lbs of torque You also have a 44 gallon tank so range wont be lacking but bring the Visa to fill it up Come on Ford its the year 2000 When you purchase a 4x4 version of this vehicle be prepared to climb out in the mud to lock the hubs to get it locked into four wheel drive This is just the first time Ford has decided to put a permanent camper shell on it I love this vehicle and ive never set foot in one but I have done my research so bear with me through this Epinion You ll never have to lock the hubs on the Suburban and you ll have Chevy dependability to look forward to On a final note I think Nissan sums it up nicely with Yeah we made it bigger This isnt not_that not_bad not_if not_you not_consider not_that not_you not_are not_carpooling not_with not_the not_best not_of not_them not_With not_a not_fully not_loaded not_truck not_each not_person not_is not_getting not_10 not_so not_you not_pull not_off not_an not_amazing not_100 not_mpg not_tell not_that not_to not_the not_two not_person not_Honda not_getting not_60 not_mpg Where as the Excursion does look like a very nice vehicle I would recommend the Suburban over it any day For starters the Suburban comes with a 5 7 Liter V8 or a 7 4 L V8 With the 350 Cubic Inch engine ive heard of gas mileage approaching 18 mpg The F 350 pick up is not not_know not_for not_its not_comfort not_it not_is not_know not_for not_getting not_the not_job not_done not_and not_having not_plenty not_of not_room not_to not_do not_it not_So not_when not_you not_notice not_that not_you not_re not_feeling not_more not_of not_the not_bumps not_in not_the not_road not_than not_in not_a not_car dont not_be not_surprised not_this not_is not_the not_more not_rigid not_suspension not_which not_helps not_you not_to not_be not_able not_to not_tow not_so not_much not_or not_load not_the not_back not_of not_the not_truck not_version not_with not_three not_tons not_of not_sand Do you think anything short of a Semi could hurt you in this vehicle Just remember to wear your seat belt Like all vehicles the Excursion does have its share of cons I have heard it was built on the F 150 frame F 250 frame and F 350 frame I cant not_seem not_to not_find not_the not_exact not_frame not_ive not_ruled not_out not_the not_F not_150 not_frame as that is what the Expedition is on I dont not_think not_Ford not_would not_put not_their not_biggest not_vehicle not_on not_the not_mid not_sized not_frame not_im not_almost not_certain not_that not_the not_Excursion not_is not_on not_the not_F not_350 not_frame Where as many people agree this truck is too big it does offer things to counter that Such as oversize mirrors reverse sensors optional and drop down window sills that make it easier to see out of the sides ive heard that the sound system is quite exceptional in this vehicle although I dont not_know not_the not_exact not_number not_of not_speakers not_or not_the not_setup not_Ford not_has not_heard not_the not_cry not_from not_the not_compact not_car not_drivers and they have run support bars that will keep the Excursion from decapitating your Metro ive heard people complain of parking in this vehicle no matter how bad the steering is you get used to it and soon you wont even realize that you have to turn a bit more watch a little better and swing wider than in the car Safety is a big part of this vehicles selling point
Pos,Then I drove each one The Excursion is a very versatile vehicle The Excursion is indeed very big and intimidating at first It is a pleasure to drive He decided that he would trade up for an Excursion that weekend It has a switch to shut the tone off while towing When you are finished you stop and turn the control back to 2 wheel drive This is something that I required three vehicles to accomplish in the past You need at least 6 6 of clearance room to fit in a parking garage My family practically lives in this vehicle and it is so easy to clean them It goes off if someone or a small animal walks behind the vehicle while backing up The cargo space in the back is perfect for my dogs kennels and for putting everyones stuff It has been a lifesaver on the long trips we have taken with the kids and their friends Its safe for your passengers and safer in a collision for a smaller car than any other SUV out there It takes less gas to haul 8 people around in an Excursion than it does in two small cars It averages about 12 miles to the gallon driving around town and about 15 miles to the gallon on long road trips You just stop the vehicle and turn the control on the dash to the four wheel drive setting you wish to use I spent a lot of time researching and test driving many other vehicles before I made my decision to purchase my Ford Excursion The Excursion has good things to offer and they far out weigh any of the disadvantages of owning this vehicle It handled the load like it weighed nothing I use it to transport kids in a carpool to and from school If you need to transport a lot of people and their gear or big loads of stuff the Excursion will serve you well It beeps faster as you get closer to an object and emits a solid tone when you are twelve inches away from an object or wall If you do not not_wear not_a not_seatbelt it will chime intermittently until the seat belt is fastened I would recommend leather seats for easy cleanup Thats a big difference from when my Dad used to have to climb out of his truck to put it into four wheel drive It takes a little getting used I spent about a month getting used to it in some areas that were not not_very not_populated This is the first year that we have traveled in peace because everyone had their own space and was not not_touching not_the not_person not_next not_to not_them You just need to be a responsible driver and take the time to get to know the vehicle just like you would any other vehicle It fits in my home garage just fine I have the back up sensors I feel every vehicle should have back up sensors You will be glad you spent the money Even with adults it is amazing how much stuff can end up on the seats It took about two weeks of practice in and empty parking lot to learn to park it It does not not_fit not_in not_many not_of not_the not_mall not_parking not_garages It helps get the job done I highly recommend it You really have to drive it see what it is like Chris It has big mirrors that can be folded in to give more room if you are in a tight spot and people need to walk by the vehicle It is a big step to climb up into it but it is nice to be able to see the roadway ahead I know that my kids and passengers are safe It can be a very comfortable car and a very hard working truck I have had many uses for it and it has given this busy Mom much more time and ease to get the big jobs done If anything I think I have become a more conscientious driver and I watch for areas that are more open in traffic to make maneuvers that require more time and space It seats all my passengers comfortably with lots of elbowroom to spare I have had 8 adults in this vehicle and they were all amazed at the spaciousness of the interior and all the creature comforts It only emits the tone when you put the vehicle in reverse I dont not_know not_how not_I not_ever not_lived not_without not_the not_seat not_warmers not_I not_just not_recently not_used not_the not_Four not_wheel not_drive not_and not_it not_was not_so not_easy When I first started shopping I must admit that I was not not_even not_considering not_the not_Excursion not_I not_drove not_practically not_all not_the not_SUVs not_on not_the not_market not_and not_while not_at not_my not_Ford not_dealership not_they not_put not_the not_Explorer not_Expedition not_and not_Excursion not_side not_by not_side It is also more environmentally friendly I read on another review of this vehicle that it emits 6 pounds less pollution a year than other SUVs and as I said earlier more than 85 of the vehicle can be recycled when the cars life is over We had a pull down monitor installed in the center part of the ceiling just behind the drivers seat and a DVD player along with an electrical outlet to plug in my sons Sega Dreamcast in the back of the console that fits between the drivers seat and the front passenger seat We do have the right to choose what we drive I chose the Ford Excursion and I am willing to take on the responsibility to drive in a safe manor so that I can accomplish the tasks that I need to accomplish with its assistance The mirrors also pull out for towing I have had many people come up to me and ask if they can see my vehicle I even had one guy sit in it for 20 minutes on a ferryboat admiring everything it had to offer It is a bit of a shock at the gas pump filling up the 44 gallon tank Most gas stations pumps shut off at 50 00 and it takes right around 60 00 to fill the huge tank but I dont not_have not_to not_make not_a not_trip not_to not_the not_gas not_station not_as not_often not_as not_I not_used not_to not_with not_my not_old not_minivan Then eased into the city I have had my Excursion since mid March of 2000 and one day in early May 2000 I noticed that I was truly confident in driving it I do take a little more time in making lane changes and am very careful to check mirrors and the area around my vehicle To my amazement the Excursion handled beautifully and much smoother than the Expedition or Explorer I need a vehicle that can transport people and all their things I also cook for 200 kids at a week long camp in the summer and the Excursion met all my criteria and then some I filled it from one end to the other with food for one week The tailgate is split in half and very light weight and easy to open I really liked it much better than the Suburban that has a bar that runs down the center of the glass Its back gate is much heavier than the Excursion I have had two hand surgeries and the Excursions back doors are a breeze to open and close The things that impressed me when I was shopping is that it meets the Low Emission Standards for pollution in all 50 states it has a blocker beam that absorbs most of the energy and keeps a smaller car from sliding under the vehicle in a crash More than 85 of the vehicle can be recycled at the end of its life and Ford has used recycled materials in producing this vehicle Be a safe

Pos,The answer The new Ford Excursion My personal interaction with this truck is of testdriving What could hurt the thing besides a bus But it has a surprising 700 mile range on one fill up The rear hatch opens three ways to cut down on those huge rear doors It has a massive 44 gallon fuel tank which takes upward of 60 dollars to fill It accelerates 0 60 in about 10 6 seconds which is quick for a 4 ton vehicle It is 5 4 5 8 inches taller than the Suburban featuring one of the flattest cargo racks available The 4X4 suspension is different than that of the 4X2 but being as long as it is high centering is a problem It comes with the Triton V10 the 5 4 V8 or the optional 7 2 liter Powerstroke Up front it boasts two plush captains chairs with a center console The spare rests inside neatly packed away against the driver side of the vehicle After testdriving I found that the ride was smooth but firm Just last year GM had an untouched SUV class that of the Suburban A class that sold about 150 000 vehicles one that Ford just couldnt let go unchallenged The V10 sports 310 hp 425 lb ft while the diesel comes with around 500 lb ft of torque or a 5 4 Triton V8 rated at 255 hp Safety is great due to its size The dash and instrument cluster is that of the f250 Further back there are two rows of seats which can fold down or be removed to give the Excursion 16 Cubic feet of cargo space over the Suburban This hulking SUV is now the biggest in its class How big Well about 4 tons Its about 3 3 inches wider than the Suburban and about 7 2 inches longer Its set on a f250 frame and from the side looks like a van but the front end is that of the superduty Even though this is a fully capable 4X4 off road use is limited again to its size Added guards under the front bumper keeps cars from sliding under the vehicle in the case of a head on accident Even weighing 4 tons doesnt keep the Excursion from towing around 10 000 pounds The cool overhead console displays besides other things about how many miles you have left in your tank Price is a big factor About 34 K for the XLT model 40 800 for the limited Which for the dollar isnt not_a not_big not_increase not_from not_that not_of not_the not_explorer not_or not_a not_nice not_f2 not_or not_350 not_Roll not_over not_is not_that not_of not_any not_big not_SUV not_Ford not_has not_taken not_great not_pains not_to not_limit not_roll not_over not_as not_much not_as not_possible not_without not_sacrificing not_too not_much not_clearance
Pos,The space is incredible The seats are adjustable and heated My reason for considering the EXCURSION was its size primarily The ones I had looked at seated at least eight One thing to watch is how long it is on the nose and on the tail It can tow up to 10 000 pounds Great buy I got mine a Limited with leather seats for around 37 000 It is heads and shoulders above the Suburban First of all it is bigger more beautiful and a better bet as far as towing capacity It was a bear to park the first time but I have the hang of it now anyone who has several people to drive about needs this vehicle When I test drove it the ride was smooth and controlled I have had it now for about two weeks and it is the best vehicle I have ever owned All the instruments are within reach and I am a very small female The kids love it The leg room is ample enough for adults to sit VERY comfortably all the way to the back bench seat I traded in a 1998 Toyota Forerunner Limited for it That was a great car too but it didnt not_ride not_half not_as not_smooth not_on not_the not_road not_as not_this not_vehicle
Pos,These figures are based on 2000 and 2001 truck models This is almost the same size as the Excursion It drives and rides smoothly and handles corners with ease There is plenty of room for strollers suitcases camping gear etc The Excursion obviously weights more but it also has to protect more passengers Thats a difference of almost 31 in length and 15 5 in width While I knew I needed a large vehicle common sense also tells me that the gas mileage would be poor All seats in the Excursion offer generous leg head and elbow room I have even sat in the 3rd row seat very comfortably The shorter truck version is 241 4 long The 150 Super Duty Crew Cab is 225 9 long 79 8 wide and 77 2 high The trucks and Excursion obtain about the same gas mileage 12 MPG give or take about 1 mile to the gallon although the Excursion Power Stroke engine is about 17 MPG If you re in the market for an Expedition take your time in test driving it and contemplate what you will use it for because it isnt not_for not_everyone but I am extremely happy with it While many people think this is by far the largest vehicle minus semis buses and RVs on the road I must disclose that this is not not_true not_The not_Excursion not_is not_226 not_7 not_long not_80 not_wide and 79 5 high and 7150 lbs The Super Duty Crew Cab 350 Pickup is 257 6 long 95 5 wide 5604 lbs and unknown height Most the complaints about this vehicle is that it is too large and uses too much gas People with large families really dont not_have not_many not_choices not_when not_it not_comes not_to not_a not_vehicle not_which not_is not_able not_to not_carry not_the not_entire not_load not_I not_didnt not_want not_to not_buy not_two not_vehicle not_which not_together not_would not_use not_more not_gas not_than not_the not_Excursion not_alone I own the limited version of this vehicle and also have a large family ive had an Expedition which I was very happy with for the past two years but we are currently selling it Unfortunately our family has outgrown it One of the reasons for buying the Excursion is the extra room behind the 3rd seat which the Expedition didnt not_offer The seats are very comfortable for long trips I have the 7 3 L Power Stroke diesel engine which obtains about 17 MPG compared to the 12 MPG of the other version Personally other than the recent spike of gas prices which is already working its way back down I have no complaints in the amount of gas I need to buy The 17 MPG is very comparable to the many mini vans on the road Once you familiarize yourself with this vehicle its surprisingly maneuverable and easy to park
Pos,This truck is meant for people who want safety towing and cargo capacity and the great feeling of a luxury LARGE truck There were really only two SUVs that I was considering The Chevrolet Suburban and the Ford Excursion After doing extensive research and test driving I realized that the Ford Excursion was in a class of its own The Ford is safer and larger than the Suburban and was obviously designed with safety and capacity as a goal I wont argue that the Suburban is a great 4x4 but if you test drive both and can afford the gas for the Ford I think you will also realize that the Ford is the better truck I found myself stopped behind a Suburban at a traffic light when I was driving home from the dealer with my new Excursion and it was at that point that I realized how much larger the Ford is I was blown away by the acceleration of the V 10 engine it sure didnt not_seem not_like not_I not_was not_driving not_a not_4 not_ton not_truck
Pos,The fit and finish are excellent It is a bit noisy compared to the gas models It has 4 wheel disk brakes load range D tires a class4 hitch and will tow 10000lbs The diesel has plenty of get up and go and should satisfy most people This vehicle may not not_be not_for not_all not_people but if you tow a trailer and have children this vehicle is for you The ride is firm but not not_horrible It is built on the F 250 chassis so dont not_expect not_a not_Cadillac not_ride not_I not_opted not_for not_the not_diesel not_which not_gets not_me not_13 not_to not_14 not_mpg not_around not_town not_and not_over not_18mpg not_on not_the not_hwy not_while not_not not_towing The interior is quite comfortable and the stereo system is very good Space for carrying things is second to only a van I really can not not_say not_much not_bad not_about not_this not_vehicle not_I not_will not_say not_that not_unless not_you not_own not_one not_keep not_your not_opinions not_to not_yourself not_people This is not not_a not_site not_for not_do not_gooders not_or not_moral not_opinions not_People not_want not_the not_hard not_facts not_Consumer not_reports not_gave not_it not_a not_lousy not_report but I think when reporting on a vehicle like this you can not not_compare not_it not_to not_the not_BMW not_or not_LEXUS not_suvs not_Sure not_it not_takes not_longer not_to not_stop not_it not_weighs not_7200 not_lbs not_Consider not_that not_is not_nearly not_80 not_heavier not_than not_those not_two not_car not_like not_suvs not_and not_its not_braking not_distance not_is not_not not_bad not_by not_far
Pos,The back up beeper works as advertised It starts beeping at about 5 something feet from an object The oil filter is a behemoth but still not not_extraordinarily not_expensive Ford provides lots of descriptive literature in the owners manual and also provides a manual for the 7 3L Power Stroke I have a 19 year old vehicle which needs to be retired I looked for something to replace it with At the time there was not not_much not_around not_which not_really not_qualified And along came the Excursion with a king size price tag to go with it But everything else filled the bill Size comfort capability and everything else I could ask for Fuel mileage is tolerable at about 18 20 mpg imp This is not not_much not_different not_than not_the not_1998 not_explorer not_17mpg not_on not_a not_good not_day not_which not_we not_traded not_in not_for not_the not_Excursion not_Ha not_Handling not_takes not_a not_bit not_to not_get not_used not_to but once you get on to what to expect its an absolute darling Parking is initially a real experience It takes practice before you go shopping or towing Its nice to have a large fuel tank so you dont not_have not_to not_keep not_looking not_for not_pit not_stops not_I not_checked not_out not_the not_cost not_of not_the not_recommended not_oil not_for not_the not_diesel not_and not_its not_not not_much not_more not_than not_what not_I not_had not_to not_pay not_before The Excursion is not not_for not_the not_faint not_of not_heart not_nor not_just not_for not_the not_rich not_and not_famous not_Its not_a not_well not_built not_beast and will work as advertised and last a long long time Fix or repair daily applies of course since any vehicle requires proper maintenance on a regular schedule Treat it right and you cant not_loose not_on not_this not_one The sensors are susceptible to ice snow and dirt so you have to keep them clean Cant find any squeaks rattles or other annoying noises to complain about Lots of people seem to be complaining about roll in the corners but to them I say slow down and take the corner intelligently according to what you are driving and you will find that there aint no roll Speaking of roll there is no binding on the discs so when you take your foot off the brake the vehicle will roll very easily from a dead stop
Pos,As for the tilting effect So as my opinion goes No this is not not_a not_Car not_truck not_for not_everyone My reason for the purchase of the Excursion are being safe towing power we have a 27 ft travel trailer room for passengers comfort Just everyone be it small car owners or large car owners keep your eyes on the road and what you are doing and not not_on not_what not_someone not_else not_is not_driving No but then I have driven a Big High Top Van Maybe to those who are going from a car to this may feel this But I can not not_say not_that not_As not_for not_rattles not_have not_not not_heard not_any not_and not_the not_seats not_are not_great Yes it is a great driving Truck handles well and I respect it We did fill it up last night and our gas range was about 8 9 However that was the first fill up and we only drove it around town What I am saying to this as I read many opinions about how big and unsafe it was for the Excursion to be out on the road might I add that it is most of these small cars and trucks that are going over the speed limit and taking the chances We big car owners respect the roads and are more observant of our surroundings im sorry all you small car owners feel this way but keep your eyes on the road and off our big Trucks I might I also add there have been F 150 F 250 F 350 on the road for years the only different in this Truck is that it is covered We have been told once we get it broke in and out on highway we should do better Again this is only my opinion and I hope those of you who have just purchased one enjoy it as much as I do mine Again to me it is no different than what I have always driven We just purchased our Excursion this past week As a past owner of a F 150 Conversion Ford Van for over 10 years I have found that the Excursion is not not_much not_more than what I have been driving We purchased a car also this past year to try and keep miles of Van but I found myself going back to driving the van because I never felt safe in a car It handles like a charm hugs the road great and as for parking I just park it like I did my Van As for gas well I did not not_buy not_it not_for not_that not_I not_knew not_it not_was not_not not_much not_on not_gas not_and not_we not_have not_not not_had not_it not_yet not_long not_enough not_to not_find not_out not_We not_purchased not_the not_6 not_8 not_V10 not_Limited not_I not_have not_also not_read not_that not_people not_have not_strong not_feelings not_about not_the not_pollution not_problem not_with not_these not_big not_Trucks not_might not_I not_add not_to not_this not_when not_you not_are not_in not_the not_cities not_look not_around not_at not_our not_transit not_system not_and not_count not_how not_many not_people not_might not_be not_riding not_at not_that not_time not_I not_have not_seen not_at not_times not_when not_there not_are not_maybe not_5 not_people not_on not_the not_buses not_so not_what not_do not_we not_do not_about not_this not_problem
Pos,This truck has excellent power and still handles similar to an Expedition or an Explorer The new Ford Excursion is a huge truck with lots of room for both family and cargo It comes stock with a Triton V 10 engine which will not not_let not_you not_down If you have a big family and a sense of adventure than this is most definitely the truck for you One might say that Ford lacks creativity but if you drive this truck you will see the differences as well as the similarities Talk about power even in 4x4 on some of the toughest trails and inclines this vehicle is not not_to not_heavy not_to not_get not_up not_a not_large not_hill The two trucks are quite similar Since the Explorer is one of the biggest sellers on the market I have a feeling that this truck will succeed because all it is is a much larger Explorer or Expedition If need room and always had a van but want a 4x4 than this is definitely the perfect vehicle Dont worry about the comfort because this is extremely roomy I use this truck at my work I drive a Ford Explorer which is also and Eddie Bauer package
Pos,The gas mileage was wonderful We owned a 1993 aerostar for over six years The aerostar met and far exceeded out greatest expectations The smooth ride easy driving and comfort of the vehicle are exceptional Our family mechanic often stated that maintenance access was convenient for working purposes No one minded if they had to ride in the middle or back accommodations In fact the present owners are still using it for trips to a hospital in a nearby city every week It now has 120 000 miles on it There is nothing to hate about this vehicle There were no major mechanical problems during its entire stay with us We did conduct regular maintenance tire replacements and so forth The seating was most comfortable and convenient Even middle aged ladies from our church enjoyed riding with us to church conferences across the country In fact the option of removing the back seat from time to time proved a helpful asset when carrying luggage groceries or other items If you are looking for a reliable vehicle that shelters people and possessions from the weather that is easy to maintain and easy to drive then this aerostar is what you need to buy We bought it new and sold it in 1999 with 88 000 miles on it We bought it because we were planning yearly vacation educational trips with children and friends and thought it would be an excellent vehicle for this purpose as well as serving as our family work vehicle
Pos,You cant not_beat not_it not_for not_long not_trips We have thoroughly enjoyed the van for the last two years The entertainment for the kids on long trips is priceless It is now August 2000 and two things have changed Well of course to fix it would entail big bucks No more are we there yet or how much longer It had 49 000 miles on it and was in good shape inside We did finally get to Midas and have them check out the brake light Id recommend them to anyone in a second and I have Just as an update Once you get used to driving the size you ll never go back to small cars We bought our used 1994 Econoline E150 Mark III Conversion van in 1998 from friends who didnt not_need not_the not_large not_van not_anymore They went over it thoroughly and didnt not_charge not_us not_by not_the not_way and couldnt find anything wrong with the brakes They explained that the transmission clutch was starting to slip and reset the button so that it wouldnt not_be not_flashing not_on not_our not_trip not_home My concerns have only just now begun Our ABS light on the dashboard started appearing randomly shortly after we purchased the van Yes we would buy a new one if we could afford it They are wonderful vehicles and a joy to drive You dont not_arrive not_at not_your not_destination not_feeling not_beat not_up not_My not_kids not_enjoy not_watching not_movies not_or not_just not_being not_able not_to not_stretch not_out not_in not_all not_that not_space The bottom line is that we are now babying the van trying to decide if we want to fix all the problems or buy a new one They told us that we could continue to drive it dont not_push not_it not_by not_running not_on not_cruise not_control and sometime the light would come on again indicating problems again but when that would be would be anybodys guess He checked it over thoroughly again for no charge and said he wouldnt not_be not_driving not_the not_thing not_much not_longer not_if not_it not_was not_him not_Right not_now not_as not_we not_speak not_it not_is not_in not_the not_garage not_having not_the not_transmission not_replaced not_Looks not_like not_I not_ll not_be not_driving not_this not_one not_a not_few not_more not_years We still dont not_know not_what not_is not_wrong not_there not_Now not_recently not_on not_a not_trip not_of not_course not_the not_OFF not_button not_on not_the not_overdrive not_control not_started not_flashing not_indicating not_that not_something not_was not_going not_on not_with not_the not_transmission not_Luckily not_we not_found not_an not_AAMCO not_place not_that not_was not_willing not_to not_take not_us not_and not_check not_it not_immediately The manager there told us that this is common in these vans and is probably an electrical short which they couldnt fix Kudos to Midas Second the transmission light came on again as we were going on vacation Finally decided to suck it up and take it to a local nonchain transmission shop owned by an friend When we checked with the Midas place locally about it they said it was okay to drive the regular brakes would always be available and they couldnt check it unless the light was actually on Well it always goes off when the van is turned off and of course never comes on when we are close to a place that can check it So that has been an ongoing concern
Pos,But which one They feel like thrones The front buckets first impress with their size Yes a sunroof in a large pickup Then there is the matter of design Three bed lengths are available 5 5 6 5 and 8 feet The click square edged styling of the leather trimmed buckets looks very upscale The driving position is the most carlike of the domestic trucks An optional power sliding rear window is another first with this truck On the Road Is this accurate As expected in such a vehicle visibility forward and to the sides is excellent At 230 inches the SuperCab with 6 5 bed is already a lot of vehicle To my eye this significantly enhances their cargo volume The new pickup beds are a couple of inches deeper than the norm While the exterior styling is clearly evolutionary the interior is revolutionary I 146ve already mentioned the available full center console These seats are considerably firmer than the pickup norm such that you sit on them rather than in them The latter seems an especially significant difference In the Ford you could almost be in a car if one with large seats positioned well above the ground As in other large pickups many different axle ratios with and without limited slip are available to suit different needs highway economy towing etc An innovative torsion bar makes the tailgate easier to open and close than other pickups The styling and interior comfort of the new F 150 suggest a better driving truck For 2005 there will be additional engines includes a V6 and a supercharged V8 A manual transmission should also be available in later years The largest wheels are 18s and though no match for the cartoonish 20s available on the Ram they further enhance the truck 146s bold stance In comparison the center console in GM 146s trucks clumsily integrated with the instrument panel looks even more pathetic than it already did The latter with three valves per cylinder and variable timing for higher efficiency and a broader torque curve produces 365 foot pounds of torque at 3750 RPM This review is identical to that posted under the general F 150 heading except that ive added a section on reliability Many Many Choices They must really be targeting people used to cars 133 Even regular cabs have small rear hinged doors to provide better access to an enlarged internal cargo area The truck I drove lacked this option but based on similar systems in other vehicles I 146ve driven it should work well The Chevrolet is similar while the Dodge seat is mounted so high I found myself planting my left foot flat on the floor 151 no need for a dead pedal Although the new truck is only available in light duty 147half ton 148 form suitably configured it can carry up to 3 000 pounds or tow up to 9 500 What the Ford V8 is is quieter and smoother than the others Three bodies are available regular cab SuperCab rear seat accessed by rear hinged half doors and SuperCrew larger rear seat accessed by four conventional doors Going up one size cab will cost you about 2 500 The SuperCrew is available only with the shortest bed and the 8 foot bed is available only on the XL and XLT and makes for one ungainly 248 inch long truck when paired with the SuperCab The tall cylindrical chrome trimmed shift lever might be a bit too space age and it could feel smoother but it catches the eye and demonstrates the extent of Ford 146s desire to reinvent the pickup cabin So perhaps they tried too hard and have added unnecessary cost as a result Aside from these interior features what most impresses is the level of fit and finish in the interior The Dodge uses rack and pinion with the rear drive chassis only The steering is rack and pinion a first for four wheel drive trucks That said the GM products handle more responsively and intuitively The comparison between them and the front seats in the competition resembles that between modern furniture and a traditional American sofa Okay maybe not not_quite not_that not_large not_a not_difference but it 146s getting there At least this time around the aesthetic jump is not not_as not_drastic not_I not_146 not_m not_not not_going not_off not_road not_so not_the not_faux not_wood not_trimmed not_city not_slicker not_Lariat not_probably not_best not_fits not_how not_I not_would not_use not_such not_a not_vehicle The rear springs are wider while the shocks are mounted outside the frame The frame is nine times stiffer than the old one while the cabs are twice as stiff They possess side bolsters but these are too widely spaced to serve any function for all but the widest people I found these seats comfortable but traditional pickup buyers might find them somehow foreign The FX4 comes standard with the three valve 5 4 liter V8 In comparison the GM 5 3 liter produces five fewer horsepower and 35 fewer foot pounds of torque Will the new F 150 prove unreliable The new F 150 comes in five different models base XL work truck low end sporty STX midrange XLT which will probably be most popular high end sporty off road ready FX4 and luxurious Lariat Trim lines are just the beginning of the choices They add up Unlike the Chevrolet but like the Dodge the SuperCab 146s folding rear seat is split 60 40 Unlike the Dodge there are no nifty storage compartments beneath it but this frees up a big more volume The new sheetmetal is much less striking than the a href content 113078275716 Dodge Rams a click for my review and even less distinctive than the aero influenced old truck 146 s but to my eye it is the most refined and handsome among large pickups The materials might not not_be not_suitable not_for not_a not_Lexus but they 146re nicer than any other Ford I 146ve been in Fits and seams appear very precise which is rarer than it should be in domestic vehicles But I prefer the rugged yet sophisticated styling of the FX4 I also felt that the SuperCab with 6 5 foot standard bed represented the optimal combination of functionality and maneuverability I suspect this configuration will be most popular with non commercial buyers To the rear it 146s not not_so not_good not_owing not_to not_the not_tall not_distant not_rear not_end not_I not_would not_highly not_recommend not_the not_optional not_reverse not_sensing not_system not_I not_don not_146t not_see not_the not_point not_of not_such not_systems not_in not_most not_cars but here I see the point The 6 5 comes in both regular and Flareside styles Going up a bed size costs 300 while the Flareside will set you back another 845 For 2004 two engines are available both V8s a largely carryover 231 horsepower 4 6 liter and an extensively upgraded 300 horsepower 5 4 liter That remains to be seen The truck I drove weighed about 5 700 pounds Glass sunroofs step bars the FX4 146s standard skid plates the stiffer longer frame 133 such features can add serious mass It 146s quicker Bottom line Even with the revised 5 4 and optional 3 73 axle the Ford is hardly quick I especially expected more passing power on the highway The typical discount and a 1 000 rebate take this down to about 30 600 But the Expedition feels much the same and the current Explorer does as well so I suspect this jiggle is inherent in Ford 146s suspension philosophy After test driving this truck and wondering why Ford doesn 146t outfit its cars this well I read a review in Automobile that ventured the same question Between the styling and the materials the new F 150 146s interior shames those in other domestic pickups Accommodations It is hard to imagine it ever looking old or dated already the fate of GM 146s current pickups Like on Ford 146s heavy duty pickups the front side window dips down to lend the styling one brand specific detail and perhaps permit the large side mirrors to be mounted a bit lower In short Ford 146s suspension philosophy might include optimizing the ride with the vehicle heavily loaded Noise of all forms is unexpectedly low in the new Ford The FX4 and Lariat come standard with a 40 20 40 bench like other F 150s but as an option they offer buckets separated by a full center console that flows cleanly into the dash and mounts the shifter a first in this class Even the performance oriented Chevy Silverado SS has a column mounted shifter I 146ve never owned a pickup and possibly never will But I just had to drive the redesigned Ford F 150 as soon as it appeared on dealers lots Why Fords financial health has been shaky lately and no product is more critical to this health than the companys full size pickup the F 150 If this is true for the cars it must also be true for the trucks which are designed to carry loads In comparison a base GM 4WD extended cab truck weighs under 5000 pounds though the 4WD Avalanche clocks in around 5 700 The Dodge falls between the two I also drove the Chevrolet Silverado in 345 horse SS form No power folding rear seat yet though As in all large pickups beginning with the 1993 Dodge Ram cargo compartments within the cabin are generously sized Ford offers an innovative track system that fits various accessories as well as storage on the ceiling but this was replaced in the truck I drove by an optional sunroof The Chevrolet produces considerably more intake roar with little provocation while the Dodge 146s Hemi produced so much mechanical noise at idle that I almost thought the salesman had grabbed the keys to a Cummins diesel by mistake The engines and transmissions are also largely carryover with the exception of the heavioy revised 5 4 liter V8 eliminating a common source of problems But can the new F 150 recoup its large investment and relatively high manufacturing costs Can it bring good times back to Dearborn Throwing some mass in the back might help I 146ve long noted in Consumer Reports that unlike most cars Ford 146s cars often ride better when heavily loaded The V6 in my second year Ford Contour required replacement at 66 000 miles because of an issue known within Ford but not not_admitted not_to not_by not_Ford not_dealers The new Ford F 150 impresses with its style fit and finish and all around refinement I cannot not_recall not_ever not_finding not_a not_standard not_full not_size not_pickup not_so not_appealing However one review I 146ve read suggested this together with the Ford 146s height GM products sit a bit lower makes it hard to reach into the bed and grab stuff Unfortunately I did not not_check not_this not_out but will the next time I have the chance On the one hand if Ford could get any product right straight out of the box it would be this one as they no doubt threw scads of their top talent at this truck For now either engine hooks up to a four speed automatic Although this automatic is supposedly 147new 148 I would expect another before too long as Dodge and soon Nissan offer five speed units Drivetrains include rear wheel drive mechanical shift on the fly four wheel drive and electronic shift on the fly four wheel drive Unlike in Ford 146s large SUVs automatically engaging all wheel drive is not not_available On the other hand side airbags of the curtain variety are only available in the Dodge Traction control and stability control are not not_yet not_available not_on not_any not_of not_these not_four not_wheel not_drive not_trucks not_Reliability not_First not_year not_designs not_from not_Detroit not_brands are often troublesome Ford owners if they knew of a good Ford service department and they all said no Pricing As you might have noticed I drove a truck with most of the available options On the other this was a very complex program and recent first year Fords Focus Escape have been especially troublesome I guess it all comes down to whether you are a betting man The trucks major weakness is too much poundage even for its new stronger engine Overall the new pickup shows what Ford can do when it pours talent and money into the development of a vehicle The Hemi engine will later be available in Chrysler 146s large cars that should be interesting given its very trucky character EPA ratings are 14 18 with four wheel drive 15 19 with rear wheel drive similar to GM 146s 15 18 and one mile per gallon better than Dodge 146s 13 17 They feel somehow more natural despite their overboosted less precise steering The Ford in comparison feels technically superior but distant Another downside the large Fords share a faintly jiggly ride over minor pavement imperfections 147 Taut 148 has a price Granted I drove the F 150 in FX4 form which includes a stiff off road ready suspension But how does it all pan out In character the new F 150 resembles the current Expedition body motions feel more precisely and tightly controlled than in the competition and the steering is firmer and also more precise Lean in turns feels more restrained than in the others especially the non SS GM products 147 Taut 148 comes to mind This option is less practical but to a car guy like myself it takes full size pickups in a whole new

and especially the Dodge seem very trucky after a drive in the Ford But the new Ford is priced far above the Chevrolet and I 146 m unsure how many people will be willing to pay the premium A few months will tell If the truck does prove troublesome I hope Ford dealers know more about this product than the Contour I recently disposed of Even in the Detroit area I experienced much difficulty finding a dealer with a skilled and personable service department I once asked a dozen In the Dodge you 146re clearly in a truck Given the truck 146s height off the ground the optional tubular steps were a great help getting in and out The Chevrolet and Dodge trucks I drove lacked such steps though they are available either from the factory or aftermarket and getting in and out was much harder especially with the latter The Chevrolet 146s seating position is the lowest of the three Especially if you are short or have kids you 146re going to want some form of step with any of these trucks However word of mouth suggests that real world fuel economy is best with the GM trucks People I know with GM trucks typically report fuel economy in the 14 15 range those with Fords in the 11 12 range or worse I suspect the additional weight of the Ford trucks which forces their engines to work harder is to blame Ford claims major frame and suspension improvements for better ride and handling As luck would have it the only F 150 I could find to drive was this configuration Even this one might have been pre sold 151one salesman thought so but the other was willfully ignorant of its status Styling The F 150 146s styling has been updated much like the Explorer 146s was for 2002 and the Expedition 146s was for 2003 Almost too prissy for a truck curves have given way to a more formal more massive broader shouldered look Unlike the last time around the new truck is not not_clearly not_a not_step not_ahead not_of not_the not_old not_one not_it not_146s not_just not_different The SuperCab 146s rear doors might be rear hinged but unlike before and still in the GM products they contain windows that fully retract rather than just pop out One major innovation was missed however I 146ve been told that rear hinged doors can be difficult to use in parking lots as you end up with insufficient room to move about alongside the vehicle when parked next to another vehicle with both doors open Nissan 146s upcoming large pickup solves this problem with a rear hinged door that opens 180 degrees The Ford 146s just opens about 90 Could be an argument for the SuperCrew 133 The pebbled texture of the FX4 146s black 147 sport 148 leather further connotes this is one tough yet ritzy truck Want leather in something other than black Tan leather is available only in the Lariat Although the XL and STX share a non tach instrument cluster the other three trim lines have six gauge clusters that not not_only differ in graphics cream faces in the Lariat for example but in the location of the gauges Varying the latter can be costly and I don 146t see the point Some subtle differences in preferences might be involved but I imagine any of the three gauge layouts would have been fine with pretty much everyone This is the common finding from my test drive refinement refinement refinement Did the Blackwood come a generation too soon I did not not_evaluate not_off not_road not_performance

Fords sales and profits Consequently as goes the new truck so goes the company Well aware of the stakes Ford spared little when fully redesigning its large pickup for 2004 Partly as a result the new F 150 is much more expensive to build than the old one Given the importance of the new F 150 and the amount of effort Ford put into it I felt compelled to check it out Since I 146 m not not_used not_to

148 5 7 liter in the Dodge kicks out 45 more horses but only ten more units of torque 151so in the midrange the two engines aren 146t far apart The Dodge also has another gear ratio to play with How does all of this shake out Well even though I tested the GM engine in the Avalanche which is heavier than the Silverado it felt the perkiest of the three in normal despite having the weakest stats Both the Ford and the Dodge have to be prodded more to get them to perk up At full throttle the Dodge might well have the edge but based on the seat of my pants the difference is too close to call I suspect differences in mass counterbalance those in power When Chevrolet introduced fully redesigned pickups five years ago they eclipsed the competition in rear seat comfort for the first time offering a rear seat in an extended cab with enough knee room and enough angle to the backrest to seat adults in adequate comfort Well the GM product is now the granddaddy of the bunch When Dodge introduced its new truck last year it offered an even roomier rear seat Now it 146s Ford 146s turn to offer the best of the bunch Unlike Ford and Chevrolet Dodge offers only a single extended cab model with four conventional doors Although the Ford SuperCab still uses rear hinged half doors it contains a roomier more comfortable rear seat than the Dodge The SuperCrew rear seat offers another six inches of rear legroom but unless the front seats will be most of the way back i e for tall people up front the SuperCab 146s rear seat provides enough room for medium sized adults and more than enough for children So about dead even with the Ford The Chevrolet is the oldest truck here and GM has priced it to compensate the other two are 3 000 more quite a difference I see lower transaction prices from Ford and Dodge in the future but in the case of the former perhaps only after it stops selling the old F 150 in 2005 Until then the old truck can be used to keep price sensitive buyers from defecting to GM i Update i I ran the above numbers assuming that the Fords electronic four wheel drive system optional on XLT standard on 4WD FX4 and Lariat is a ful time system as the salesman claimed as much But I see no such claim in the brochure and Consumer Guide states that Ford offers only a part time system in the F 150 If so then I have overstated the price of the Chevrolet and Dodge by about 400 The new Ford just seems pricier and pricier Last Words
Pos,INTRO The ride quality is very good So we went to Hudiburg The A C and the heater work very very well The layout is simple and looks clean and tidy There was a beautiful red pickup right by the entrance to the show room More so than if you were in a car but still impressive The mileage counter is digital which is pretty standard nowadays in most vehicles The F 150 i have is the 4 2 v6 with standard transmission The XL comes with chrome wheels as standard and they look pretty sharp It is just a basic F 150 XL but oh boy do i love it FIRST IMPRESSIONS On the XL there is no rev counter just the Speedo oil gauge temperature gauge and fuel gauge He told me that it was the special Oklahoma Texas Package that made it so cheap My truck comes with a bench seat which is actually pretty comfortable and gives a reasonable amount of support You get the usual bouncy ride that you get from most trucks but overall the ride comfort is very good The truck does about 19 MPG on the interstate and about 17 MPG around town which is pretty good That just adds extra cost when you want to replace the stereo which i have just done The dials are big and are very easy to read and in classic ford style they light up green at night The XL is the low end model of the F 150 so there are no extras what you see is what you get The dashboard is once again like the exterior very curvy and real appealing it is nice to look at and is not not_harsh not_on not_the not_eyes It folds forward so you can put a few small items behind the seat I have a complaint about the material used on the seats though It gets cool very quickly in the truck which is what you really need here in Oklahoma and the truck gets nice and warm quickly too The F 150 is very easy on the eye a pure joy to look at The Interior of the truck is basic but everything you need is there The one way for me to fit in For me to become Americanized would be to buy a truck And i love the F 150 FROM DEALERSHIP TO DEALERSHIP It costs me about 25 00 to fill the tank from scratch The Interior Noise is pretty high but compared to earlier model F 150s it has improved greatly The steering column is not not_adjustable and the bench seat only moves back and forward and the back really doesnt move very much so you are always sitting in an upright position ON THE OPEN ROAD There is plenty of room in the bed of the truck for whatever you want to put in there and man does having a truck come in handy The stereo and the a c and heat controls are within good reach of the driver and they are very easy to operate though i think the stereo could be better i also wish that ford would stop fitting double din stereos in their vehicles The truck handles pretty well and it comes with power steering as standard which always makes life easier Another thing that really surprises me with the truck is that there is very little roll when you turn into corners The salesman told me it was a 2003 i told him i could not not_afford not_it and then he told me the price 12 988 After i picked my jaw up off the floor and put my eyes back in their sockets i was ready to take the beast for a test drive It really isn 146t very good I would have thought that being a truck the fabric would have been a bit tougher but it is not not_About not_2 not_months not_after not_buying not_the not_truck not_the not_stitching not_begun not_undoing and holes started appearing and that is just through normal use so i have now brought seat covers to stop further damage to the fabric The engine puts out 202BHP and is plenty powerful for everyday use Correct me if i am wrong but i think the 4 2 V6 is only 20 BHP Less than the 4 6 V8 The Truck is quick not not_lightning not_quick but there is ample power there Over taking on the interstate is not not_a not_problem nor is having little fun at the lights Trucks you either love them or you hate them Me I love them Trucks in England are extremely rare if you did own one it would be almost impossible to afford to run one I wanted a truck so bad When i moved to Oklahoma i could not not_believe not_the not_amount not_of not_people not_who not_owned not_trucks If you have read any of my other reviews on automobiles you will know that i am quite particular on what i like I like my vehicles to be curvy I have no idea why This was a big deciding factor in what truck i wanted to buy The F 150 looks beautiful Sleek curves and lots of chrome and a re designed grill for 2003 We just moved into our first house and i do not not_know not_what not_we not_would not_have

not_and not_will not_probably not_last not_you not_a not_life not_time My only other niggle is that the truck is rear wheel drive I understand why that is but when there is nothing in the bed of the truck the back wheels tend to spin very easily so you have to take great car when driving this vehicle the wheels spin if there is loose gravel on the road and it can be pretty bad when it has rained so you just have to be that extra bit careful With so many dealerships and so many different types of trucks out there my wife and i set out early I knew i wanted a ford im a ford man Always have been always will be you always know what you are going to get with fords Reliable dependable transportation at reasonable prices I started out looking at used trucks i found a 2000 XL model for 10 000 and was really tempted to buy it but i wanted to look around at one more dealership
Pos,The wipers have only one intermittent setting An annoying engineering problem is the windshield wipers are different sizes The gas tank is only 12 gallons so expect about 300 miles between fill ups On a tight budget after first getting married my wife and I bought a brand new 1993 Ford Escort Wagon for 9 300 Sure enough a pair of Goodyear Weatherhandlers and 60 000 miles later we have not not_had not_a not_recurrence not_of not_the not_problem The interior is very spartan in appearance and the vinyl and plastic look cheap Compared to other cars in its class Saturn Civic Cavalier Corolla its on par To conclude this is not not_the not_most not_comfortable not_car not_heads will not not_turn not_when not_you not_drive not_it not_its not_had not_some not_problems It hasnt been perfect but what has gone wrong have been minor annoyances see list at bottom of this epinion It came with A C dual powered remote mirrors manual transmission roof rack and a cassette stereo Seven years and 93 000 miles later the car is still running great It lasts for about five seconds between wipes and it is a feature seldom used unless the rain is coming down at just the right rate The car has lots of room for cargo and the roll over cargo cover is great when you want to shade frozen groceries or just keep a passer by from looking into your car The 60 40 split folding seats are life savers when taking trips to home depot Controls throughout the car are too small Small radio buttons with completely un intuitive radio clock settings small fuel filler release lever small climate control levers Admittedly it is a small car but ive driven a Saturn and the controls were far larger Two child seats fit in the back seat but only the smallest of children could fit between the two child seats essentially making this a four seater until the children get bigger Ride comfort is acceptable for short trips and bearable for long trips Road noise is pervasive at high speeds and handling is fair One big problem were the original tires After 30 000 miles the car started handling very poorly and I noticed the tires were wearing in an odd fashion A mechanic thought the suspension was shot based on the wear of the tires but a friend of ours said a good pair of tires fixed her problem After sizing up just one of the wipers I went to the store and bought a package of wipers they always come in twos I had to go back to the store after realizing the second wiper was a different size but at least the next time I need wipers I ll have a complete set Gas mileage has been excellent averaging about 28 mpg But and this is a big but its never not_broken not_down it holds lots of cargo only cost 9 300 new and has a current Kelley Blue Book trade in value of 2 400 whats not not_to not_love not_about not_this not_car not_Whats not_gone not_wrong not_related not_cost not_1 not_Plastic not_cap not_holder not_on not_windshield not_washer not_fluid not_broke not_never not_fixed not_2 not_Plastic not_driver not_seat not_belt not_holder not_broke not_15 not_part did work myself 3 Rubber insulator around rear passenger door 6 part did work myself 4 Broken rear suspension spring 400 including labor
Pos,The seats are comfortable This car would normally be fairly inexpensive This car was really nice to drive It handles well on the road even in the snow Then my first child came and the extra room just made sense We could throw the stroller diaper bag portable playpen crib all in the back of the Escort for a trip to Grandmas house It that were true in my case I would probably still have this car Unfortunately I made some bad choices and ended up with a lot of negative equity I had a 1993 Escort Wagon I owned this vehicle longer than any other vehicle before or since I really liked this car Believe it or not not_I not_was not_one not_of not_those not_people not_who not_swore not_that not_I not_would not_never not_own not_a not_station not_wagon This car ended up with the brunt of the inequity and an extremely high interest rate to go with it So as much as I loved this car I hated the price I had to pay for it I was lucky enough to find a car dealership that would help me rectify this situation and gave me a great deal on my last 2 vehicles if you live in Western Washington check out Automotive Alternatives in Bremerton they were great I really liked this car I cant not_think not_of not_anything not_bad not_about not_it not_No not_costly not_repairs not_no not_breakdowns not_just not_routine not_service
Pos,Ok its not not_new not_anymore Oh I havent babied it any This tough little tiger has seen seven unfriendly Montana winters and faithfully carried me over small back country wooded one lane gravel roads The brake pedal looks worn and the new car smell is long gone but I still love my Ford Escort Wagon I bought my Ford wagon brand new in 1993 Its been afforded all the basic upkeep required i e regular oil changes the ocassional trip to the car wash etc Now 105 000 miles later I still cant not_bring not_myself not_to not_part not_with not_it not_Even not_today not_it not_is not_my not_main not_source not_of not_transportation It almost single handedly served as a moving van for my family several times and has served to push another of our lesser vehicles to a safe parking place when the other vehicle failed me I am absolutely amazed at how My Ford Escort Wagon performs for me My fuel economy is favorable and manuerablity is faithful im not not_ready not_to not_go not_shopping not_for not_a not_new not_vehicle not_just not_yet but one day when my little station wagon has reached the limits of its usefulness there is no question that I ll be back on the Ford lot looking to bring home the next generation
Pos,How do you like that BMW and Mercedes fans Our little car does 55 to 65 MPH without breathing too heavily We live in South Texas and use the car for local travel only the best use of its service My wife and I currently own a 1993 Ford Escort LX E 4 door hatchback and never cease to be amazed by its economic upkeep reliability and capabilities And best yet unlike these other vehicles the Escort only requires an oil change cost about 20 about every 3500 miles and a major service costing about 600 every 25 000 miles We usually travel limited access highways and the Escort keeps up with the BMWs Mercedes and 18 wheelers reasonably well although the power we have is obviously lower The October 1999 NADA values on this car make it a great buy if you can find one in good condition Trade in 3 175 Loan 2 875 Retail 4425 A really good price on this vehicle in good not not_perfect not_condition would be about 3 000 and a good price would be about 3 500 Anything above Retail is a rip off My wife is a real do it yourselfer who likes wood working By using the hatch back feature we have been able to haul at different times of course a table saw a treadmill walking machine a router and router table several sheets of plywood and over 10 2x4s
Pos,A few months ago my wife and I went car shopping We went looking for a Tracker A really good car when we have a car seat and a 2 year old LOL Well that day we test drove about 10 cars Just as we thought our search was going no where I saw the Escort sitting right by the Tracker we tried 1st We get about 30 mile to the gallon and with todays prices you can not not_beat not_that not_The not_one not_thing not_I not_worried not_about not_was not_the not_leg not_room not_Being not_6 not_5 not_it not_is not_hard not_to not_find not_a not_good not_car not_with not_leg not_room To my surprise the wagon is very roomy Well as long as no one has to sit behind me So I have to say I really do like my new car even though it is an 1993 Does this mean I am getting old LOL We test drove the car and loved the way it drove A lot better car for a growing family than a Tracker I have to say I never saw me owning a station wagon but I will not not_trade not_it not_in not_now not_Being not_an not_Escort not_the not_gas not_mileage not_is not_great
Pos,This was very nice No complaints in this department So this was a welcome change The driver was treated to a power lumbar support It contained 2 cup holders able to accommodate my rather large coffee mug In the center of the seat there was a fold down console This particular Ford is a teal colored yuck short box with 73 000 miles on the odometer The buttons were extremely small making it very easy to hit the wrong button It is fitted with the optional 5 8 liter 351 c u V8 mated to an automatic overdrive transmission But if it was my choice I would choose the 95 Chevy 1 2 ton over this Ford The windows rolled up and down very fast I own a 1987 K5 Blazer and my power windows are pathetically slow This truck was equipped with the power window door package I found the power windows locks to be very efficient This model was equipped with a 60 40 split seat in front I found the seats to be fairly comfortable The small fold down back seat is designed for small children not not_adults not_I not_did not_not not_care not_for not_the not_stock not_sound not_system First off let me state that I do not not_own not_this not_1995 not_Ford not_F150 not_4wd not_XLT not_Supercab not_Pickup not_that not_I not_am not_about not_to not_review It was an AM FM stereo cassette w four speakers Sound quality was very poor and could not not_drown not_out not_the not_excessive not_road not_noise not_that not_this not_Ford not_exhibited These trucks are work trucks I do not not_baby not_them not_I not_use not_them not_With not_that not_said not_here not_is not_my not_opinion not_of not_the not_1995 not_Ford not_F150 Also the stereo was placed in a very awkward position in the dash I had to reach very far toward the center of dash to turn channels In terms of safety features this truck contained rear anti lock brakes dont not_quite not_understand not_the not_reasoning not_here and a driver side airbag A passenger side airbag was non existent In terms of reliability of this truck my friend has had darn good luck thus far Like I mentioned above the truck now has 73 000 miles on the clock This engine provided very adequate power I set the cruise at 75 mph and the truck held it even going up steep inclines that brought tractor trailers and vw buses to a crawl The console also had compartments inside for currency notebooks cell phones etc I am 6 2 and found legroom to be acceptable Rear passenger legroom is limited though as is with any extended cab pickup Maybe the poor ride quality could be contributed partially to the type of tires he is running I dont not_know not_Secondly not_I not_thought not_there not_was not_more not_road not_noise not_entering not_the not_cab then was acceptable Thirdly I found this truck wanders When this truck would wander into a rut on the interstate it would pull suddenly to one side than the other If one wasnt not_holding not_onto not_the not_steering not_wheel not_with not_both not_hands not_it not_could not_take not_you not_by not_surprise not_I not_dont not_know not_what not_caused not_this not_tires not_suspension This could prove to be very hazardous when driving First thing I would do if this was my vehicle is upgrade the stereo with an after market system I had the opportunity to use both the air conditioning and the heater on my short 1 2 day trip gotta love Wyoming I found both worked fantastic He has had some problems with keeping the truck aligned might be linked to the wandering problem and front wheel bearings going out I believe that is the only problems he has had in the four years he has owned the truck I personally like the styling of this 95 F150 better than the new styling of the Ford F150s My best friend owns this truck I borrowed it from him recently on a 320 mile round trip to pick up an item I bought out of state Some of you are probably asking yourselves how can he write up a review on a vehicle that he doesnt even own Let me add though that my job provides me the opportunity to drive A LOT of different makes of light duty trucks 1 2 ton 3 4 ton and 1 tons The automatic transmission seemed to be very smooth and precise during shifting With the cruise control set at 75 mph the tach read a very respectable 2200 rpm I was very impressed with this since engine life would probably be extended with such a low engine rpm I have no complaints whatsoever with the engine and tranny in this Ford I would recommend this engine over the smaller 5 0 liter 302 c u V8 especially if you plan on pulling a trailer of any size Also I checked the mileage on my 320 mile journey all interstate driving I got 15 6 mpg I would say this is par with other makes of 1 2 tons in the 1995 model year Not as good as our 97 chevy 1 2 ton 4X4 350 c u I use at work I can squeeze 20 mpg out of her This Ford contained two gas tanks to minimize gas station stops A nice plus I thought the ride quality of this 1 2 ton Ford was quite harsh compared to other makes of 1 2 ton trucks I have driven I could feel every crack and bump I traversed on the interstate I could even feel the vibrations through the steering wheel I couldnt blame the poor ride on bad shocks since I know my buddy just replaced the shocks
Pos,The size of the truck gives a good ride My commute is comfortable Even during long drives to New England all the family has adequate room The truck weighs about 4500 with fuel driver ive crossed the scales at the landfill weighing 6800 It does all of these things very well I bought the Eddie Bauer version 2wd 5L auto trans towing package I chose this vehicle for several reasons mainly the ability to comfortably carry a family of four haul lots of stuff and tow It is used to carry construction supplies and debris take the family and accompanying baggage toys camping or traveling and tow various things boats trailers etc Two fuel tanks are a nice thing to have If this truck ever becomes a repair problem 175 200k miles I will definitely purchase another Ford Probably a bigger one On one occasion pulling a trailer load of asphalt to be recycled the combined weight was over 14 000 Okay maybe ive overloaded once in awhile Still the original brakes with 20 wear left good for another 15 000 miles or so Fuel mileage is around 15 mpg which I consider reasonable for the way I drive The truck now has 109 000 miles on it Oil is changed regularly tires rotated every 5 10 000k miles ive had NO PROBLEMS with it The original tires werent replaced until 63 000 miles If you want a vehicle that does many things well and reliably this is it If you want something to zip around the city in you may consider something else Although there is the intimidation factor
Pos,The ground clearance is larger than in pervious models In the first 4 months of work this pickup has truly proven its self The engine performance is ok given it is such a small motor I would love to have the old 460 v 8 in every pickup ever built This pickup also has several in cab dodads that I like Such as more comfortable seats additional compartments outdoor temperature indicator and easy adjustments to it all The gas mileage is decent 18 20 with the 298 v 8 better than I expected and that does not not_seem not_to not_change not_much not_when not_hauling not_heavy not_loads not_5000 not_lbs In my line of work I go places and sometimes carry more weight than most people would even try Believe me or not not_I feel this pickup could go anywhere a army jeep can strait from the factory I bought a new Ford due to the history I have with the company I have owned 3 Ford pickups and all have lasted past 300 000 miles with understandable maintenance I recommend this pickup for everyone who truly needs a pickup It was difficult to find a pickup with all of my specifications that I needed and had to special order this one I do recommend the following hand crank windows for longevity of use 5 speed manual trans for better mpg less engine strain in mud and towing and emergency push starting I do not not_like not_the not_new not_body not_style although it is growing on me The lack of front fenders with this body style allows a steady rain of mud amp gunk to fall on the overly large front windshield when 4 wheel drive is needed I also do not not_like not_the not_car not_like not_interior not_set not_up not_Although not_the not_cab not_is not_roomy not_this not_set not_up not_wastes not_space not_and not_is not_hard not_to not_clean not_Another not_downside not_of not_this not_pickup is that unless you are a mechanic you can not not_fix not_any not_major not_problems not_that not_may not_arise not_yourself not_Just not_open not_the not_hood not_for not_yourself
Pos,But there are strong similarities This too speaks volumes for its usability and quality The debatable air bags that have swept the world are of course standard The main Australian designed and built cars are little different from those used in the USA However the two most important safety features being ABS and Power Torque Control were standard as would be expected The proceeds of this write off go to Mikes wife in his memory May he rest in peace B However I do know enough to realize the Crown does follow the near universal basics of medium and big cars That is rear wheel drive and a penchant for effortless highway cruising while still being quite maneuverable enough for the rigors of big city traffic While the Crown Victoria I rented drove extremely well I was surprised to learn it still had the old solid axle type rear suspension instead of the newer Independent Rear Suspension or IRS Here by US standards the Crown does quite well but there is substantial room for improvement since equal Australian cars do about twenty percent better Perhaps the slightly cheaper fuel due to differing Taxation makes the difference For the average motorist its obvious that these basics are still the preferred vehicle type despite the plethora of mostly Japanese and Korean buzz boxes on offer in both countries Perhaps this is because both Australia and the USA are relatively large with long distance driving common So how do I know Well about 18 months ago I had to spend a week in the Us and I sought to rent as similar a vehicle as possible to that that I drive and own here in Australia This review is written in memory of our late friend and fellow Epinionater Mike Lambert Roadiem Okay let me be straight up front about this Yes I am Australian and no the cars driven in the USA are not not_the not_same not_as not_here not_in not_Australia Things have changed a bit though with US cars no longer having Football Field size trunks and engine bays big enough for a spare engine resulting in much more compact designs compared to those of say twenty years ago Fuel consumption is no doubt the major reason The perfect vehicle for the role was the Ford Crown Victoria even though the name conjures up the Queen yuk or a famous Australian beer Since I drove one 1 800 miles around the Us East Coast without hitting one kangaroo I feel qualified to report on its virtues And try as I did I found it impossible not not_to not_make not_some not_comparisons not_with not_Aussi not_cars not_well not_sufferin not_snakes not_I not_tried not_Apart not_from not_getting not_in not_on not_the not_right not_hand not_side not_incessantly I found this vehicle to be near identical to my Aussi Ford Futura They ll have the damn things on pushbikes next I noticed Crown Victorias everywhere so they must be high in the sales stakes and surely that alone speaks for itself I understand they are even the vehicle of choice of many if not most Government Agencies including the Police So thats what an Alien thinks of the Crown Victoria in a nutshell this vehicle would hold its head high in any company as a practical well priced family car with outstanding touring capabilities mixed with good city driving attributes I found it both easy and enjoyable to drive the ultimate test of any vehicle and I have no doubt it would be at the top of my list if I was a USA Citizen That brings me to the only real fault in this car and all USA cars that being there is no warning to get in the left hand side if you want to drive it its so damn embarrassing jumping in the right side for a quick take off with nothing there Now seriously to me and I suspect most people a car is either working or its broken so you wont be bored here with a whole lot of mechanical jargon This review is a joint effort between SMITHSWOODSIDE and LadyCynic whose personal generosity in this regard makes me cringe in disbelief please also visit LadyCynics site Please read the other write off entrants listed below bjcuevas napthalia seether 166 sherrylee mattjoe viper1963 gollygumdrops noniaBidnis nightshade 01 obnox Hawkseafan Yyvonne diverpam T Hall mtuairau jennifa PPerky1954 hnnygrlca rcknron3 MiDoyle charlesnep LatteChick garfield 12 bgoodday chrisceb alwaysstubborn nwinston hirohito99 sweetcece theworm ginahill jpmcgurk tiffer 0220 juliette elorraine imames pipet sparkospunky disartain Linda527 Lisa J lgcurcio yahoo kristinafh tgreenway pambo friskycelery tjarnold iculooking todd teddiec Darby Walters wolfman309 emeleel joubert technologyrep gamblinfamily

Pos,No problems during warranty The Crown Vic is great for prolonged surveillance operations All prices were at the Dealership out of warranty parts amp labor I hope to god that I will get another one This vehicle is nearing 92 000 miles and will be decomissioned at 100K This is a very nice car and I have had it since new In normal everyday life I drive a Volvo S70 While working I drive my Crown Victoria There were a few problems with the car that are typical with any 92 Crown Vic If you love rear drive performance at a good price look no further My next car 2001 Crown Victoria These have made a remarkable improvement and has deleted the 110 MPH engine cutoff I got the 1995 model which has the updated transmission and new interior that like of a 2000 model Very good ergonomics The gas mileage is poor and the power is lackluster however I convinced my employer to designate funds to make a couple of changes A 2 chamber flowmaster dual exhaust was installed very quiet underdrive pulleys hypertech chip and a K amp N Air Filter It is very comfortable and I love the color its Dark Green a k a Willow I was given this car for work as my Buick Park Avenue Ultra was totalled I liked the Park Avenue because the dashboard doubled as a M amp M dispenser on long trips The tranny needed to be tuned up at 60 K Miles 100 at 65 K the Check Engine light illuminated which 99 of the time indicates that your EGR passage in the intake manifold is carboned up 125 and at the same time the horn button discentigrated 50 New tires at 70 K and Front brakes at 85 K Who should buy this If you have a big family I have had 11 people in this car once live in your car or travel a lot for work this is the car Amazingly it is very easy to park it has been shot at three times and all three bullets missed so it is not not_as not_big as it looks
Pos,But it has horrible gas mileage and is quite ugly Lets put it this way my grand mother drives this car It is rahter big and some what comfortable in the interior However it is dependable so if that is what you are looking for this is a good car It handles turns pretty well but the acceleration isnt not_that not_great and it is a real pain to park because it is so wide and long If your are under 60 years of age and want to hold up any kind of an image this car might not not_be not_a not_good not_idea
Pos,The car is boilerplate reliable The biggest repair has been a power window motor replacement The car just turned 142 000 miles and it still seems brand new The cars only weak point is its oil consumption about 1 quart per 250 miles But my wife continues to use the Vic as regular transportation to work shopping etc For its size the Vic handles well has plenty of power is comfortable and quiet The birth of our third child obliged us to sell our Mustang 5 liter in 1992 and buy a new Crown Vic after test driving every full size car on the market We plan to keep the Vic as long as it makes economic sense to do so and as long as it remains such a pleasure to drive The trunk is huge I keep a notebook in the car and it shows that we get 27 mpg on the highway year in amp year out Because we recently adopted two more kids we bought a new Chevy Venture minivan If all goes well when our 12 year old turns 16 he can drive it and take himself amp the other 3 to school The Crown Vic is a keeper I sold this car May 17 2000 we werent using it enough to justify keeping it The book value was about 1600 but because it still drove so well and looked so new I sold it for 3000 to the first person who came to see it He thought the car was a bargain at that price
Pos,The car is very comfortable However the car is not not_perfect The problems are in the fit and finish The anti lock brakes have also kicked in a couple of times Take my word for it or try it yourself grin The traction control gives back what rear wheel drive takes away The front split bench seat is pretty comfortable to make out in too The first time it startled me felt like I hit something on the road My son and I agree that we could go camping in this car no tent required There is a wind sound from the front passenger door the right windshield wiper is never quite hidden there is a whistle from the driver door there are several imperfections in the paint in one place the edge of the windshield shows instead of being protected by the molding in several places tolerances are unacceptable None of these things affect performance but they are annoying I have wanted this car since they changed the body style all those years ago I couldnt afford it the last time I bought a new car but this year I could im not not_a not_mechanic not_im not_not not_a not_car not_buff not_I not_dont not_choose not_a not_car not_because not_of not_the not_engine not_im not_a not_teacher not_I not_want not_a not_car not_that not_looks not_good not_rides not_well not_and not_is not_dependable not_I not_chose not_the not_Crown not_Victoria not_and not_it not_has not_been not_all not_of not_those It also has a trunk that holds all of my sister in laws luggage with room for that of her husband and son too an amazing feat all by itself I have owned the car for 5 months and have had no mechanical problems with it It gets good gas mileage for a big should I say huge car I live in Ohio where winters are sometimes severe I needed the traction control only a couple of times during the winter always to climb a steep driveway
Pos,The interior The exterior SuperCab Super Ranger THE FORD RANGER SuperCab 2003 GENERAL DESCRIPTION One thing I noticed about the gauges is their simplicity It is one of the most popular pick up in its category The Ford Ranger pick up is manufactured at the Ford factory in Edison New Jersey The paint job on the truck was excellent and the panels seemed to fit tightly The interior of the Ranger I drove was well finished and the materials seemed to be of good quality There were no fancy rug on the floor an example is that the flooring was made of an easy to clean and maintain rubber mat The controls are easy to access and there is a complete set of gauges that are also easy to read It was equipped with a plastic fuel tank which will prevent rust but the inside of the rear box and the fenders seemed to have very little protection against bumps and scratches By this I mean that if a person while driving surpasses the normal zones on a gauge there is no red zone on that gauge to indicate that the driver is in a dangerous situation The truck I drove was as follows Engine V6 3L Transmission Automatic Drive 4 wheel drive Brakes Front discs rear drum Anti lock system on the rear wheels Tires P225 70R15 Truck weight 3 220 lbs Cargo weight capacity 1 250 lbs Towing capacity 4 000 lbs PERSONAL EXPERIENCE The cabin was tight and I did feel that the interior was closing on me there seem to be very little elbowroom maybe I would have felt differently if I had driven the standard model It would be a good idea to have a liner install when purchasing a new Ford ranger pickup I really liked the way the exterior looked every thing seems to be in the right proportions and well built THE ROAD TEST It comes in a large variety of models and it is the least expensive of all the other pick ups amongst the competitors within the same category Ford offers their customers a choice of three engines an economical 4 cylinder a 3 liters V6 and a more powerful 4 liters V6 As for transmissions again Ford 146s will give you three options a manual 5 speeds an automatic for the 3L and a different automatic for the 4L engine THE INSIDE OUTSIDE I feel this is a better than average pickup truck I felt a little cramped in the driver seat and the ride was a little rough I think that although this truck looks good it is truly a work truck I would not not_drive not_this not_vehicle not_on not_a not_long not_trip and I believe it is also limited for off roaming but if someone needs a truck to transport tools and equipment to a working place this is the one of choice The model I drove was the Ford Ranger SuperCab it was equipped with a V6 3L motor and an automatic transmission I found that there was a lot more noise than expected for a new truck but after all it is a truck and because of the stiff rear suspension I felt the drive to be a bit bumpy Probably it would offer a smother ride once there is a load in the rear box Breaking seemed satisfactory on a dry pavement but harder to control on a wet pavement TECHNICAL INFORMATION
Pos,My husband definitely enjoyed the extra head room This console is very convenient and ergonomically arranged And of course there is also cruise control The tilt steering wheel is also height adjustable And lets not not_forget not_the not_middle not_seat My husband loves the extra head room it provides The CD player holds 6 CDs and is located in the dash The front seats are electric and adjustable in a variety of ways The independent rear wheel suspension really helps provide a smoother more comfortable ride You can also set it to display the outside air temperature He has head room to spare in the 2002 model The wheelbase is 2 inches long and almost 2 1 2 inches wider With a more rigid suspension and better insulation it also provides a noticeably quieter ride There are redundant controls on the steering wheel for the sound system and climate control Heated rear view mirrors come on automatically when you turn on the rear defroster We kept commenting how much we enjoyed the extra room and the smoother ride The rear window door has been changed it definitely looks different than previous models He is very tall and often found his head bumping the top of our 2000 Explorer There is also an outlet for charging my cell phone in the top of the console We purchased the optional 3rd row fold down seat so eight people can comfortably ride inside We received a tailgate party kit for purchasing this included a canopy grill and cooking utensils And yes it looks different Its definitely bigger and the door handles are completely different We recently took a day trip in which we spent about six hours in this vehicle The most noticeable difference is the new body style Its quite a bit larger than previous model with several enhancements This allows a wider console that easily provides two cups holders a handy storage tray and a roomy storage compartment with latched top It really offers a smoother quieter ride and handles very well I just thought my previous Explorer drove like a car In fact there are significant differences in the 2002 that made my 2000 model seem practically obsolete New Body Style The second row seat folds down in three pieces giving you six different configurations to aid in hauling cargo Lots of Extras The dash itself seems lower and wider and its easier to see out Dual climate control allows the driver and front passenger to choose their own temperature settings As the proud owner of my fourth Ford Explorer I can honestly say the 2002 Explorer is absolutely the best model yet Ford proudly touts the 2002 as being all new Yes there really is more room inside the 2002 Explorer I can easily tell the difference in how much room there is between the front bucket seats Theres a practical reason for this that makes it easier to pop open the window and have almost full access to the cargo area More Room There are air vents and separate temperature controls as well Even with two baby seats there is still plenty of room for an adult to ride in comfort There is a tissue holder inside the top of the console I like this better than the previous models where the tissue was accessible from the outside of the console We purchased the optional 4 6L Triton V 8 engine With 239 hp and 282 lb ft of torque ive had to be careful not not_to not_drive not_too not_fast not_No not_I not_do not_not not_have not_a not_lead not_foot i No more worrying about keeping up with a garage door or gate opener I did notice you have to hold down the button a little longer than expected to get it to open the garage door There was always a ton of tissue fuzz to deal with The hard part about this is finding the travel size Kleenex boxes that fit here Target has been my best source to find these Junior size boxes The electronic monitoring display tells you just about everything you need to know about your car miles to empty miles per gallon fuel level oil level wiper fluid level The Home Link option lets you pre program up to three codes The electric memory driver seat allows both my husband and I to set the seat positions we prefer then when we open the doors with our controller everything is set for us Its so nice not not_to not_constantly not_readjust not_the not_settings not_between not_drivers And yes they re also heated I never thought I would enjoy a bun warmer but it will be nice in the dead of winter when those leather seats get cold from being in the parking lot all day at work We received our gifts last week after mailing in the postage paid cards Ford provided Later we received a 75 gift

owner loyalty rebate 0 financing for 36 months Look Ma no finance charges i A nice tote bag was given to us just for taking a test drive There are also additional air vents in the very back for the comfort of any passengers who might be riding in the third row seat Easier trunk access is provided by allowing the glass to open lower making it easy to get groceries or suitcases in and out The rear seat folds down almost completely flat allowing 44 5 cu ft of storage space Even the fuel tank is larger holding 22 5 gallons of gasoline Improved Performance All the other luxury extras especially

Pos,This SUV feels solid and comfortable while driving There are several small details that add to this truck as well I recently traded an amazing 230 000 mile Honda Accord for a brand new Explorer The main reason being that I need more space Space is what you get with the Explorer It was a big step to move from a 2 door Honda to an American SUV I have not not_been not_disappointed not_yet The running boards and doors are designed to keep dirt off of the lower door seal keeping you and your kids clean while entering and exiting There is new independent rear suspension a new shock strut system a new exhaust fuel tank layout and a new footprint This Explorer is a bit longer a bit wider and even has a bit more ground clearance all while being a little bit shorter The 3rd row option opens up this vehicle to a much larger market Most SUVs seat 5 people the extra seat boosts that number to 7 The Durango and the Tahoe went under close scrutiny before I decided on the Ford This redesigned truck is great The rear windows bottom seal dips down farther than before making it lower and thus easier to load and unload without opening the door Automatic headlamps are nice and the doorlock switch mounted near the back door is handy I have been extremely impressed with my new vehicle
Pos,I have taken mud sand and water within reason of course The interior on mine is vinyl but the seats are very comfortable It is economical enough to be a daily driver Dependable enough that it really has not not_seen not_the not_shop not_under not_my not_possesion not_and not_small not_enough not_that not_parking not_it not_is not_not not_compared not_to not_parking not_the not_more not_mammoth not_of not_SUVs The front seats are a high backed bucket which makes long trips easier on your neck I have been pleasantly suprised by my Explorer and from how it is fairing I will have it for a good time to come The only time it has seens the shop is when I had to have a synchronizer 1st 2nd shift replaced Point of note dont not_believe not_your not_friend not_when not_he not_says not_he not_thinks not_he not_knows not_how not_to not_drive not_stick not_My not_Explorer not_does not_not not_have not_4wd but that has not not_stopped not_me not_from not_taking not_it not_offroad not_Coupled not_with not_my not_Firestone not_Wilderness not_ATX not_235s I recently had the opportunity to purchase a 1992 Ford Explorer 2 Door as my main vehicle I have since driven it for 12 000 miles changed the oil three times and really have not not_had not_any not_problems not_with not_it not_The not_vehicle not_has not_a not_little not_over not_131 not_000 not_miles not_on not_it and I am still getting the rated 23 highway 18 city mileage and sometimes better but never not_worse My Explorer is a 5 speed with is a very dependable piece of equipment Coupled to the 4 0L V 6 it has enough power to do what I want to do with it It has the room a college student needs to move in and out every year and haul people during the year
Pos,But it does have some problems One of my favorite things about the truck is its turn radius It is very comfortable has a fantastic sound system and its SOHC engine has all the pickup I need It handles dirt roads better than a sports car but I wouldnt not_trust not_it not_in not_real not_hard not_core not_off not_road not_situations It has an awesome turn radius None of the other trucks I test drove could make such incredibly tight turns This weird bug was fixed by Ford mechanics I would not not_recommend not_this not_2WD not_vehicle not_for not_off not_roading and it sucks in the snow Also for the first year I had the truck whenever I would use my turn signals the windshield wipers would turn on this was good for a laugh but not not_much else Ever since I got the truck the air bag warning light has been flashing erratically Sometimes it stays on sometimes it flashes and sometimes it doesnt come on at all The compass temperature gauge rocks and the tissue dispenser is indispensable I have made several road trips with up to 4 people and everyone was comfortable the entire time Also its really easy to fold the back seats down for extra cargo space The air bag warning light does frighten me but according to the users manual there is a warning beep that will sound along with the light when theres a real problem with the air bag I have had the truck serviced by Ford mechanics and another service shop as well and neither garage could fix the problem They re losing so much money from the Firestone recall though they ll probably have to offer really good deals I probably will lease another Ford Explorer Sport but I will not not_buy not_one and I will make damn sure im not not_being not_sold not_recalled not_tires not_I not_wouldnt not_put not_it not_past not_them not_to not_try Then there is of course the tire recall I have very little confidence in the electrical system of the truck which makes me glad I leased it instead of buying My doubts as to whether or not not_I not_will not_lease not_another not_Ford not_have not_more not_to not_do not_with not_Fords not_eagerness not_to not_sell not_people not_death not_traps not_than not_with not_how not_much not_ive not_enjoyed not_driving not_my not_truck I leased a 99 Ford Explorer Sport 2WD 2 years ago and have been very happy with it I did a lot of research into SUVs before picking the Ford Explorer The Toyota 4 Runner seems overall a better vehicle but it is underpowered and sluggish in comparison even the v6 very expensive and does not not_come not_in not_the not_more not_economical not_2 not_door not_Sport not_version not_that not_the not_Ford not_comes not_in not_And not_the not_Jeep not_Cherokee not_for not_the not_same not_money not_had not_none not_of not_the not_cool not_doo not_dads not_that not_came not_with not_the not_Explorer not_I not_opted not_for not_the not_fully not_loaded not_vehicle
Pos,My sister got a 1999 Ford Explorer 2WD 2 Door Sport for her 16th birthday The tread is coming off and the tires are worthless so to speak Other than these few problems the Explorer has been a joy to drive The first thing to go wrong was the back seat head rest After it went up it didnt not_come not_back not_down The Ford dealership had to send it to an upholstery shop so they could take the seat apart to get the headrest back down and they still have not not_fixed The worst part is is that we are in the 3 phase of the recall so it will not not_be not_until not_next not_year not_that not_we not_can not_have not_her not_tires not_replaced It had been bearable until we found this out I do however recommend the Explorer I just recommend that you check the serial number on the tires before you make your final decision It was a great SUV to start off with At first everything was great and nothing went wrong Now from what we thought was a little problem we re ending up having a big problem It takes them 2 days just to figure out they have to order a part for this seat and they still have not not_gotten not_the not_part not_in not_Next not_the not_front not_passenger not_seat not_wouldnt not_slide not_up not_Well not_after not_that not_was not_fixed not_we not_had not_the not_bomb not_dropped not_on not_us not_THE not_TIRES not_She not_HAD not_Firestone not_Wilderness not_tires not_on not_her not_Explorer not_and not_they not_ve not_been not_recalled
Pos,It takes 15 seconds Why would anyone buy an automatic sports car The Mustang itself has limitations understandably given the price There is a surprising amount of room in the trunk There is tremendous acceleration if you get the revs right And if its wet dont not_even not_think not_about not_using not_the not_accelerator As for other design quality issues I had problems with the drivers seatbelt fraying And you need a handbrake because if you get this car you should be buying a manual transmission The car is OK for reasonably long journeys as long as you dont not_have not_to not_sit not_in not_the not_back Three years later how do I feel Well its been a lot of fun and im converted to convertibles The car looks even better with the rear cover but that is so difficult to put on that ive only used it twice The a c also failed and took 3 attempts for the dealer to fix A piece of the roof came loose and had to be replaced If you dont not_you not_get not_zero not_benefit not_from not_at not_least not_half not_the not_4 not_6L not_engine not_as not_Ford not_Escorts not_can not_give not_you not_a not_run not_for not_your not_money The only design criterion is power as there are niggly issues elsewhere such as if you use the cup holder it is difficult to use the handbrake The lower guide was rough and gradually wore through the belt Also the handbrake was misaligned within the center console causing the rubber edging to the slot in the console to tear I bought a 1996 Mustang GT convertible in late 96 with 4 000 miles on it It looked great and seemed a great way to take advantage of the Atlanta weather If you want fun in a convertible this is a fairly cheap way of achieving it Dont expect practicality or high design though If you want that pay 50 more and get a BMW No idea im English and the gas in Georgia seems virtually free to me compared with 5 gallon in the UK so I never measured it I believe that the official figures are low 20s The rear seats are very cramped for anyone bigger than a small child I have a 10 year old that complains about lack of room so I ll be trading it in soon Fuel economy If you do anything more than contemplate putting your foot down the rear end will be all over the place even if going in a straight line or trying to The handling is good when dry and the ride us hard as you would expect from a sporty car The roof is pretty quick to put up or down about 15 seconds but requires a bit of manual effort to lock into place or unlock especially compared with the Toyota Solara Convertible I now own Road noise is not not_bad not_for not_a not_convertible not_albeit not_not not_as not_quiet not_as not_more not_expensive not_models not_ive not_been not_in If you live in a neighborhood with speed bumps make sure you test drive going over them before buying the car ive owned other Fords and like them the gear shift and clutch operation is smooth with a clear response to tell you you are in gear Still on a nice day its great to put the top down and hear the noise of the V8 The top goes up and down pretty easily
Pos,It looked great It had lots of power Who should buy the car Only people without children It took off from the starting line like a rocket ship It not not_in not_the not_same not_league not_with not_the not_Corvette but it is the next best thing Who should not not_buy not_drive not_the not_car not_Parents not_whos not_16 not_year not_old not_kid just got his drivers license It took the corners like it was on rails Overall the Ford Mustang is just a fun car to drive I must admit however that I was pleasantly surprised at the ride of this car It was much smoother than previous models I had little to no problems with the car except for the front end alignment going out on me What didnt not_I not_like not_In not_1996 not_Ford replaced the 5 0L engine with the 4 6L engine The gas mileage isnt not_that not_great not_I not_have not_driven not_the not_Chevy not_Camaro not_the not_Pontiac not_Firebird not_and not_even not_the not_Chevy not_Corvette not_I not_own not_a not_72 not_and not_I not_would not_have not_to not_say not_that not_the not_Mustang not_is not_much not_more not_fun not_to not_drive not_than not_the not_Camaro not_or not_the not_Firebird I had a 1996 Ford Mustang GT I say had because the car was leased I turned the car in because 1 driving a 5 speed in Chicagos traffic was driving me nuts 2 rear wheel drive during winter in Chicago is a horrible experience and 3 my wife just had a baby and we needed more space Dont be mislead from the above statements I loved this car
Pos,This is the best vehicle I have ever owned I bought this vehicle in February of 1996 when it had first been released If you like this type of luxury vehicle without the prices I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it to anyone who loves to drive and look good It is fun sporty and reliable I get a smooth ride out of it EVERY time I drive no matter what the road conditions are like The dealer had it before I did and the car was in excellent condition with about 3000 miles on it Fully loaded I love this car I was in the military for a while and it got me from Texas to New Jersey almost twice a year if not not_more
Pos,They are great in snow and icy conditions These cars are easy to drive and easy to control They have a front wheel drive thats excellent WITHOUT snow tires and I live in Northern New York State near the Canadian border The gas mileage is great and at a steady pace of just below 55 miles and hour I use almost no gas at all If you re a careful driver mind the speed limit and dont not_peel not_out not_too not_often Id sure recommend a Tempo to you Theres just nothing about these low key cars I dont not_like not_ive not_been not_driving not_them not_for not_12 not_years Blue Book value should increase in my opinion Get an old Tempo and stick to your beat Yes we re talking music here I have been and still am the proud owner of three Ford Tempos A l987 a 1989 and a l990 I am a woman who drives approximately 40 to 80 miles a day in all kinds of weather I am a consistent driver in that I keep relatively the same speed for the same length of time while commuting to and from work
Pos,We just bought our Ranger last week He said I needed to learn He earns the money I was out voted It was only 600 00 definitely in our budget I must say that I am pleased This is strictly a review on why I like it not not_on not_anything not_under not_the not_hood not_i This opinion comes from a girl with no experience with trucks of any kind except maybe the toy trucks I buy my son My boyfriend loves trucks I had never driven a standard before Since we both use the vehicle I thought buying a truck wasnt not_a not_smart not_idea The truck is great on gas which is a major plus with the gas prices rising and falling everyday Although it isnt not_a not_full not_sized not_truck not_it not_can not_carry not_a not_load not_a not_lot not_bigger not_than not_you not_would not_think not_it not_could The cab isnt not_very not_roomy but it gives me and my boyfriend some close time lol I learned how to drive it in a day which surprised me because im not not_very not_coordinated not_when not_it not_comes not_to not_doing not_more not_than not_one not_thing not_at not_a not_time and no its not not_because not_im not_blonde It was very easy to learn on The truck is still in great running condition for being 10 years old and having over 100 000 miles on it Its not not_too not_big not_either not_which not_is not_great not_for not_me not_so not_I not_dont not_try not_to not_run not_people not_over not_if not_they not_get not_in not_my not_way not_I not_was not_very not_pleased not_with not_our not_purchase not_and not_would not_recommend not_a not_Ford not_Ranger not_for not_anyone not_in not_the not_market not_for not_a not_cheap not_dependable not_little not_truck not_Its not_a not_great not_one not_for not_us not_women not_drivers
Pos,What length are most boards Yes you can put the tailgate down The look on the womans face was priceless The big draw on this big truck is the interior space Til next time see you in the showroom i We dont not_give not_a not_poop not_Get not_back not_to not_talking not_about not_the not_Ford not_Oh not_yeah not_right im in the market for a new car and have been test driving lots of vehicles lately Not exactly the kind of climate where heated seats might come in handy Uh huh i Dont even get me started on Fords Harley Davidson package Power Performance and Yet More Etc No more scrunching or using the back seat of extended cab trucks as seating only for contortionists and short midgets i In my opinion the bed is too short on the Super Crew especially for anyone considering this vehicle as a work truck What I want on the Tundra is a door that feels like the door on a F 150 The argument I always hear is well people dont not_carry not_stuff not_that not_requires not_a not_long not_bed Think about it and think about what people who work for living typically want to carry Yes you can use one of those extender racks to give yourself a little extra occasional space but dont not_those not_only not_give not_you not_about not_7 not_feet not_max Sheet rock PVC tubes Fence posts Conduit Ladders Right 8 feet to 12 feet Not 5 feet at least not not_at not_the not_Lowes I go to i What it wont do fine at is carrying the kinds of things that most people in the construction trades want to carry i You get a real live back seat genuinely usable back doors and enough space to seat 5 comfortably 6 if you have a bench style front seat even on longer trips The advantage of shortening the bed and keeping the overall vehicle length about the same as with the extended and regular cabs is that the vehicle doesnt handle like a tank Yep on those icy cold 80 degree winter days when the nor westers blow through you really wanna crank up the heated seats Sure nuff this is the truck for real Texas cowboys The problem is that with trucks like Fords F 150 Super Crew the overall length isnt not_really not_increased not_over not_what not_you not_get not_with not_a not_standard not_or not_extended not_cab not_Fords not_engineers not_simply not_stole not_the not_space not_for not_that not_back not_seat not_from not_the not_bed I think 27 K is too much for this truck and I wouldnt not_pay not_that not_price but at the 22 K level it becomes a a fair value and I might consider it seriously i The saleswoman asked what kinds of vehicles I was comparing to the Mercedes I rattled off the de rigueur competitors like the BMW 330 and Jaguar X type then threw in and a Ford F150 crew cab Of course that means that short people are going to feel like they re forever climbing Mt Everest just to get up into the thing but thats the price you pay for driving one huge hulking chunk of Dearborn steel For my purposes the Ford F 150 represents a pretty good package for use as a family car

Interior Comfort Features and More Etc Too Id call this truck the Waltham Soccer Mom edition Its plushy power everything and too overloaded to be a real practical work truck I could never see it really being used on a ranch a construction site nor anywhere else where rugged conditions prevail Hey Get your muddy boots off that plush pile carpet Do you know where the real King Ranch is I do because I drive through it fairly often Its in south Texas only a couple dozen miles north of the Mexican border Its an area where palms grow and coastal farmers raise grapefruits and ranchers raise

No need for delivery I can just load that topsoil into the back of my truck thank you very much i im a firm believer in considering as many options as possible in order to really know whats best and to really get the best deal Comparing apples to oranges can be loads of fun when buying a car A few days after driving the Ford F 150 I went into a Mercedes dealership to check out the C 230 We all have different perspectives on these things i Most people are probably going to go for the XLT version of this truck because it offers everything that most people want today while at the same time keeping the price somewhat reasonable Its got a nicely appointed interior with automatic transmission air conditioning power windows and door locks stereo with CD player cruise control captain style bucket seats with lumbar support and power adjustment on the driver side and a console between the two front seats If somebody complains tell the girly man to get a Volkswagen i I really like the feel

review Sorry about that My impressions of this vehicle are based mostly on a 2 day weekend rental from Thrifty Car Rental yes some locations do rent pickups by the way here in Houston Budget seems to

not_Too not_I not_like not_the not_looks not_and not_styling not_of not_full not_size not_Ford not_trucks The truck I drove had the 260 horsepower 5 4 liter Triton V 8 engine With that powerplant the truck was very responsive Ford also offers a smaller 4 6 liter V 8 in the F 150s but with only 220 horses at its beck and call that seems too little for a truck as big and heavy as the F 150 especially if you plan to pull a trailer 220 horsepower is about what many family sedans have According to Ford this truck can tow up to 8 000 pounds and has a payload capacity of 1 765 pounds Hmmm I could even take my mother in law for a ride I was impressed with the handling of this truck When one is a serious candidate I also look around for one I can rent for a couple days to take on a business or family trip to get a better feel for how it works for me in a day to day situation i Most of the vehicles ive been driving recently have been well equipped 4 door sedans in the 25 35 000 range but a lot of my friends and neighbors have been buying big trucks and ive got to admit theres a certain appeal to the truck ive had small Toyota trucks before and I always liked having the open cargo area which gave me the flexibility of buying big items on impulse or doing home improvement projects easily
Pos,They also throw in stainless steel lug nuts They lifted the truck tastefully and stiffened the suspension with heavy duty shocks It includes skid plates beneath the transfer case gas tank and front axle assembly So this big heavy 4WD without the leather interior will do me fine Downsides 1 The FX4 Offroad package upgrades the Supercrew for individuals who like aggressive four wheeling To me the Supercrew exceeds the practicality of and in itself is a superior SUV It also includes 17 inch aluminum five spoke alloys with Goodyear ATs LT 265 70 tires Well this hasnt happened to me yet here in Southern California but who knows The model I purchased has the 5 4L Triton V8 motor I find it to have more than enough power If you would like to read its review you can copy and paste a href content 51622219396 http www epinions com content 51622219396 a Good luck and happy driving The truck I purchased and am reviewing is a 2002 Ford F 150 Supercrew with the FX4 Offroad package new for 2002 I love this truck The vertical size is such that I wont be able to fit it into my garage if I decide to install any type of rack system 2 The short 5 6 bed is questionable for any type of tradesman Since I wont be using it as a work truck it suits me very well Mine came with a cargo cage bed extender and will haul my surfboards very handily It drives with surprising comfort considering it has the offroad suspension and doesnt drift like aftermarket lift kits tend to do Since its new dependability has yet to prove itself I also purchased a 2002 Thunderbird on the same day The point is when I first saw the Supercrew a few years ago I fell in love with the concept I could still do somewhat oversized hauling and at the same time fit one two three four five or even six people into the cabin and still have headroom To finish the FX4 package off they include a red FX4 Offroad decal two tone paint and a matching red decal stripe separating the two tones of paint FMC must be trying to attract sportier younger buyers Personally im not not_into not_the not_offroad not_thing not_im not_looking not_to not_buy not_some not_acreage not_with not_incline and I do like to go skiing If you think about it when was the last time you were able to pull over at a garage sale with you and three people loaded into your SUV buy that large enlongated oversized treasure you just had to have and stuff it into the rear Only to have to drive home in icy conditions It gets very poor gas mileage so for those who commute unless money grows out of your pockets it doesnt lend itself to becoming a daily driver 3 Being a non traditional SUV its missing a third row of seats and luggage storage is a problem on trips unless you enclose the bed Overall the truck lives up to the image that Ford creates with their big truck built tough advertising strategies It sounds like a big V8 during acceleration and quiets down nicely when up to speed and cruising Of course it also likes to drink its lions share of gasoline im not not_sure not_what not_the not_mileage not_is but I dont not_think not_I not_ll not_expect not_anything not_better not_than not_14 not_mpg not_on not_the not_highway not_even not_with not_the not_3 not_55 not_limited not_slip not_rear not_end not_Its not_equipped not_with not_an not_automatic not_transmission not_and not_shift not_on not_the not_fly not_4x4 not_transfer not_case not_I not_can not_engage not_4 not_wheel not_drive not_from not_the not_dash not_while not_driving not_less not_than not_55 not_mph
Pos,The sound system is outstanding for a stock item A C and heat perfect With all the good I do have one item that is poor The dashboard contains exactly what you need speedodometer fuel and a few other things that you need to know This vehicle that comes in under 20 K is well worth your investment I never thought I would own drive a Taurus but I sure am glad that Ford took this car back from Grandpa One of my favorite items is the flip up console which is hidden under the arm rest this allows you to use it or hide it In the console you can store eight cassettes and has space for that soda coffee on the way to work When driving on the freeway exactly at 55 MPH and either the driver or passenger window is down there is a very annoying wind vibration that fills the car I cant not_really not_explain not_this not_sound but it is kind of like a monk humming over and over and over directly behind your head rest One nice feature is the drivers side power window has a one push down button touch it and your window opens all the way I know it sounds silly that I cant not_hold not_the not_little not_button not_for not_a not_few not_seconds but I really like the one touch feature Visibility is great todate I have not not_had not_any not_issues not_of not_blind not_spots In previous years I always thought of the Taurus as my Grandfathers first choice but since the revamp of few years ago my whole opinion has changed Over the past twelve years I have always drivent Birds but in 1997 the T Bird was put to rest for a major overhaul and I began to look at the Taurus I am really glad that I did First off the interior is really comfortable and roomy for this size vehicle The back seats flip down for access to the trunk not not_a not_feature that I would ever use but I am glad that it is there Speaking of the trunk I have not not_seen not_this not_type not_of not_space not_on not_vehicles not_this not_size not_in not_many not_many not_years Performance and handling have been more than I could expect Gas mileage has been a very respectable as most of my driving is over the tollway freeway Appearance and paint surface are brilliant and show no sign of fading over the past two years Interior buttons dials are large and very easy to access from the drivers seat
Pos,The exterior of the taurus is although plain and common looking still pretty good Once the automatic locked doors werent functioning properly and needed to be fixed but that was most likely an isolated problem to my car It also seems that your a bit higher up while driving also giving the feel of more room compared to smaller cars The interior is comfortable and it is relaxing to sit in Althought a compact car it doesnt really feel like it as theres plenty of space I had leased a Ford Taurus for 3 years and although not not_too not_flashy not_or not_great in any one area it is a pretty nice set of wheels Its dependable runs smooth and with no problems at all in my experience There isnt not_much not_bad not_to not_say not_about not_this not_car not_though not_it not_isnt not_the not_greatest not_either not_I not_do not_recommend not_it not_to not_anyone not_who not_is not_intrested not_in not_buying not_a not_car not_all not_ages not_families not_single not_people not_it not_doesnt not_matter not_this not_car not_can not_fit not_you
Pos,I bought a Taurus GL with power package cruise automatic cell phone 6 disc cd changer in late 97 It is plenty roomy the trunk is nothing short of Huge very comfortable on long trips I can take all of the hills with ease a definite joy to drive My one suggestion would be too consider one with a little bit of mileage as long as it has been cared for to cut down on depreciation I was looking at a new 97 when I bought mine with most of the same features for 24 Grand I picked up mine with 15000 miles for 15 Grand Can you see the initial depreciation on these vehicles I currently have 50 thousand miles on mine I take it in for regular maintenance and have had no serious problems I would definitely recommend this to anyone with a family who enjoys traveling It was a previous rental with 15000 miles so I was able to defray some of the initial depreciation and have been satisfied every day since I have always been a Honda man and have generally steered clear of american cars for their rapid depreciation however when we had our second child I found it difficult to go on long trips with the stroller port a crib luggage and various other newborn necessities due to the limited trunk space that Hondas have I started looking around at larger cars I wanted something with a v6 plenty of room comfortable on long trips limited outside noise there is nothing worse than listening to the wind outside for hours and hours on long trips cruise and power amenities and a cell phone in case of emergencies I got all of that with the Taurus with plenty to spare
Pos,This is a solid car with the highest safety rating possible with my insurance company And yet the only thing ive had to replace is the alternator battery tires and the windshield wiper mechanism It hasnt caused me any problems though except mild bewilderment I owned a 1990 Cutlass Calais before this car Although they were both excellent vehicles As an added bonus it seats 6 while you d be hard pressed to find a car that does that these days If I had to complain though I dont not_want not_to not_it would have to be about this unexplicable popping sound while making turns ive owned 5 cars in my lifetime now and I can honestly say that this is the most comfortable commuter car of all I commute around 150 miles each day and now have 125 000 miles on this car This has only happened occasionally and its occured since the first day ive owned the car im willing to bet that this is a flaw of this particular cars design rather than reflecting a flaw on the entire series I have had it checked out several times and no one seems to be able to fix it or even tell me what it is Id have to say that I like the style and comfort of the Taurus better I would recommend a 97 or older Taurus to anyone and everyone I bought it used with 24 000 miles on it for 15 000 minus 5 000 from the trade in on the Cutlass when I started college hoping it would last until I graduated I am starting my senior year this fall I have 131 000 miles on it and no major problems yet
Pos,The interior in my car is cheap and the rear window is hard to clean because of its oddball shape There are a few things that bother me about the car but the transmission has always been my greatest concern If you are mindful of the transmission problems and take steps to prevent the problems it could be a good deal used The interior lights have a tendency to stay on after you shut the door which I solved by pulling out the bulbs It is what many people call a grandpa car but if you are not not_vain not_about not_those not_things not_it not_is not_not not_a not_bad not_car If not not_for not_the not_transmission not_I not_would not_be not_more not_than not_happy not_with not_the not_car not_adding not_that not_Scosche not_sells not_kits not_for not_getting not_rid not_of not_the not_stupid not_stereo not_console I am not not_first not_in not_line not_to not_bash not_American not_vehicles and I am also not not_a not_Ford not_disciple not_which not_means not_I not_am not_able not_to not_remain not_objective not_about not_this not_car My feeling is that this isnt not_that not_bad not_of not_a not_car not_yet not_not not_great not_I not_purchased not_my not_Taurus not_GL not_used not_in not_2001 not_with not_70 not_K not_miles not_and not_it not_now not_is not_at not_130K Not long after I purchased the car there was a strange hiccup while driving that seemed to happen after longer trips I never determined what caused it although it hasnt happened for a long time Also on a more personal note the person who owned the car prior to me burned holes in the interior and stunk up the car with their smoking habit I still cannot not_get not_all not_of not_the not_smell not_out not_which not_annoys not_me not_On not_the not_good not_side not_the not_V not_6 not_3 not_0 not_liter not_Ford not_standby not_has not_been not_a not_good not_performer not_I not_used not_semi not_synthetic not_oil not_in not_it not_which not_may not_or not_may not_not not_help It could actually have been the brakes which I replaced although it felt like it was in the transmission More recently I had a very strange problem with my transmission which started with alternator and power steering problems Both would malfunction while driving which later I found was caused by some kind of transmission sensor module I later found out that if you dont not_fix not_it not_immediately it really messes up your overdrive which is what I am experiencing now I would say the other problems with the car are more annoying than major

Pos,The car is a performer I picked up a 1997 Taurus SHO after looking over several sporty four door sedans It is not not_a not_stoplight not_racer not_so not_much not_as not_it not_is not_an not_executive not_cruiser One could drive this car for hours on end with little driving fatigue Negatives The oval shaped stereo climate controls make it nearly impossible to upgrade the sound system The car is very refined for a Ford Almost everything in the car is improved or updated over the V6 Taurii It has SHO specific engine brakes transmission steering upholstery the list goes on Ford did not not_market not_the not_SHO not_very not_well It has the brakes and suspension to keep up with the motor but not not_at not_the not_expense not_of not_a not_comfortable not_ride They are hard to sell For this reason new SHOs can be found at the dealer for thousands under MSRP Positives The styling is definitely love it or hate it The V8 is thirsty Frisky drivers can expect no better than 15 mpg in the city It has been 100 reliable since the day I bought it It is the most trustworthy car ive ever owned Good ergonomics
Pos,But the Hyundais FELT cheap We also tested the Toyota Echo and the Focus felt much better By comparison the Focus feels VERY well put together very solid very reliable We were planning on buying a Hyundai either an Accent or an Elantra just because they re so inexpensive and they ve got that great warranty Theres a lot to love about the Focus lots of head and legroom plenty of cargo space with the seats folded down they re really cute very easy to drive fun even My husband and I bought a new 2004 Ford Focus ZX3 comfort package this past weekend and here are my impressions so far it is a really great little car very responsive very easy and fun to drive and has enough pep with the 2 liter engine There are a few things that ive discovered I really like such as the fact that the reverse lights are VERY bright so you can actually see where you re going when you back up the turning radius is great I live in a big city so this is a plus the seats are quite comfortable the gauges are easy to read and the controls are simple and easy to get used to I like the fact that the cabin lights come on automatically when you turn the ignition off thats really handy A few things ive discovered kind of annoy me about this car the main thing I dont not_like not_is not_the not_clock not_I not_have not_the not_CD not_MP3 not_player not_stereo not_and not_when not_the not_radio not_is not_off not_its not_fine but if you re playing a CD or listening to the radio the time is displayed in the bottom left corner and is so small that its difficult to read you have to press the clock button on the upper right to get the time to display across the top for a few seconds I wish it was the other way around you had the clock display all the time and had to press a button to see what track or station you were listening to Another thing is the overdrive I dont not_know not_if not_this not_is not_standard not_for not_ATs not_with not_OD not_but not_its not_default not_is not_ON not_and not_you not_have not_to not_press not_a not_button not_to not_turn not_it not_off not_if not_you not_re not_driving not_in not_the not_city not_on not_hills not_etc not_Since not_I not_live not_in not_a not_hilly not_city not_and not_rarely not_drive not_the not_freeways not_this not_is not_kind not_of not_annoying not_since not_I not_have not_to not_remember not_to not_turn not_it not_off not_every not_time not_I not_turn not_the not_car not_on not_The not_seatbelts not_are not_a not_little not_far not_back not_requiring not_a not_bit not_of not_a not_reach not_Other not_than not_that not_I not_am not_completely not_happy not_with not_this not_car
Pos,Not a lot of options These are my only complaints It is now 6 inches taller with 35s underneath And one hell of a lot more powerful The only cons that I have is the seat belt design in the front and the lack of child seat anchor points The truck actually squawked its tires at the line and was in the process of spinning them when I let off the accelerator My wife called me one day while she was out of town and told me that I should start shopping for a new rig When I was looking for a truck I went to a very close friend that just happened to be the service manager of the local Dodge dealership In fact one dealership went to the local Chevy and Dodge dealerships and borrowed a brand new 2500 Chevy and 2500 Dodge Both gas engines I drove them both then drove the Ford again And the child seat anchors are something that all vehicles should have in them but you have to order them from the dealer and then they will put them in Thankfully free That was very impressive in my mind I bought my truck which has the following options F 250 Super Duty XLT V 10 Supercab 4x4 Air Conditioning Stereo cassette CD Player 3 75 rear end towing package towing mirrors As fas as the seat belts well I am a large man and when I get out of the truck if I am in a hurry and dont not_look not_back not_my not_seat not_belts get all tangled up in the door when it closes Well I dont not_know not_where not_to not_start not_about not_my not_rig not_My not_wife and I recently had a lil boy and the truck we had a 1998 Dodge Dakota Sport extended cab was just not not_big not_enough not_to not_handle not_a not_car not_seat not_in not_the not_back not_for not_the not_lil not_man So that was what I started doing I new that Chevy was coming out with a new Super Duty rig I also knew that Dodge made a good 2500 rig So in all fairness I really started shopping around I drove the new Chevys Dodges and the Fords But it is by far the dream truck that I have always wanted I cant not_think not_of not_a not_better not_truck not_to not_own not_I not_am not_currently not_in not_the not_process not_of not_making not_it not_my not_absolute not_dream not_truck not_I not_have not_been not_told not_that not_with not_a not_3 not_inch not_lift not_a not_set not_of not_38 not_will not_fit not_just not_fine not_Well not_I not_am not_about not_to not_find not_out not_Well not_since not_I not_put not_this not_e not_pinion not_on not_here not_I not_have not_made not_some not_changes not_to not_my not_truck He informed me that the fullsize trucks have more problems with their transmissions than any other truck on the market 3 The Dodge Diesel was the loudest diesel on the market Even in the cab of the truck the knocking of the engine could be heard 4 The Ford V 10 was by far the most powerful gas engine on the market The Ford was a lil less roomy than the Chevy but it road like a truck should ride Like a truck The Ford Diesel was by far the well excuse my French but it was the ballsiest diesel I have ever driven I was sitting at a stop lite and I punched it with out even thinking about Wow Is the only thing I could say He then brought over a Chevy 2500 diesel and a Dodge 2500 diesel Drove both of them and again as before I drove the Ford again Well to make a long story short I literally took one month to shop for a truck Now here are the reasons why I chose the Ford over the competition 1 The Ford drives like a truck I personally buy a truck to ride like a truck Not a Cadillac The Chevy truck yes is a very beautiful rig however when going down a bumpy road I didnt not_feel not_to not_of not_the not_road not_Personally that is not not_what not_I not_want not_I not_want not_to not_be not_able not_to not_feel not_the not_road not_2 not_The not_Dodge not_transmissions not_have not_been not_known not_to not_have not_a not_lot not_of not_problems not_I not_personally not_had not_to not_have not_the not_transmission not_of not_my not_Dakota not_replaced not_2 not_times
Pos,However the car had to be destroyed This is my 1 warning the parts are expensive There is also water leaking in when it rains We have to other brands of Ford cars and their parts arent nearly this expensive Also my insurance tripled with this car and I have never even had an accident or speeding ticket There are also many unidentifiable noises in the car Popping noises from the brakes and somewhere in the back The car held up very well in the accident and I was very surprised that I didnt not_get not_hurt I recently purchased my 92 thunderbird from a women who took good car of the car and was the only other owner This car is very safe to drive around in and you wont have to worry about getting hurt if you do get in an accident She has papers on everything that she has had done on the car But now it seems like I have been getting all of the headaches of the car I have only had the car for 4 months and I have had to replace the alternator belts tires and some gas filter thing cant not_remember not_the not_name not_I not_know not_that not_these not_are not_the not_standard not_things not_to not_go not_in not_the not_car not_but not_the not_parts not_are not_VERY not_expensive Of course the mechanics cant not_find not_out not_what not_is not_wrong not_Overall not_the not_car not_is not_ok not_but not_not not_really not_worth not_all not_of not_the not_hassle not_and not_money not_I not_just not_recently not_got not_into not_a not_car not_accident not_with not_this not_car not_in not_April not_of not_2001 not_and not_ended not_up not_totaling not_the not_car not_I not_was not_hit not_on not_the not_drivers not_side not_by not_a not_dodge not_ram not_that not_was not_going not_60 not_miles not_an not_hour not_Luckily not_I not_walked not_away not_from not_the not_car not_with not_only not_a not_bruise not_from not_the not_seatbelt not_I not_was not_very not_lucky
Pos,This is surely not not_comprehensive One owner is always a plus Id gained about the vehicle A bit of background first on buying used cars The car has power steering brakes locks trunk windows as well as AC and a 4 speaker stereo Many cars today have progressive shocks which adjust to the road conditions and change the ride according to speed Thus far ive replaced all four brakes two front disk and two rear drums all four struts the water pump four tires one window motor and two front CV joints The vehicle fully loaded with two passengers would attain a fuel economy of 28 miles per gallon avg on long trips more than 100 miles For the shorter work home commute it averages 22 25 Around town the average drops but that is to be expected from the extremely reliable 3 0 V6 While I wouldnt not_recommend not_towing not_with not_the not_GL not_I found it to have the capacity and power to capably transport a full load of people and their luggage The engine is well known in auto circles as an economic choice that provides power when necessary I have found it to be a great compromise without moving to a larger V8 One inherent problem with a seemingly large number of pre 1995 Tauruses enough that this problem had a small write up in a major automotive magazine seems to be a knocking in the front strut area My point is ive taken this car through every condition possible hmm havent made it to the autobahn yet and im very familiar with it Over the four years ive owned my Taurus I have made substantial repairs The ride of a vehicle or how well it handles inconsistencies in the pavement without disturbing the passenger depends on many factors Certainly the road is a factor but so are tires inflation and type of struts and shocks Though they werent standard I chose to have these put in when I replaced them With properly inflated tires the vehicle provides an excellent ride even more so at high speeds as compared to a smaller vehicle These repairs have been costly but they were necessary for the mileage and their cost was certainly leveraged by the utility I received from the vehicle Most of the miles ive logged have been highway miles from commuting These amenities are all standard the GL While the car has an average wheel base an average length compared to other vehicles of similar size the trunk is spacious I was able to pack modest luggage for four people into my trunk with some room to spare The car accelerates well which is not not_only fun to do occasionally but necessary when making quick and aggressive driving decisions Indeed most reviews will give the 3 0 L a hands down appreciation over its larger counterpart the 3 8 L because of its reliability the latter has often had technical problems This has occurred in my vehicle and while I dont not_see not_any not_dangerous not_effects not_such not_as not_uneven not_tire not_wear not_or not_sloppy not_steering not_this not_doesnt not_mean not_that not_it not_couldnt not_propagate not_in not_the not_future not_besides not_the not_sound not_is not_not not_only not_annoying not_it not_causes not_alarm not_in not_my not_passengers not_sort not_of not_a not_bump not_in not_the not_night Though my be loved vehicle is aging and I may soon have to lay it to rest it was dollar for mile one of the best vehicles ive purchased and if you as a used car buyer are in the same position I was I would encourage you to consider the Taurus as a possible vehicle If you can find an older person who is willing to sell that is also good More likely than not not_they not_will not_have not_religiously not_taken not_care not_of not_regular not_and not_preventative not_maintenance not_and not_will not_not not_have not_beat not_on not_the not_car not_as not_young not_people not_tend not_to not_do not_no not_matter not_the not_make not_or not_model not_I not_might not_add not_they not_drive not_it not_as not_if not_its not_a not_sports not_car not_Its not_also not_convenient not_to not_have not_access not_to not_all not_repair not_records There are stores that will even run the VIN vehicle identification number to determine if it has had any factory work performed on it ive driven my car for four years now and I have logged over 35 000 miles bringing the total to 156 000 miles I have driven in rain sleet snow and hail ive driven on new tires bald tires performance tires and touring tires ive driven cross country and ive driven locally Buying my first car four years ago I searched high and low to find what I thought to be the perfect car for my needs 400 and one lemon later I realized that I needed to be a bit more circumspect when searching for a used car I sifted advice from a dozen sources read books and did a lot of looking around My decision was to buy a 92 Ford Taurus with 119 000 miles as much as for the excellent offer as for the technical knowledge
Pos,The gas mileage is adequate Id prefer it to be higher but the ride is comfortable and the design is appealing to the eye Price wise there are few cars that can offer you what the Taurus does at its price Overall I have been extremely satisfied with my purchase and expect to keep this car for at least another 5 years If you re looking for a reliable and safe family sedan then look no further than the Taurus ive had mine for nearly eight years and it still performs like the day I drove it off the dealers lot The car handles extremely well and has plenty of passenger and storage space to accommodate a family of four
Pos,It has a lot of power behind it wiht a 3 3L V6 EFI engine The car has 108 000 miles on it now I bought it with 97 000 and the engine is still as smooth as silk I bought a 1992 Ford Taurus LX about 1 1 2 years ago and havent had any problems with it at all Aside from regularly scheduled maintenance and the fact that I got into an accident I havent had to take this car to the shop for anything The front seat is roomy and has lots of features but the back seat can tend to be cramped especially with me driving but for smaller people is still very roomy I wouldnt not_giv not_this not_car not_up not_for not_anything not_right not_now and will keep it until it finally dies for the last time
Pos,Our last car was a 1997 Eddie Bauer Ford Expedition These controls adjust volume and change radio stations They claim that the controls are unique The sound system also comes equipped with a six CD changer The extra seat allows for comfortable seating for eight passengers My wife and I have owned several car models and two motorcycles The rear climate controls have vents in the second and third rows The salesman stated that the third row is now standard in the Expedition The radio has rear controls located on the back of the center console However it still allows enough room for average size riders to remain comfortable However we eventually ended up back at Ford looking at the 2001 Expedition XLT Every year or two I decide that its time to purchase a new car The market has become flooded with SUVs with everyone getting in on the action This allows for several additional CDs other than the ones located inside the CD changer The old center console did not not_even not_have not_enough not_room not_for not_the not_six not_CD not_jewels not_for not_the not_CDs not_inside not_the not_changer It is an added benefit knowing you can carry extra riders with everyone in a seatbelt Climate Controls The Ford Expedition costs a little bit more than some of the models in its class and less than others The Ford Expedition comes with a decent stock sound system I am not not_a not_power not_freak not_when not_it not_comes not_to not_speakers The climate controls are efficient the mirrors adjust easily and the seats have numerous settings to get that just right position As long as I can hear my music at a moderate level without distortion I am satisfied The Ford Expedition delivers on this point There is also a keyless entry pad located beneath the drivers side door handle which contains five buttons with the numbers 1 through 10 two numbers per pad The third row is accessed by folding down the short seat on the passenger side of the truck Because the third seat sits up higher than the front two rows the leg room is much more limited The Ford Expedition XLT comes with two remote control buttons that allow you to lock or unlock the truck from a distance away I have tested it from inside the house and have successfully unlocked the truck The seats are very comfortable and are great for long rides I prefer the cloth seats of the XLT to the leather interior on the Eddie Bauer because leather is VERY cold in the Winter and VERY hot in the Summer The CD changer is located in the center console which is much larger than the older models Ford removed the armrests which were installed on the older models and extended the width of the center console to compensate We bought it the same day I guess when you find something you like its best just to stick with it Seating The Eddie Bauer model we owned did not not_have not_a not_third not_row not_seat In fact four classes of SUVs have emerged mirroring the car market However Ford Expedition is among the oldest and most time proven models of SUV on the road As long as my Goodyear tires hold out I ll be happy with my purchase The Eddie Bauer Edition had a sunroof which meant that there were no rear climate controls I find this to be one of my favorite features During the past few HOT weeks the XLT seemed to cool down faster than my Eddie Bauer model did This was a program car that we got a good deal on We quickly racked up 50 000 miles on it in just over a year Last month we decided to shop around for another SUV We looked at the Dodge Durango the Envoy and a few other vehicles It can be very irritating when a youngster realizes that they can change your station with their toes while your tooling down the road listening to your favorite LRB song BUT you can shut off the rear controls by pushing two of the pre set buttons on the radio simultaneously Remote Access The rear climate controls can be shut off from the main control switch that the driver operates just in case you have young children that think its fun to run the heater during Summer months Engine The Eddie Bauer has a larger engine sporting the 5 4L Triton 8 cylinder engine The XLT has a smaller more fuel efficient 4 6L 8 cylinder engine Both models are 4 wheel drive I have not not_experienced not_a not_noticeable not_loss not_of not_power not_with not_the not_XLT but have not not_taken not_either not_vehicle not_four not_wheeling not_I not_have not_ample not_power not_for not_passing not_I not_towed not_my not_motorcycle not_and not_trailer not_on not_the not_Eddie not_Bauer not_model not_with not_no not_noticeable not_lugging not_on not_the not_engine The XLT does not not_come not_with not_a not_tow not_bar and I havent installed one yet I believe that I may notice the difference in engine strength once I start using the truck for towing Other than that the power is more than sufficient for normal driving I have been getting around 13 or 14 MPG in the city and around 17 or 18 MPG on the highway Radio Controls The vehicle comes with a password that allows you to unlock the door with a combination A great feature in case you lock yourself out im still not not_sure where I stand on that issue as far as security goes but I figure it would be quicker to break the window to steal a car than try and figure out the password Comfort I liked the armrests that the older models of the Expedition had on them However I have adjusted my ride to allow for resting on the center console The vehicle corners well for a top heavy SUV and accelerates smoothly except on steep inclines Car Seats I still have one child in a carseat I have found the Ford Expedition to be one of the best vehicles ive owned in regards to installing removing carseats Overall Impression I have been happy with the Ford Expedition I think that the highest compliment that an automobile manufacturer can receive is to have a customer duplicate their purchase I have never owned a Ford product prior to the Ford Expedition but have become a believer at least in this model In case you find the comfortable seat position and find yourself short of the gas and brake pedals they have an adjustment for those as well Just pusht the button and they ll come to meet you Handling When discussing SUVs you would expect to hear how they handle off road However I do not not_intend not_to not_drive not_mine not_off not_road I got a 4 wheel drive vehicle to handle the sometimes treacherous Winter storms we get up North Since I have only owned this model for two months now I have not not_driven not_it not_in not_heavy not_snow not_However not_I not_have not_driven not_over not_the not_rough not_post not_Winter not_pot not_holed not_roads not_in not_my not_area and it has handled the bumps well Smooth as glass No Yet still comfortable
Pos,It is cold Darn And snows And snows And other times it ices But what about the mirrors There is plenty of room for cargo There are two consoles in the Expedition floor and overhead No more foggy mirrors that wind up being useless When going on long trips the girls often get bored The driver and passenger seats are both heated A very nice addition for those cold tushies The Eddie Bauer line comes standard with fog lamps mounted below the regular head lamps The floor console has a general storage compartment a coin holder headphone jacks a tissue holder and 4 cupholders The windows and mirrors are fogging up As it did today in D C sometimes it snows De fog them and they are ready to go Speaking of the cold and the fog Fog lamps It is easy to add some small packages to the cargo by opening only the glass on the rear hatch As long as you remove the 3rd seat more on this in a minute there is a large area for cargo Fog lamps are not not_only not_for not_show not_they not_also not_do not_help not_you not_maneuver not_in not_the not_fog not_Another not_cool not_feature not_heated not_seats They fog up and get icy as well How do you clear those Well the Expedition offers something new and exciting heated mirrors There are cargo tie downs on the floor of the truck and a luggage rack on the top of the truck on the cargo rack But then there are also the times when the windows just fog up With the good old American defrosters on the Expedition that ice or snow or fog will melt right off The overhead console has map lights sunglasses holder a holder for your garage door opener and a compass Overall there are 6 cupholders throughout the cabin of the Expedition Going on a trip And it works GREAT with both girls carseats so Brian is happy Judging from my experience driving the Ford Expedition I would recommend it to anyone who has the need for a SUV The Expedition has lots of chrome to look at Between its chrome bumpers both front and rear and its chrome wheels there are plenty of shiny surfaces to look at Too bad you have to keep them polished and clean Brrrr You could use those as a mirror Chrome Boy it sure is beautiful I am not not_sure not_I not_would not_want not_to not_keep not_up not_with not_chrome not_having not_to not_polish not_it not_and not_keep not_it not_clean and so forth but it sure is pretty to look at on other peoples cars And there is also automatic temperature control Set the thermostat at say 72 degrees and it will stay there automatically Daddy where should I put this When you have little kids or are just a pack rat yourself you need lots of storage Brian has two little girls who are always in need of a tissue another pacifier a different CD a cracker or something else Well where do you put all those things that a child might need How about in your ample storage There is a window door split so that you can open only the glass or can open both glass and door together Someone has been driving my truck Brian is exceptionally tall so when I got in the truck to drive it I of course needed to adjust EVERYTHING ranging from the seat to the pedals there are adjusting pedals for different height people But when Brian gets back in the truck there is a memory feature that resets the seat mirrors and pedals to his original setting NICE Daddy im bored When my friend Brian called me and told me he had bought a new car to replace his 1995 Ford Explorer I thought he bought a more sensible car maybe a sedan or something Nope I was completely wrong Brain bought a 2001 Ford Expedition with Eddie Bauer trim Boy that is quite a truck The Expedition is so large that it resembles a small school bus However it doesnt drive like a school bus not not_that not_I not_have not_ever not_driven not_a not_school not_bus not_and not_certainly not_doesnt not_look not_like not_one not_when not_you not_consider not_all not_that not_the not_Expedition not_offers not_i not_So not_What not_Does not_it not_Offer not_I

a Godsend And for the adults entertainment there is a 6 CD changer standard with the truck Analog Gages voltage oil water temperature speed odometer fuel Warning Lights door ajar 4 wheel drive seat

Pos,If you dont not_tow not_you probably dont not_need not_the not_5 not_4l not_engine But even if you dont not_tow not_the not_Expy offers size safety and security for your family We couldnt have picked a better truck With the 5 4 liter V8 3 92 limited slip rear end and heavy duty tow package we can pull 7300 lbs I didnt not_buy not_my not_Expedition not_so not_I not_could not_run not_errands not_in not_town not_or not_drive not_my not_kids not_to not_practice not_I not_bought not_it not_to not_tow not_our not_5000 not_lb not_travel not_trailer not_and not_all not_of not_our not_camping not_gear The step up is very high but once inside you re greeted by a panoramic view around you A great feature is the power adjustable pedals which have a range of 4 inches Believe me they really make a difference There is a 14 inch height differential between my wife and I but we can both find a comfortable driving position More importantly my wife can remain a safe distance from the steering wheel air bag Reliability has been stellar Based on the time tested F 150 chassis the Expedition has proven itself both durable and reliable Our experience has borne this out After 6 months 15 000 miles and several towing trips my Expedition has required only one unscheduled service call to repair a slow leak in one tire yes Firestone Wilderness all four of which will be replaced by Ford in the next several weeks Gas mileage is a big drawback I have averaged about 14 8 miles per gallon in mixed driving 10 when towing the trailer But again I didnt not_buy not_it not_to not_replace not_my not_minivan
Pos,The sporty appearance is unmatched The optional 5 4L V8 has tremendous power The interior w comfort convenience group rivals that of a limo The stereo system performs well with a 6 disc changer as optional When inside the vehicle the interior lighting and optional leather interior create an atmosphere of comfort and luxury The third seat area is a bit hard to access and not not_made not_for not_very not_tall not_people but is adequate Removing the seat is a snap for extra storage space It will also tip up for extra space in the cargo area I have owned a Mustang and in my opinion the handling of the Expedition considering its size is comparable The acceleration is scary for such a large vehicle Both from a dead stop and while passing the performance is awe inspiring Road noise is minimal Shopping around and using dealer against dealer will save you 3 5 K off of MSRP Overall a great vehicle 9 out of 10 in my opinion
Pos,The tank holds about 20 gallons of gasoline The gas cap is easy to get on and off The Crown Vic gets pretty good gas mileage about 25 mpg on average The only drawback of this car is that it is rear wheel drive The drive is really smooth and the car handles like a much smaller car However we can put an adult there for short trips and it works okay The airbags make it unsafe to put a child there but that is really the size of the space He is no car expert either so we had to drive and redrive and sit in every car that seated 5 6 passengers comfortably We did this 23 302 times while we were deciding what was the best car for us The Crown Vic was our choice hands down The trunk is huge and has a safety release strap in the event that you should somehow become trapped in there Great for those with adventurous youngsters We feel that this issue was effectively dealt with the addition of traction control which my husband swears by We are thrilled by our purchase and it is a dream to drive this car We recently traded in our Ford Contour and purchased the much bigger Crown Victoria Try getting a family of six in a Contour No can do So out we went to buy a larger sedan for my hubby to drive There is ample power on acceleration and people get out of your way because they think you are a cop I especially like the way this car brakes I dont not_know not_any not_technical not_terms but it is very responsive It is plenty roomy in the backseat My teenagers and kindergartener have plenty of leg room and space for all the stuff they must carry no matter where they go The front bench seat will sit 3 but the middle person is a bit cramped We got a great deal on the car and Ford gave us extra incentive 0 financing for 60 months Cant beat it I hope this review helps those that are not not_car not_experts but want to find a really terrific car The Crown Vic will not not_disappoint Well this is not not_the not_type not_of not_review not_that not_I not_generally not_write not_I not_am not_a not_mom not_to not_4 not_girls not_and not_am not_busy not_doing not_things not_related not_to not_raising not_them not_I not_dont not_know not_much not_about not_the not_technical not_workings not_of not_cars but I drive them A LOT I really felt compelled to write an epinion about this car
Pos,The rear bench removes very easily with two people The engine was designed with easy access to wide mouthed filling spouts in mind We are pleased with our vehicle after three months and with the purchase process We purchased using the Internet Autobytel com to locate a dealer and set a price Our van has the 5 4 liter V 8 engine and it delivers very good power and acceleration The gas mileage comes in at 14 16 mpg on the highway and a consistent 11 12 mpg around town The visibility while driving is excellent with the height of the driver from the ground and the large sidemounted mirrors Due to the vehicle length lane changes require slightly more planning than a conventional minivan however the large mirrors provide excellent situational awareness Both the turning radius and turning response are very good and were much better than anticipated Parking requires patience but is not not_a not_difficult not_task not_including not_parallel not_parking The great height of the bottom of the vehicle from the ground make it completely unnecessary to jack the vehicle for oil plug or filter removal We found the height of the vehicle made running boards necessary in order to facilitate the handling of children and groceries around the vehicle We have found our E 350 to be a superior value to any minivan out there Fuel mileage and luxury features are the only advantage we have seen of a minivan over our conversion van One person who is capable of lifting 60 pounds can remove the bench as well With the rear bench removed there are twelve seats and a tremendous amount of cargo room although thought must be put into to securing cargo in the rear to prevent shifting Do it yourself oil changes and fluid refilling are a cinch with this van My wife and I purchased a 1999 Ford E 350 15 seater for our growing family with our sixth child on the way Our van is not not_loaded not_with not_options not_while not_we not_have not_tint not_windows not_cruise not_control not_and not_running not_boards not_we not_opted not_for not_no not_carpet not_or not_power not_features not_to not_assist not_us not_in not_keeping not_the not_van not_clean not_with not_active not_children not_and not_to not_minimize not_worries not_about not_equipment not_breakages not_down not_the not_years
Pos,We have had little trouble with these vans My husband have also hauled many things with these vans The biggest problem we have had is a Transmission leak He now works for a plumbing company and hauls pipe everywhere My family and I own two Aerostars and we just love them We have three kids and need the extra room if we are going on a trip or to the grocery store He used to work as a service tech for a window company and had to haul 3 hundred pound windows around for some of the services The vans are still running and one has over 150 000 miles on it and the other one has over 200 00 miles on it These have been some of the best cars that we have owned and we got them both used I could only hope that all the rest of the cars that we own are this good
Pos,The cd cassette radio sounds great and is easy to use and program There is not not_enough not_space not_to not_sit not_sideways not_in not_the not_seat not_and not_slide not_around not_to not_the not_front The 2000 Ford Econoline E350 12 passenger van we purchased in November is a perfect fit for our growing family The only thing I have to complain about is the space between the front bucket seats and the engine hub This van is a must have for growing families Even if your family hasnt outnumbered the seats in a minivan the kids will eventually be too uncomfortable in the cramped space The spaciousness of the van allows me to move pretty easily from front to back to help buckle and unbuckle my youngest kids from their car seats and there is plenty of space to put grocery bags during our monthly shopping trip We ordered this van in August before the birth of our 6th baby and while we had to wait a few weeks longer than anticipated it was well worth the wait After driving a minivan for 6 years the size of this van was a bit overwhelming at first But I love the height when driving around town and on the interstate Scraping ice and snow from the front windshield is tricky because of the height Getting in and out of the van is good exercise for me since we have not not_gotten not_running not_boards yet The van handles wonderfully even in snow Parking the van is a learned skill since some parking lots are designed with smaller parking spots
Pos,This truck was the big foot of all Custom style with all the extra If you go and look for a truck of this kind ask the dealership for information about California Concept and then you will have a truck you will love This make more safe when traveling and packing all your extra in the rear California Concept is a company that specializing in detailing with all the extra as tires and shields and medal steps side for that sporty look If I would of walked away and went on looking elsewhere it would of been gone People come up to me and ask where did you get your truck Its one of a kind custom made Rear Cab is custom with closure of the body color and lock Not with cab liner as most truck I have been looking for many years for a truck that will stand out from all others I have found it Ford has made many models and sold millions I went to the Ford Dealership where I live and I was shopping for a truck and as I walked into the show room there it was This truck was made to stay in the showroom and their was not not_one not_other not_was not_like not_this not_one not_I not_then not_looked not_it not_over and it had all I wanted and I was sold I test driven and I was surprised that this truck was made for me I seen trucks of the same model on the lot and this one was made special Large tires with mags California Concept detailing I said to the sale man I ll take it There was group of people there wanting to take this truck out of the showroom and was told its sold
Pos,There is plenty of room in the front seat We purchased a 1999 Ford F 150 in May of 1999 We bought the base model and added only the 60 40 seat cruise control and a cassette player It is very forgiving however the clutch is stiff and could be difficult for someone with knee problems The truck handles the road very well in rain and snow and I have only a couple of times wished for 4 wheel drive It is important to get measurements of the car seats though because some brands of car seats will not not_fit not_behind not_either not_seat We have traveled from NJ to La and from NJ to IL several times in the truck and it rides extremely well The 4th door makes putting a child into and removing a child from a car seat extremely easy and a car seat fits perfectly behind either seat or in the middle of the rear seat The rear seat on the other hand is not not_made not_for not_an not_adult not_to not_ride not_long not_distances not_in not_We not_have not_put not_our not_two not_kids not_in not_the not_rear not_seat not_and not_they not_seem not_happy In fact I have never run into a case where I needed a larger engine but I am certain that towing a large trailor or heavy loads would tax the V 6 The manual transmission is great and it shifts like a car We bought the truck to serve as a reliable vehicle for me to commute to work in and for us to take long trips in We kept the standard V 6 engine which works fine if you are towing a small trailor and reasonable loads The bed of the truck is full sized so there is no problem hauling plywood unlike the new 4 door F 150s I strongly recommend adding a topper about 800 1200 since it greatly increases the utility and security of the goods you are hauling as well as nearly eliminating the disposing of garbage in the truck bed It is a difficult vehicle to enter so if you are going to have someone whose mobility is less than normal riding in the truck check to see how easy it is for them to enter and leave the cab Whenever I drive my mother I must give her a boost to get in and a hand out Riding boards help but do not not_eliminate not_this not_problem not_4 not_wheel not_drive not_makes not_this not_even not_worse not_Fuel not_economy not_is not_reasonable not_I not_generally not_get not_19 not_20 not_mpg not_normal not_use not_and not_about not_21 not_22 not_on not_the not_highway not_Overall not_it not_is not_a not_great not_truck not_for not_the not_price not_and not_a not_great not_vehicle not_to not_see not_the not_country not_in
Pos,The 4 doors make entering and exiting the vehicle quite easy for my 7 year old son The front seat offers a flip down console that locks in place for added storage The 4 wheel drive is a must for those who have to drive in inclement weather The F 150 Ford Series offers many people what they will be looking for in a full size truck If your looking for a truck that offers a smooth ride than look no further than the F 150 The rear seat is good for smaller children but adults dont not_think not_there not_is not_enough not_leg not_room not_Especially not_if not_the not_front not_passengers not_have not_there not_seats not_all not_the not_way not_back No need to get out and lock in the hubs either the F150 changes from 2 wheel to 4 wheel drive with the quick and easy shift of a lever The 5 4L Triton v 8 offers all the power you will need Whether you want to tow the boat up to the lake or have to drive up a snow covered hill the F 150 should be your vehicle of choice The front 60 40 seat offers comfort with driver side lumbar control Lots of leg room and head room for those that dont not_like not_to not_feel not_boxed not_in not_All not_of not_the not_climate not_controls not_and not_radio are well within reach to improve road safety
Pos,Make the console longer The seats are very comfortable but solid Hello I love my Ford F 150 supercab Also the fold down console is not not_very not_convenient not_for not_your not_arms If anyone wants a wonderful truck get yourself a Ford F 150 supercab You will wonder why you did not not_do not_it not_before not_now The fog lights is what got me home I wouldnt not_have not_a not_truck not_without not_them There were nights it was snowing so bad I could not not_see not_the not_road not_in not_front not_of not_me It is so convenient to be able to go and open the doors from either side Packing and unpacking is so much better The fourth door in the 99s was a wonderful idea I have had three F 150s and by far this on is my favorite This makes for a long drive a very pleasant and comfortable drive Remember drive a Ford F 150 and you will see what I am talking about The fog lights are wonderful I have been able to get home at night many times with your fog lights I lived fifty miles out of town in the mountains The only thing I can think of is the noise reduction needs to be worked on There is alot of noise driving down the highway I have had it checked out at the dealership and they have told me that is the truck Nothing is wrong as far as the truck goes Please make it a more quite ride for people that enjoy cruiseing down the highway listening to there music
Pos,It came with the standard installed sound system that has been superior The rear opening doors have been a plus easy in and out and with good latches and seals The F 150 that I have has been the best truck that I have owned the comfort level of the seats and the interior is great The manual locking hubs are still the way to go I bought this truck because Fords are the only trucks I have ever owned this one makes number 10 The model I have has a 300 cubic inch 6 that has plenty of power to handle the 4X4 operations the automatic locking hubs leave a little to be desired other then that the truck handles and operates with ease The hub locking is not not_what not_I not_expected not_the not_thing not_I not_dont not_like not_is not_you not_must not_travel not_forward not_about not_10 not_feet not_before not_they not_lock not_in not_so not_if not_you not_dont not_lock not_them not_in not_before not_you not_start not_you not_could not_be not_in not_trouble not_and not_if not_you not_have not_to not_back not_up not_for not_any not_reason not_they not_will not_unlock not_and not_the not_whole not_thing not_starts not_over not_again not_Not not_one not_of not_Fords not_better not_Ideas
Pos,The cost was 24 000 00 was like a steal This truck has lots of room for a truck it fits 5 adults comfortably This is a Vehicle to Love I bought a 2000 Ford F 150 its terrific it has 4 doors all the luxurys of a car rides wonderful it has a cd player power windows abs brakes on all 4 wheels While theres no four wheel drive on this vehicle they do make them I didnt not_want not_4 not_wheel not_drive nor did i want a V 8 this truck is a V 6 and still moves great I had a Dodge Ram before this and it rode just like a truck on the freeways it made me sick to ride in it so if you want a truck with all the luxurys of a car and the ride of a car this is the truck for you They are priced well and look great and run terrific
Pos,The selling points for me was the look the drive and the power This truck rides smooth and doesnt do bad on gas as well As for the power it was unmatched All I have to say is if your looking for a Truck the F150 would be a good choice The F150 that I am telling you about is a 2000 F 150 4x4 Supercab Lariat 139 WB flareside with a 5 4 EFI V8 engine When I was out comparing trucks I was looking for one that had the power to pass at any given time and the comfort of a car I compared price and that seemed about the same Their are many different styles to choose from as well Some other selling points would be the compartment between the seats has plenty of room for anything you might want to put in there Although this truck is sleek it probably would be a little difficult for some people to get in and out of it
Pos,This is my second ford truck The electronic odometer has a trip computer So far the drawbacks are pretty standard My initial mileage first 1000 miles was around 14 Hwy 12City My wife also really likes the truck now We have to fight for the keys This truck has done pretty well during the break in period This outlet in the back is perfect for cell phones and laptops The rear seats fold down to provide dry storage inside of the cab The other issue is that the brakes while adequate feel a little mushy The truck came with floor mats and treated upholstery something similar to scotch guard In fact I would say that this is close to my dream truck The gauges on the truck show speed tachometer oil pressure system charge coolant temperature At highway speeds the truck has very little wind noise in the cabin compared to my 97 truck My wife and I looked at the Taurus Wagon the Volvo Wagons Ford Explorer Subaru Wagon and a few minivans No mistaking it doesnt equal a cars ride but it rides like a very smooth truck The middle seat in the front folds down to be a storage compartment and has two cup holders In the front you can also ride three adults comfortably so it really is 6 passenger seating This car is perfect for our 4 member family and is a great utility for us as homeowners The factory radio is decent but is easily drowned out when you have the windows down The gas mileage is an issue but is to be expected with a large truck that is V 8 powered It is a silver 2003 F 150 Supercrew XLT 4x4 4 6 V 8 with the Class III towing package option and ABS all around In the middle of the drive I called my wife and we stopped by to get her and my two boys When the demands of family life outweigh the number of seats in your regular cab pickup what can you do TRADE UP My wife was really amazed at the space in the cab with the bonus of having a truck bed Let me describe my truck In addition Ford fixed the issue that I had with my 1997 F 150 by moving the exhaust pipe to exit behind the rear wheel This truck has large mirrors and the hood drops away so that the driver can see what is immediately in front of the truck So during the test drive we had two large male adults me and the salesman both 250 lbs my wife and two car seats with the boys riding comfortably The over head console has a compass and outside temperature but no other information I would like to see maybe distance to empty gas mileage etc It also includes cruise control AC 17 inch wheels w OWL tires 3 73 rear axle an in dash single CD player power windows power locks power mirrors fog lights and a Ford bed liner Also when the truck has a few hundred pounds in the bed and 4 5 people in the cab it rides like a luxury car My wife was leaning toward the Volvo and I of course wanted more truck After shopping around I went on a test drive with the salesman It is a split bench in the rear so I can still fold down 1 3 of the seat and have the two car seats in the back Some of the other things I have noticed about the truck are that the driver has excellent visibility of the road around him her My wife likes the under seat storage in the rear also Behind the rear seats are storage compartments and one of them holds the jack and tire iron for the truck The 4 6 V 8 also only rates in my opinion as adequate I have learned not not_to not_drive not_a not_truck not_like not_a not_car not_so not_this not_isnt not_a not_big not_issue not_to not_me Before we started our search I thought we would have to forsake the utility of a truck However the Super Crew and other four door trucks covers a lot of bases There are also two cup holders in the rear I also have two outlets in the front radar detector and cell phone and an outlet in the rear located in the seatbelt anchor The 4 6 V 8 was adequate task but could really use more power when towing something that large like the 5 4L v 8 With the overdrive disabled the truck would really lug going up hills with the added weight When the bed is empty and you are by yourself prepare to bounce over every bump price you pay for HD suspension and having a truck All in all I am very satisfied with my purchase at this point She feels very comfortable driving it good visibility she likes the functional privacy glass in the rear to keep sun off the kids the child locks in the rear are a plus and so far her only issue is getting used to climbing up into the truck The tires that came with the truck are Goodyear Wranglers I dont not_have not_any not_complaints not_so not_far not_on not_the not_tires but I like the Dunlop Rover LTs which are excellent in the rain I will let you know how the Wranglers do 2500 Mile Update Our main goal was to get a roomy car for long trips and to have a second car that could hold two child car seats and two more adults A secondary issue was replacing my truck which is a 1997 F 150 regular cab I also wrote review on that truck One minor issue is the adjustable pedals gas brake there is a switch on the dash for moving them and it is NOT deactivated while the truck is in motion I sometimes nudge the buttons with my knee Towing I towed a 88 Ford Crown Victoria to the auction on an auto transport trailer 30 miles Other than that the engine is more than adequate for family hauling and highway cruising I was able to 4x4 with a full load of wood with no problem in wet muddy terrain With regards to gas mileage I monitor with trip computer and gas receipts I am getting 17 mpg on highway and 14 in the city For all those with kids there are tether anchors in the rear During the first week I had the truck I put approx 1000 miles on it doing my work commute and routine errand running My initial impression is that Ford really softened the ride so that you dont not_get not_that not_jarring not_truck not_feel not_when not_going not_over not_bumps If we can put a man on the moon we can make a light duty 4x4 V 8 funtional truck that gets 18 MPG city and 22 MPG HWY Family Duty is where the truck really shines Trips to Sams Club with the family are a breeze with plenty of room for bulk paper towels bulk food and other gargantuan grocery list items
Pos,To fill up THE BEAST It costs 40 00 at least This is definitely a macho truck and well worth every penny The search is on anyone wanna buy a slightly used BEAST All in all this has been an excellent truck very dependable and spacious You must be thin as you try and squeeze yourself out between the cars And lets not not_forget not_about not_parking not_Gripe not_6 not_Parking not_spaces are meant for cars not not_trucks So soon I may have to part with THE BEAST parting will be such sweet sorrow My husband even has a hard time with the seat removal so a lot of the time we just keep it flat This is our nickname for our Ford Expedition why you say Because it is such a huge beast of a truck So what do I like about THE BEAST you say Three words FOUR WHEEL DRIVE LOVE IT We just needed more room for our family and this is the perfect vehicle if thats what you are looking for too But rest assured my next one will also be black four wheel drive and a sun roof too it just will have a girlier nick name like BEAUTY hmmm It is ALWAYS a tight squeeze to get into those spaces at the malls and once you get in to the spot getting out of your car is a whole new issue We first purchased the Eddie Bauer version of the Ford Explorer last summer because I was rapidly outgrowing my Ford Explorer With two kids car seats baby strollers and expensive makeup cases to haul around we decided it was time to expand It has never let me down and thats worth its weight in gold I also feel very safe in this vehicle and absolutely hate riding in cars now THE BEAST sits high and proud and its V8 engine can really take off So part of the proceeds of this review will get me a gallon of gas If you live or work in a building with a parking garage better check the height allowances Gripe 5 because this bad boy needs clearance of 6 6 ive scraped many a garage roof We had always wanted an Expedition and searched high and low until we found the exact one we were looking for a black one with a sun roof Its like a taste of freedom to open that roof and the closest thing I ll get to a convertible My oldest son is six and he had so much fun riding in the third seat but I found it to be unsafe back there I am a big believer in booster seats for kids and that is not not_the not_place not_for not_him not_And not_once not_all not_three not_seats not_are not_up not_there not_is not_almost not_no not_room not_for not_storage not_at not_all not_Gripe not_2 So now that you know how much I weigh let me tell you how tall I am now 5 5 Why you say Well this is my problem with this vehicle Gripe 3 I am just too small to see behind me especially when I am backing up It has a third seat in the back of the truck that can also fold down flat or you can remove it altogether Gripe 1 However you must be very strong to both remove and or fold the seat down I have found it impossible to do this as a woman weighing 112 pounds The front seats are high bucket seats which I think are an obstacle I am thoroughly convinced this is a MANs truck and not not_made not_for not_women not_even not_though not_I not_see not_more not_moms not_driving not_them not_I not_even not_tried not_sitting not_on not_an not_elevated not_foam not_pad but that made it even more difficult Since purchasing this vehicle the price of gasoline has gone up daily Gripe 4 Can you say GAS GUZZLER But im thinking about trading it in for a slightly smaller truck I have become convinced that it is not not_the not_most not_comfortable not_car not_to not_drive and it is just too big for me I take a lot of flack from men that I work with about driving such a monster truck Most of them are very envious of THE BEAST everyone has something to say about it Its kind of like BEAST envy
Pos,The interior of the Expedition has met all my expectations The radio and CD player have been fine with good sound and easy to manipulate knobs and buttons What happened to the engine I do not not_know Did Ford handle the problem correctly I dont not_know The handle in the back seat that hangs from the ceiling has gotten loose and the clothes hook has come off on one side Otherwise I have had no interior problems at all I know that the car runs well however my prized possession the great air conditioning is not not_the not_same While driving home from visiting relatives several months ago I blew up the engine in my Expedition I had just had the oil changed that morning I crept into the nearest Ford dealership in Mineral Wells Texas and was given the bad news Ford paid for all but 1000 of the new engine and most of my rental car for the next 3 weeks There is ample leg room in the second seat for adults as well as children Behind the back seat is enough space for groceries without moving the third seat at all With the third seat folded down I have been able to tote anything I have need to even with 5 kids and a dog Golf clubs trips to Sams camping trips etc have all been accomplished without me ever having to take out the seat It takes almost an hour to get the ice cold air I used to have immediatly I have plenty of freon and no one knows the problem I will be getting a new car in the next 6 months or so and I probably will not not_be not_buying not_another not_Ford not_Not not_because not_of not_anything not_except not_I not_guess not_at not_36 not_years not_old not_I not_should not_drive not_something not_else not_so not_I not_can not_have not_a not_reference not_to not_compare not_it not_with ive driven Fords since I got my Mustang when I was 16 From there I bought a Cougar then an Explorer I now drive an Eddie Bauer Expedition I guess the one common denominator with all my Fords is the awesome air conditioner Living in Texas with our summers air conditioning is very important and I believe they get a good testing here when the temperature reaches over 100 for days in a row To make matters more interesting my current Expedition is black
Pos,The Ford Expedition is a wonderful SUV It cleans easily with a little leather cleaner The Expedition has been a trouble free automobile for the past 30 000 miles It does however have an electronic distance to empty and compass gauge The 5 4 is also a very capable engine option in the mountains of Colorado The seat is however easy to remove with two people at each side The truck has only needed routine maintenance such as oil changes and windshield wiper fluid The leather on the seats has held up well to wet swimsuits and dirty jeans The 5 4 goes through the gas rather quickly getting about 300 350 miles from a full tank However if you do not not_need not_it not_the not_seat not_is not_more not_of not_a not_hassle The truck moves well with the automobiles of lesser weight and ascends quickly up the steep inclines Though 20 of a vehicles power is lost in the mountains the Expedition had power to spare If you are hauling many people i e 8 then the rear seat is worth the 300 option price The Expedition that I have the pleasure of owning is a 1998 Eddie Bauer edition with a 5 4 liter engine It has been to the dealership only to look at new Expeditions that I will definitely purchase when the lease expires The vehicle is equipped with part time four wheel drive which allows it to be driven on dry roads with four wheel engaged The oil is extremely easy to change for the do it yourselfer because the oil pick up and filter are separate from the engine block When you wish to haul large objects in the back the seat leaves you with only one to two feet of cargo space when installed The lease that Ford offered has been trouble free and was explained well when I purchased the vehicle from Woodhouse Ford in Blair Nebraska The Expedition does exceptionally well in the snow I have four wheeled in about 8 inches of snow and could not not_get not_the not_vehicle not_stuck not_in not_drifts or otherwise The truck senses wheel spin and puts it in four wheel drive only when needed Full time and four low can also be selected with the flip of a switch which lock the four wheels in drive mode The truck provides a commanding view of the road and is obstructed only by semi trucks and other trucks of that nature Plan on spending about 30 to fill the tank from empty at 1 20 per gallon gas prices The only bad thing that I can comment on the vehicle is that it was not not_equipped not_with not_an not_outside not_temperature not_gauge not_which not_is not_nice not_if not_the not_roads not_get not_slick not_and not_you not_want not_to not_see not_if not_it not_is not_freezing Also if you plan to buy a lot of groceries with the seat installed plan on putting them in the back seat or picking up your canned goods that fall all over when placed on top of the folded seat back The engine is more than capable of pulling the Expeditions weight plus another four or five thousand pounds of trailer I have used the vehicle to pull a 22 foot sport boat to Arkansas and the truck did well in the hills of the Ozark Mountains Stopping power with a trailer is also very good though added distance is needed of course The filter is located right up front and is vertically placed so no oil drips out when unscrewing the filter Spark plugs on the overhead cam 5 4 engine last until 100 000 miles so I am not not_able not_to not_comment not_on not_changing not_those not_however not_they not_look not_difficult not_to not_reach not_because not_the not_engine not_is not_recessed not_in not_its not_bay
Pos,Now for our negative experiences The middle back is very roomy and comfortable Our timing could have been better in buying this vehicle Hes wanted one since they came out in 1997 When I have a full vehicle while making the preschool run I feel like a bus First the third seat didnt not_come not_out not_as not_easily not_as not_we not_were not_told not_or not_as not_the not_owners not_manual not_indicated When we were faced with buying a bigger vehicle suitable for transporting more people my husband wouldnt not_consider not_anything not_other not_than not_an not_Expedition The temperature controls and radio controls for the back are nice A neutral point small children or shorter adults are the only ones comfortable in the third seat Thats what the kids call it and the teacher commented that it was a pretty nice bus ive never ridden on a school bus as nice The back hatch if you will is kind of hard and heavy to put down Observation the further back you sit the bouncier it gets We found it bought it on a Saturday and the interest rates went up the previous Monday Need I mention the price of gas Okay both of these are nobodys fault I ll start with the positive My husband ended up having to use some tools to undo something I dont not_know not_I not_wasnt not_here not_when not_he not_did not_it not_I not_wish not_there not_was not_more not_room not_behind not_the not_third not_seat not_and not_the not_door So this vehicle has made two trips to the shop before we made our first payment im not not_sure not_how not_to not_answer not_the not_reliability not_question not_since not_we not_havent not_owned not_it not_all not_that not_long not_and not_the not_two not_trips not_to not_the not_shop not_havent not_really not_been not_engine not_related Ford put a gas cap warning light on your dash or something instead of having to go through all of this I let my husband get gas once in the fourteen years we ve been married and he cant not_even not_do not_that not_right not_ive not_taken not_his not_keys not_away His wish finally came true In late February 2000 we bought a 98 Eddie Bauer im trying to I really want to like it but im going to tell you about our experiences in the 2 shorts months we ve had it I hope this isnt not_an not_indication not_of not_whats not_to not_come The main thing I like is it gives you a commanding view of the road sitting up so high I LOVE the fact that the doors automatically lock when put in gear Since I have small children I appreciate the child proof lock option I do not not_think not_its not_hard not_to not_maneuver but I am used to big cars The only way they can figure this out is by hooking it up to their computer wherein they get the error code Even if we knew the gas cap wasnt not_on not_properly not_upon not_seeing not_the not_check not_engine not_light not_the not_mechanic not_told not_me not_that not_it not_would not_not not_automatically not_go not_off not_once not_it not_had not_been not_tripped not_it not_had not_to not_be not_reset not_by not_a not_mechanic not_Okay not_so not_why not_doesnt We hadnt had this vehicle for 2 weeks when I put the back window right back door down and it wouldnt not_go not_back not_up not_We not_live not_3 not_hours not_from not_the not_dealership not_where not_we not_bought not_it not_We not_got not_it not_fixed not_locally not_and not_they not_reimbursed not_us not_Two not_weeks not_later not_on not_a not_Monday not_im not_on not_my not_way not_home not_from not_taking not_kids not_to not_preschool not_when not_the not_check not_engine not_light not_came not_on not_I not_couldnt not_get not_it not_in not_to not_the not_local not_shop not_until not_Wednesday not_60 not_later not_we not_found not_out not_that not_my not_husband not_didnt not_put not_the not_gas not_cap not_on not_properly not_after not_getting not_gas not_Since not_the not_gas not_cap not_wasnt not_on not_correctly not_it not_was not_emitting not_illegal not_emissions not_thus not_triggering not_the not_check not_engine not_light
Pos,We just take out the third seat and pile up the back with our stuff I highly recommend this one We traded in our Ford Explorer on an 1998 Eddie Bauer Expedition and it was the best choice we have made by far This SUV turns on a dime which is great compared to the Crew Cab Ford Pickup we used to own Much easier to handle in those parking lots at the mall amp grocery store In addition I didnt not_know not_that not_there not_was not_airbag not_suspension not_we not_bought not_the not_Expedition not_but not_there not_is not_and not_it not_makes not_it not_a not_much not_more not_comfortable not_ride not_compared not_to not_that not_jolty not_Explorer not_I not_would not_recommend not_this not_vehicle not_to not_a not_family not_of not_three not_to not_seven not_and not_the not_smaller not_the not_family not_the not_better not_for not_a not_roadtrip The cabin is roomy the seats comfortable and easy to clean when the little ones get them dirty and feels like you re riding on air I do wish we had a more current model since now the foot pedals on the 2000 models adjust to peoples height as I am 5 4 I would like that little perk
Pos,We re back to smooth sailing again It looked like more than just a truck It rides just like a car and handles really well We ll never take a road trip in a little car again The dealer was really great about getting it fixed right away The only problem we ve had with the vehicle was an oil leak You ride up high you re in control of the road Its great family fun We also took it on a west coast vacation trip from Southern California to Northern California We got the leather interiors chrome accents and running boards and it sure looks great The kids love it because we can take all their friends along and they also have kid room The Ford Explorer was the most popular at the time but the Expedition caught our eye because of its size and luxury look He just pops out the third row seat and his equipment fits nicely in the back I love how it rides and turns The far back seat is fun for them cause it has a little bounce to it My husband has found the vehicle useful for his new Disc Jockey business I really love the Ford Expedition ive had it a year now and it still drives like it did when I first bought it I used to own an Acura Integra but after having two children we needed a more spacious vehicle
Pos,We also purchased the extended 6 yr 100 000 mile warranty The car is a very smooth and stable vehicle on the road The only down side is that it wont fit in all parking garages It will cruise 80 miles per hour all day with no effort The original tires are still doing well having rotated them every other oil change We ordered a 4x2 w leather 6 pack CD 4 6L engine and without rear seat or towing pkg If you are in a wreck you will probably be safer than in a smaller car After owning 3 Ford Explorers we decided to order a new 98 Expedition in the Fall of 97 Other than that we have changed the engine oil every 4 000 miles and the transmission at 36 000 miles When you get out of the comfortable leather bucket seats after a 10 hour run you are not not_totaled not_as not_you not_are not_in not_some not_cars We really enjoy it Another plus is the visibility my wife enjoys the safety afforded by this and the size of the unit We have traveled extensively in this car since then Putting over 50 000 miles on it Total repairs have been to replace the front brakes at 36 000 and the rears at 50 000 miles We have found a couple where the roof rack will hit I have found it an easy matter to remove the roof rack if I am going to be exposed to this situation They look like they have at least another 15 000 safe miles NO other problems Fuel mileage on trips averages 21 MPG around town about 15 or so im satisfied in every way with this car and would recommend one to just about anyone that wants this type of automobile
Pos,There isnt not_a not_driving not_situation not_that not_this not_vehicle not_will not_not not_overcome My wife particularly loves the vehicle because she feels secure behind the wheel This vehicle is for everybody especially for a large family lots of room Love it My wife was very confident that this vehicle would get her home safely and that is what it did The power went out in the store and the customers were told that the store was closing Outside there was a number of trees and power lines down It is a very safe vehicle and extremely reliable in any type of weather During the Labor Day storm we had in the northeast my wife was out shopping and got caught in the store during the storm I just cannot not_say not_enough not_about not_the not_Ford not_Expedition not_I not_have not_owned not_one not_for not_the not_past not_two not_years not_and not_have not_been not_extremely not_happy not_with not_this not_vehicle not_I not_have not_taken not_the not_family not_to not_Myrtle not_beach not_on not_two not_separate not_occasion not_in not_this not_vehicle not_and not_the not_drive not_was not_pleasurable
Pos,Dear Prosepctive Car Buyer This is just a monster We can pull boats trailers mobile homes Thanks for reading my article write up Now we have the Ford Expedition and we just live in it We have a Huge Triton V8 5 4 litre We just got our Ford Expedition 1 year ago and we just love it At first we had the next best thing a Ford Explorer and that was the tops You name it and the Ford Expedition can take it on With just the right amount of space inside this Ford Expedition does not not_even not_compare not_to not_the not_GMC not_Sonoma not_or not_the not_GMC not_Suburban Other cars we had considered when purchasing the Expedition Ford has such an excellent reputation and it sure lives up with this Only in the shop for an oil change it really lives up to standard From torque to comfort and from luxury to power the Ford Expedition blows away all other competitors
Pos,There are some things No matter what other options you give up get the larger engine It was when I drove it though that my love turned into lust and I couldnt get enough I went to different dealerships every couple of weeks to test drive it more like get my fix As soon as I saw this SUV I fell in love and I knew no matter how long it would take me to save the money for this beast I had to have it For one its truly a luxury vehicle it has all the luxury options of a Lexus or BMW in a truck Id suggest getting on an Expedition 3rd seat its light and easy to remove and you ll be thankful if you ever need to take 7 other people somewhere Rear Air those 7 other people will be thankful if you have it I enjoy the 6 disc CD changer its great for the music lover and you commuters out there I think the Expedition looks a heck of a lot meaner with the 17 inch rims which in turn require the illuminated running boards and last but definitely not not_least do not not_I not_repeat not_do not_not not_let not_any not_salesperson not_talk not_you not_out not_of not_the not_5 not_4 not_liter not_engine not_Its not_like not_the not_difference not_between not_a not_Ford not_Escort not_and not_a not_Mustang
Pos,The Expedition provided just the right mix There would have been way to much therapy involved We would still have to take two vehicles if we wanted to go somewhere with our kids and other friends and family It seemed to me that the choices were a mini van or an SUV I just couldnt go from a Jeep to a mini van As we looked at the SUVs on the market I noticed that the Ford Explorer and others like it were nothing more than a large sedan with a really tall trunk For 10 years I owned a Jeep Wrangler and I loved everything about it Then I got married and we had twins a couple of years later Well the old Jeep wasnt not_gonna not_hold not_all not_the not_baby not_things not_that not_come not_along not_with not_the not_babies not_so not_we not_went not_looking not_for not_something not_else It holds all our kids stuff is easy to get in and out of handles extremely well this baby will turn on a dime and still allows us to take our kids and our folks out to dinner in the same vehicle I have taken it off road on many occasions and have only minor complaints about its abilities there Its easy enough for my little wife to drive and it fits into my garage A fairly amazing feat with the size of garages being built these days but thats for another review Bottom line is it is easy to drive holds lots of stuff and fits in the garage Sure the gas mileage really blows but its a small sacrifice for the comfort I get I highly recommend this vehicle to anyone who needs space comfort reliability and something more manly than a mini van
Pos,I purchased a used Ford Expedition in late 1999 when my job begin requiring me to go to remote radio tower repeater sites in the Ozarks The Expedition has the 5 4 engine with the trailer towing package and only gets about 13 14 MPG on the highway I will most definitely miss it but its running me nearly 40 week for gasoline The only problem I have had has been a small hole was worn in a T fitting on the engine resulting in a check engine light and rough idle About 45 dollars at the deal fixed it I will probably be getting rid of it soon as my job duties have changed once again and I no longer need the 4 WD and I am driving farther to work The Expedition was simply the most comfortable vehicle I have ever owned I felt very safe and secure with nearly 3 tons of metal around me the 4 wheel drive relieved me of hiking into remote sites carrying 75 or so pounds of radio test equipment I thoroughly researched available SUVs before I made the plunge and the Expedition was the only one which met all of the criteria for my uses
Pos,It is a very good investment to make ive been a proud owner of a 1966 Mustang convertible for five years You can get one in any mustang restoration catalog for about 200 In these accidents when the mustangs were rear ended the gas tanks were punctured causing gas to get all over the driver and burn them If you own an old car you should be responsible and make sure it is safe Classic mustangs are the best cars ever and they dont not_need not_a not_minor not_flaw not_like not_this not_messing not_up not_their not_reputation When compared with other old car problems this seems to be very small I suggest that if you do own a 60s mustang with this problem you buy a metal barrier so that gas cannot not_enter not_the not_car It is one of the best cars I have ever driven I recently watched a TV program where they investigated the exploding gas tanks in 1960s mustangs I think it is not not_as not_big of a deal as they make it out to be In this TV report they blamed Ford Motor Company for the deaths of several teen age mustang drivers The gas entered the car because of the fold down back seat I know that in my convertible there is no possible way for anything to get from the trunk to the back seat Only fastbacks have this fold down seat Ford shouldnt not_be not_blamed not_for not_any not_of not_this not_If not_you not_own not_a not_car not_from not_the not_1960s not_you not_should not_know not_that not_it not_isnt not_going not_to not_be not_that not_safe
Pos,There was a problem with the rivets on the frame but they fixed that for free too I got this truck new and it took all my money but it was worth it since its a keeper I thought it was a bust at first because it kept going into 4 wheel drive for no reason but I just called the Ford assistance line and they sent a tow truck out It turned out that the factory had left an extra spring shackle wedged in the front end somewhere which would rub on the front axle when you turned causing the automatic hubs to engage Anyway they fixed it for free The only thing they dont not_fix not_for not_free is the automatic hubs which went out once on me I figure they need fixing once every three years which is better than getting out to lock them manually I didnt not_like not_how not_low not_the not_truck not_sat not_so not_I not_got not_a not_4 not_lift not_big not_tires not_and not_this not_reverse not_shackle not_thing not_on not_the not_front not_which not_makes not_it not_ride not_better not_on not_the not_freeway not_where not_its not_all not_rippled not_Its not_an not_animal not_on not_the not_ranches not_goes not_up not_anything not_even not_when not_the not_roads not_are not_washed not_out not_Once not_I not_dropped not_the not_right not_rear not_in not_a not_ditch not_and not_the not_left not_front not_was not_in not_the not_air not_and not_I not_had not_to not_pull not_it not_out not_with not_the not_dozer not_but not_thats not_the not_only not_time not_it not_got not_stuck not_Its not_got not_this not_turbo not_charged not_power not_stroke not_diesel not_which not_will not_out not_accelerate not_the not_460 not_gas not_version not_here not_in not_California not_Some not_people not_dont not_like not_it not_making not_a not_lot not_of not_noise not_but not_I not_dont not_care not_I not_live not_in not_the not_country
Pos,The truck handled well on the rainy streets We also run errands with this truck This cupholder holds a 20 ounce soda perfectly We both looked in the classifieds and online It kept turning over but never started It works but the sound is annoying 11 02 There are also gauges on the dash including temperature oil charging and fuel They replaced the switch free of charge one month left on the warranty There are four speakers in the cab giving a luxurious sound and GREAT separation The water was not not_excessive not_but not_noticeable upon my nearly bare feet nonetheless 05 12 02 One can see the traffic up ahead as this vehicle sits higher than most other vehicles There is a dual cup holder which pops out of the dash just above the ashtray It can be difficult to reach items that you put in the box We bought this truck to go back and forth to work and for camping note my camping reviews The dome light turns on automatically along with a couple of auxiliary lights in the same compartment behind the drivers seat There are also pockets on each door which would be handy for maps coupon books etc The fuel pump is located by the fuel tank and one needs to take off the fuel tank to gain access If you should not not_shut not_your not_door not_properly not_a not_light comes on to tell you that your door is ajar If I park on the hill rather than the base of the hill I can occasionally hear the truck creeking backward The dash is deep about an arms length which I guess is neither here nor there but perhaps worth mentioning Things seem to have gone well with this truck and we just put on 2 000 miles on a one week trip There is plenty of room in back of the seat which is split 60 40 and carpeted on the back There is ample storage in back of the seat in case I wish to keep store purchases out of view There is a dual cigarette lighter perhaps one for lighting cigarettes and the other for power toys such as a TV cell phone charger or auxiliary defroster It can burn rubber easily when backing up a wet hill however I back into my driveway which is on a hill We have been doing business with Keith ever since he opened about 5 years ago There is also a compartment near the steering wheel for one to put small items in The glove box is wide but not not_very not_deep When I took it in for warranty work they noted that a bad oxygen sensor needed replacing which they did free of charge The hood may be made from aluminum or plastic as it will not not_hold not_a not_magnet not_Unsure not_of not_the not_gauge not_of not_tin not_used not_elsewhere not_on not_the not_body He also advised that the tires needed replacing All Pro specializes in brake and muffler repair service The vehicle itself is wider than I am normally used to driving I am unsure about fine points of parking this larger vehicle That is when the manual gearshifter knob came off in my hand I suppose it could have caused an accident Mileage 60 000 Replacement gear shift knob approximately 14 7 03 We have about 61 000 miles on the truck I was driving along perfectly well I stopped for a minute and attempted to restart the truck This vehicle has dual mirrors the passenger side one is slightly convex Negatives Some of the drawbacks the bed in this full sized 2 wheel drive pickup is TALL Other than brakes and mufflers Keiths customers have demanded that he go into virtually all kinds of mechanical repairs My husband has successfully parked half way up the hill when encouraging the sun to melt the snow in the winter time Occasionally the passenger seatbelt will make a ratcheting sound It is also used for pleasure and long distance trips 1 2 times a year 7 03 I was shifting gears quickly to change lanes in heavy traffic It may take a key as I see a key slot as well as a button I will need to investigate this however we have no small children in our household He is a straightforward person and will tell you the way it is being nice in the process However the truck was a 3 owner high mileage truck with a strong 460 V 8 my husband adds We asked the salesperson at Jims Dodge Country to see if he could get us a good deal on tires He called a nearby company T O Hass Tires located at 5120 L St who made us a good deal Also I noted that when I drove home during a 3 hour trip on a very humid day there was a bit of condensation coming off the air conditioning unit placed above my sandal clad feet It will be difficult to scrape ice off the windshield in the middle of winter Also I tend to hold the steering wheel by the horizontal bar that the horn is on while driving We went in there to have our brakes replaced on our Chevette only to have him tell us that all they needed was a free adjustment For some odd reason my husband wanted to buy another Ford Hopefully we will have better luck with this one As well the hazard lights do not not_always not_work not_properly and sometimes only one out of four lights blink 7 29 01 I took the Ford in earlier this week because the overhead light did not not_come not_on not_consistently not_when not_I not_opened not_the not_drivers not_door We also went to H P Smith Ford located at 5051 L St who very agreeably set up service for the items still under warranty If things change you will be the second folks to know FYI We used to have a Ford F250 1981 which was a Fix Or Repair Daily When I did coax it to start it ran VERY rough and I was scared to drive it Seems the FUEL PUMP went out Bill 360 We had a range of 290 from a private garage to over 400 at the dealer The salesperson was originally asking 12 600 but we were able to negotiate down to 10 800 which was the bottom of the range that First National Bank of Omaha quoted us for a loan I will discuss financing possibilities later in the review The starter is starting to go out It is not not_releasing not_retracting or whatever it is supposed to do We have 50 000 miles on it The cost of a replacement lifetime warranty was 250 Our average distance driven one way to work is 10 miles What I REALLY like is the warning bell when you ve left your headlights on The pockets alongside the doors are handy for maps etc I like the mini storage behind the seats Criteria Before I took delivery of this vehicle I wanted to see what it was worth This is wider in this vehicle than in the Mazda that I am used to driving My large hands barely fit a smaller woman probably wouldnt not_be not_able not_to not_use not_this not_gripping not_method not_as not_the not_airbag not_is not_contained not_within not_Speaking not_of not_airbags

speed manual transmission seems to have enough power for me and can spin tires without even trying We purchased her recently from Jims Dodge Country located at 5402 L St in Omaha It can force you out

not_it not_only not_happens not_SOMETIMES not_but not_not not_when not_it not_is not_in not_the not_shop He has had our business ever since Keith informed us that the parking brake did not not_hold not_on not_our not_new not_Ford not_when not_it not_was not_on not_a not_hill and the brake light on the dash had a short and suggested that we have this fixed at H P Smith Ford as it was still under warranty It is very easy to throw your legs over the bench seat rest your head on the driver window and take a nap Taking a nap in our Mazda pickup cab is a chore compared to this All in all we are very pleased with our purchase We called my bank First National Bank of Omaha and they said they would loan anywhere from 10 800 to 14 000 or so for this vehicle I inquired as to financing and they quoted us 9 1 with my excellent credit I also checked with my insurance company State Farm who quoted us 8 25 on a 60 month loan This truck features a 30 gallon gas tank with 15 mpg city and 17 mpg highway as stated on the original window tag Also I have found that this vehicle has more leg room than my Mazda did I normally would drive the Mazda with the seat all the way back even though many mechanics would move it up I have found that I can drive comfortably with the seat moved forward about 4 inches We do not not_intend not_to not_tow not_anything not_such not_as not_a not_boat

no recalls on this particular vehicle Speaking of seats I work the night shift I make it a habit to take my lunch sleeping in the cab of this vehicle The dealer Jims Dodge Country went through Commercial Federal and was able to get us a 8 1 loan when a day earlier he quoted us a loan rate somewhere in the high 8 range for persons with good credit Another criteria that I had was to have my mechanic Keith Pauley owner of All Pro Muffler and Brakes located at 4646 s 60 St Omaha Nebraska do a free mechanical inspection before the deal was finalized The key can be awkward to turn off as there is an extra lever which needs to be turned off but perhaps it is this way in all Fords 3 10 01 OK not not_even not_one month later I am discovering that the heater control switch the dial which

Pos,OVERVIEW ive been a Ford man my entire life In late April of 2000 I was at an overnight camping party We were at the end of the muddiest minimum maintenance road ive ever seen It was great The Explorer drives well in any conditions I especially likes it 4 wheel drive handling While its only built for four adults comfortably five can still fit except you are short a seatbelt DISLIKES No tent needed just fold down the back seats and throw a sleeping bag back there Well overnight it started pouring and never stopped While everyone else got there cars trucks stuck on this muddy road I flipped into 4 Wheel Drive Low and drove through a muddy cornfield for 5 miles It is just great WHO SHOULD SHOULD NOT BUY I really dont not_think not_you not_can not_go not_wrong not_with not_the not_Explorer not_Sport not_Since not_there not_are not_only not_two not_doors not_dealing not_with not_little not_children not_and not_child not_seats not_is not_probably not_not not_suggested not_But not_for not_singles not_a not_young not_married not_couple not_an not_extra not_work not_pleasure not_auto not_or not_even not_a not_truck not_replacement not_this not_is not_a not_perfect not_vehicle There are not not_many not_things not_I not_do not_not not_like not_about not_the not_Explorer not_Sport not_I not_do not_wish not_it not_had not_the not_on not_board not_computer not_that not_4 not_door not_Explorer not_Limited not_and not_Eddie not_Bauer not_have not_Its not_just not_nice not_to not_know not_exactly not_how not_much not_gas not_you not_have not_left not_your not_mileage not_and not_instantly not_know not_your not_systems not_diagnosis not_of not_potential not_problems not_all not_of not_which not_the not_inboard not_computer not_provides not_DRIVING not_Driving not_the not_Explorer not_Sport not_is not_awesome They truly are the best made automobiles in the world Anyway the 2 door Explorer Sport is definitely my favorite Its an all around great looking vehicle and I always get tons of compliments about it LIKES I am very particular about my vehicles and the Explorer still met all my needs Leather seats power seats and windows moon sun roof cd tape radio deck thermometer compass and rear temp and stereo controls are all the great options I got I think it is very smooth riding even for a SUV
Pos,This is a truck right To all of those who dislike their SUVs think again This is my second Explorer and I love it I purchased this one 4 months ago and have only minor complaints It is not not_supposed not_to not_be not_a not_car not_correct not_Knowing not_this not_why not_did not_you not_buy not_it not_if not_you not_are not_going not_to not_complain This is finally a truck that lives up to the term SUV After owning many cars and not not_having not_any not_luck not_I not_finally not_found not_a not_vehicle not_that not_is not_dependable The only problems that I have had were paint related and that was the dealers fault Seems they scratched it when prepping the car for delivery I feel that the value of this vehicle is better than average As I see it you pay for the power and ability All I can say for the skeptics is if you are looking for a well built reasonably priced truck this is it If you want comfort room and gas mileage buy a bigger truck or get a luxury car cause this aint it The reliability is better than I have seen with other SUVs I traded in my Pontiac Grand Prix Early and am completely satisfied I have been reading a lot of other peoples reviews and am a bit confused I am reading about how uncomfortable or how bumby or how much this car uses gas well just a few questions There are a few things you should know about this truck before buying it It is bumpier than a car it does not not_get not_25 not_30 not_miles not_to not_the not_gallon and it will not not_do not_0 not_60 not_in not_under not_8 not_seconds not_but not_then not_again not_get not_the not_right not_setup and you can pull just about anything drive through or over pretty much all that gets in your way and feel confident that you have lots of vehicle around you The only major complaint I have is that it does rattle a little However I knew that going in to it That is what a truck does
Pos,The extra 30 horses is a definite plus particularly if towing is in your plans Ford Explorer Sport provides a perfect blend between sport utility capability and practicality for everyday use With the back end somewhat shortened over 4 door models one might expect a significant problem with cargo space All in all though I have nothing but praise for this well built capable truck that offers a great blend of four wheel drive ability and normal day drivability On the other hand a larger SUV such as a Ford Expedition or even a 4 door Chevy Blazer for that matter can make a driver feel disconnected to the road and make one nervous when trying to maneuver these battletanks around crowded city streets While smaller SUVs lack the weight size and 4wd ability larger SUVs sacrifice fuel economy and drivability For instance a Honda CRV is not not_nearly not_as not_well not_suited not_for not_rough not_terrain not_and not_or not_snow not_With not_a not_structure not_that not_is not_derived not_from not_the not_Honda not_Civic not_economy not_car not_it not_is not_nowhere not_near not_as not_durable not_and not_imposing not_towards not_bad not_weather This is not not_the not_case not_Explorer not_Sport not_has not_plenty not_of not_space not_to not_hold not_several not_pairs not_of not_skis not_with not_the not_rear not_seats not_folded not_down not_Also not_visibility not_is not_a not_strong not_point not_of not_Explorer not_Sport not_Pillars not_are not_arranged not_in not_a not_manner not_that not_cuts not_down not_of not_blind not_spots not_fairly not_well not_The not_Ford not_Explorer not_Sport not_offers not_a not_great not_deal not_of not_strong not_points not_not not_the not_least not_of not_them not_value not_About not_the not_only not_complaint not_that not_I not_have not_with not_this not_car not_that not_offers not_incredible not_build not_quality not_is not_that not_the not_base not_motor not_is not_uninspiring not_Go not_with not_the not_4 not_0 not_SOHC not_as not_opposed not_to not_the not_OHV not_model
Pos,In September I purchased my Ford Explorer Sport 2000 model No one knows anything about it but this new problem can lead to disaster after time even with the routine maintainance Ford prescribes The catch no one knows how often to have this problem serviced and how to keep the so called wolves at bay because it is a new problem No one would guarentee that my engine would not not_blow not_up nor could I even get as much as a report to the engineers about this problem because Ford doesnt consider it to be a defective engine or the inner workings thereof No one concerning this product is willing to take responsibility for it nor are they willing to replace the engine ect because Ford doesnt want to admit fault with their product at least not not_just yet I am basically driving a time bomb and I would suggest to look for another vehicle to purchase because it is becoming clear that Ford Motor Corporation doesnt stand behind their product as well as it should F O R D Fix Or Repair Daily At first all was well but once we went in for our 8000 oil change everything went straight down the drain Several days later we heard a knock in the engine while the car was in park I quickly called the service department and told them what was happening with the vehicle After having my car for 2 days it was decided that Ford was indeed responsible for this defect although no one wanted to call it that legally but indeed it was Apparently some of these models made for the 2000 year have a high incidence of carbon forming around the pistons and can and will if not not_taken not_care not_of not_completely not_ruin not_your not_engine
Pos,It rides bumpy on the dirt roads and very smooth on the paved streets Off road lovers will love this car The SUV is pretty roomy This SUV can handle sand clay and rocks I usually would drive about sixty on these dirt roads and it drove great My husband bought me a Ford Explorer Sport for Christmas last year and told me that it was going to be our family I was so excited to have a Ford Explorer Sport What I have discovered over the year is that it is a good car to have Its very dependable on and off road I was staying with my parents and where they live theres a lot of dirt roads It would be ideal for a family with child that dont not_have not_to not_ride not_in not_a not_car not_seat not_As not_I not_found not_out not_it is difficult to install a infant carrier and remove it as needed For that reason I wish I had A Ford Explorer Besides that its really roomy As for gas mileage mine gets roughly 288 to 295 miles per tank A tank holds roughly 17 gallons I feel thats a lot of gas for those mileage I do suggest that couples with babies consider the Explorer 4 door instead of the 2 door sport For couples with no children and children that dont not_need not_car not_seats would be a good buy The prices do very depending on the options you get I have seen prices as low as 17 000 00 and as high as 25 000 00 Our SUV was priced at 21 500 00 I was disappointed because it seems like we got nothing for it Our SUV is pretty simple All it has is power windows and power door locks I really wish it came with an alarm
Pos,It hardly feels too big to drive and its very easy to park I love it The leather makes it nice because its easy to keep clean and since im a little short I can slide right in once I hop up high enough Although we paid 3000 more than we would have paid for the Chevy the Ford came with options that made it well worth it The interior is very roomy and since we re starting a family we needed the back seat which ample adult seating and leg room We recently bought a 2001 Ford Explorer used with only 3500 miles on it It has the leather package AM FM CD and Cassette upgraded speakers and power everything Yet after all this negative hype from the media we still wanted to purchase it We love it just as much we thought we would Compared to the Chevy Blazer which we also test drove extensively the Ford was the best bet for the money
Pos,Confession This truck is an awesome tower I am a former member of the I hate SUV club The sound system is the best I have ever had in a vehicle Yes I previously towed with a Taurus Wagon which probably hastened its premature death It does not not_cease not_to not_amaze not_me not_how not_well not_this not_truck not_tows not_a not_3000 not_pound not_rig Oh yes towing I cant not_tell not_you not_how not_many not_times not_I not_could not_not not_haul not_my not_boat not_out not_due not_to not_low not_tides This may be the best vehicle value out there for my needs haul the family boat art dogs and family without mortgaging the ranch The ride is quite and on a flat surface very comfortable as are the FRONT seats Mileage is around 19 all round but this is a big 4 0 engine and not not_all not_that not_bad for its class You do feel every bump on the road and be careful of taking a corner above 45 where there are noticeable bumps in the road But remember this is a Truck not not_a not_car As for the back seats stop winning you bargained for a 2 door and that is what you got saving you a couple of thousand in the process and giving you a much better looking vehicle than the 4 door as well as adding a few miles per gallon There is no strain on this truck at all I am sure this 4 wheel drive monster will be great in the snow and off road if you do that thing I paid 16 900 for this 01 truck with 13 k on it from a dealer There are no rattles which my 95 Taurus wagon specialized in The vehicle seems solidly built I love being so high up Also the vehicle drives with confidence steering is responsive and it corners better than any truck I have been in no roll or lean Beware of overconfidence But having three large dogs a seven year old a 19 foot boat that I trailer a wife who does arts and crafts shows as well as living in New Hampshire I had to revoke my membership and take the plunge for what made sense an SUV I had driven an older 4 door Explorer and a 2000 Blazer Both seemed cushy had roll and lean when cornering and lacked any type of road confidence I test drove the 01 Sport and was very impressed The 01 Sport it has more than adequate power
Pos,No problem here Yet even I am not not_entirely not_immune not_to not_their not_appeal The seat cushion is nearly high enough to provide good thigh support I 146 m personally not not_a not_big not_fan not_of not_large not_SUVs The Expedition is a big vehicle in all dimensions length wide and height On the Road This permits a large interior even after allowing for generous ground clearance In the Explorer the windshield header and sun visors intruded on my vision This permitted the floor to be lowered nine inches a huge amount The point of styling is not not_to not_entertain not_auto not_journalists not_or not_third not_parties The point is to give owners the 147look 148 they want The round forms of the old dash are gone replaced by a more conventional arrangement It was like a billed hat I couldn 146t take off Not quite easy enough for children to manage which might not not_be not_a not_bad not_thing In the second row the truck I drove had a bench split in three pieces To get to the third row either outboard section of the second row tilts forward in two fairly easy steps They could have used the lower floor to expand cargo volume by making the seats removable as before And if every different size cereal box had a different look wouldn 146t this lead to even more confusion in the cereal aisle So I have no problem with Ford SUVs looking alike Inside the Expedition has also been de rounded The cushion is padded and contoured enough so you don 146t feel you 146re sitting on a board For maximum cargo volume though a minivan remains a better choice as the reduced ground clearance and removable seats permit a taller cargo area They are an improvement 151this is a nicer interior than that of the new Explorer 151 but VW is still a ways off The revisions for 2003 have added a few hundred pounds to an already hefty vehicle The lower floor also permits this large comfortable seat to fold completely into it leaving a flat load surface behind Ford faced a choice here The interior is fairly quiet even at highway speeds with one qualification So even with the 260 horsepower 5 4 liter V8 acceleration is just adequate with a moderate load My motivations were a bit more sophisticated than I have let on I knew that Ford had substantially revised the Expedition for 2003 By this I mean it felt neither underpowered nor equipped with power to spare To whit hopefully they need to carry a large amount of people and or stuff over nasty roads or even off road Let 146s cover the capacity issue first This compartment was topped by a padded leather armrest Also nice Smaller storage areas are scattered throughout the interior The Eddie Bauer Expedition I drove had the 147climate control 148 seats It moved as quickly as I wanted to which admittedly is not not_too not_quickly not_this not_being not_a not_large not_vehicle The most prominent features of the new dash are a large swath of black plastic across the driver 146s side and Audiesque rotating metallic finish rings that adjust the volume flowing through the vents My test vehicle had the 455 power folding third row option Worth the 455 Probably not not_to not_me but I 146d suggest personally evaluating the effort involved in the non power version The center console which reduces seating capacity to eight has a HUGE storage compartment in it A small dog could be stored in there or more likely a laptop computer and or good sized purse The moderately loaded Eddie Bauer Expedition I drove carried a sticker of 45 190 Yes quite shocking But corrective actions are possible All three rows have enough shoulder room for three adults to fit with little or no touching A split bench is standard on the first two trim levels up front so an Expedition can be configured to carry nine people The real surprise is in the third row Ford 146s main reason for eating the approximately 200 additional cost of an independent rear suspension was to avoid packaging a center differential with 10 148 or so of travel They appear to have a problem in this area There 146s still a large amount of hard plastic to be found here Accommodations Hopefully people who buy an Expedition do so for reasons beyond an infatuation with size On the positive side the climate control system appears well up to handle the task of heating and cooling all three rows of this large vehicle Pricing Now just about any car claims to fit three adults in the back seat However few have enough shoulder room to fit three comfortably i e shoulders not not_crammed not_into not_each

my review of the Yukon I prefer the Ford Explorer a click for my review I like the new styling much better than the old The rounder front fenders of the first generation Expedition as successful as

going above that level on an engine with a low power peak makes no sense Handling was another pleasant surprise There is something fascinating about vehicles so large probably the same thing that is fascinating about large beasts such as elephants and hippos and large anything for that matter Size is impressive to the animal brain Recently I had a coupon for a free oil change at a Ford dealer They elected instead to keep cargo volume constant 151 and thus substantially less than a minivan s 151 and eliminate the need to remove any seats ever I suspect the great majority of buyers will favor this decision as removing and storing seats tends to be quite inconvenient My reviews of related vehicles a href content 75746086532 GMC Yukon a equivalent to Chevrolet Tahoe a href content 119115910788 Nissan Pathfinder Armada a b a href content 6904319620 Toyota Sequoia a This fall Nissan has entered the large SUV arena with its Pathfinder Armada and Dodge has introduced a new singificantly larger Durango After driving both my preference for the Expedition remains though the Dodge is a close second The new Durango is much quicker than the Expedition feels more maneuverable rides better and costs less Its disadvantages include a less comfortable third row less shoulder room and a cheap looking interior In the Expedition I sat well above the dash affording an excellent view out all around yet the top of my vision was also unblocked Much much better No improvements possible here Huge mirrors were also much appreciated Many cars these days do not not_provide not_enough not_interior not_storage not_No not_problem not_with not_the not_Expedition not_I not_drove The new styling makes the vehicle look stronger and more up to date rounded forms are on their way 147 out 148 without resorting to an overly macho theme i e the Avalanche Some people complain that the Explorer and Expedition look too much alike I don 146t have a problem with this personally This lower floor permits two things First it permits a surprisingly roomy third seat Now many vehicles these days offer a third row seat including many minivans and an increasing number of SUVs I 146ve sat in many of these third row seats I didn 146t sit in them any longer than I had to though With the changes for 2003 the seating comfort interior versatility and handling feel now exceed the closest competition Acceleration some areas of handling and ride quality still lag but among large SUVs this is now my favorite Update November 2003 There 146s also some history here GM used to own the large SUV market Then Ford finally got around to introducing its own full size four door SUV in 1997 and that first Expedition was instantly a success GM responded with its own substantially redesigned large SUVs in 2000 and they 146ve regained some of the lost ground If they want the 147 Ford SUV look 148 and the Explorer is large enough inside then that 146s the way to go If they want this look but need a larger SUV then that 146s what the Expedition is for No one complains that Cheerios uses the same graphics on the 15 oz and the 22 oz box right For many uses a minivan will do as well or better but off road and or travel over uneven or unplowed snow covered roads can justify the space robbing weight adding ground clearance of the Expedition With these qualifications I can recommend this vehicle The upper trim lines including the top of the line Eddie Bauer I drove are fitted with buckets and a center console I found the driver 146s seat fairly comfortable especially after I deflated the lumbar support an earlier driver had pumped it all the way up I found the driving position much better than that in the current Explorer By similarly styling and naming its SUVs Ford presents a clearer image and simplifies customers 146 decision making Finally wouldn 146t it be worse if they looked different and people who only needed a mid sized SUV but really liked the look of the big one were thus forced to buy more gas guzzling truck than they need The Nissan is also much quicker than the Ford but its chassis feels very trucky and its interior quality is abysmal for a 40 000 vehicle I ve noticed that Expeditions front wheels are often thickly coated with black brake dust The new 147 safety canopy 148 airbag to protect the first and second rows in a rollover and 147AdvanceTrac 148 stability control are impressive safety features but together add nearly 1 400 to the sticker I 146ve already mentioned the climate controlled seat and power folding seat options another 1 080 Not yet mentioned is the nicely sized but 800 moonroof The big Toy is more refined but low on power and not not_as not_roomy I prefer the Ford Last Words Generally I 146d still recommend a smaller more fuel efficient vehicle but if you need to carry seven or more adults comfortably there are few other choices and those aren 146t much more efficient The revised styling follows the path set by the 2002 Explorer with the largest change being a less round and more massive looking front end Most intriguing to me steering changed from recirculating ball to rack and pinion and the live rear axle was tossed in favor of an independent rear suspension to improve handling Handling more than any other area affects my satisfaction with a vehicle As in the 2002 Explorer the new rear suspension permitted a much lower load floor promising a larger rear seat These include not not_only heating but also air conditioning each with five strength settings I set the seat A C to 1475 148 but never noticed a difference I would suggest saving 625 by forgoing this option except it 146s the only way to get heated seats and these can be very nice to have on cold mornings with leather You 146re call just know the seat A C isn 146t worth much The a href content 6904319620 Toyota Sequoia a is about equally powerful the GM SUVs have an edge here Towing a heavy load and or carrying a full

be a better way They tend to be uncomfortable and they tend to be mounted so close to the floor that my knees are at chest level I don 146t like sitting like this In the Expedition in contrast the seat cushion is generously sized and padded and is mounted high enough above the lower floor that I had plenty of thigh support move even than in the second row Overall I found the third row seat to be the most comfortable in the vehicle more comfortable than the second seats in most alternatives are far ahead of any third row seat I 146ve sampled Among SUVs only the even larger Suburban comes close Quite an achievement Yet more can be saved by going with the XLT trim where the luxury of leather is still available Equip an XLT to a href content 68354674308 Honda Pilot EX a levels and the sticker drops under forty Still nine grand over the smaller but in some ways nicer Honda but more help is on the way The Honda sells at or above sticker while according to Edmunds Ford dealers typically accept four grand under sticker Add in Ford 146s current 2 500 rebate and the likely transaction price for a still well equipped Expedition comes to just over 33 000 Suddenly the price seems quite reasonable doesn 146t it Even further reductions are possible by doing without leather front buckets and so on GM s full size SUVs such as the a href content 75746086532 GMC The steering and brake efforts were nicely firm where they used to be overly light Roll in turns is moderate Unlike past Expeditions I no longer felt I was driving a boat Not a sports car either but I generally felt

Pos,There is also rear independent suspension No need to haul in and out huge unwieldy third row seats Seat memory The frame is stiffer Outside noise seems to be less The third and second row seats fold down completely flat Storage is everywhere When compared to the competition this was hands down the best option The ride is really nice and the steering is apparently much improved 3 Convenience Id prefer 100 analog except where absolutely necessary 2 No More Noisy Wishy Washy Ride The Eddie Bauer edition even has buttons to lower the third row from the back There are still some of the old Ford here with tiny buttons and green led lights In my 1997 Pathfinder when you hit the sunglass holder button it gracefully slides open On the downside while apparently more efficient than previous models the Expedition still likes to consume gasoline Also while most of the upgrades seem quality a few seem like less than first rate The leather also seems to be a little lower grade than some of the top of the line SUVs e g Acura This is great if you ve got a kid in a childs seat back there 4 Quality I know that I just bought the thing In dash 6 CD Pop down mini wide angle rear view mirror to keep an eye on activity in the aft section DVD for the kids Second row middle seat slides forward It looks like Ford actually listened to the feedback from the previous Expedition drivers strange concept and then built the new Expedition Examples of what I am talking about 1 Design However after extensive research and a test drive of all four I think Ford has the best product for the price Ford really did a good job with the new Expedition To give you an idea what I am talking about and I concede this is nit picky the sunglass holder kind of jumps down at you when you push the button But the fact of the matter is that the Expedition just seems to be built to last No jiggles on the highway and a general sense of solidity 5 Price Maybe I just had a better negotiating experience with my dealer but the price I got it below invoice bringing the 41 000 sticker down to 33 000 Let me first preface my thoughts by assuring you that I do not not_work not_for not_any not_car not_manufacturer not_After not_considering not_the not_Acura not_MDX not_Chevy not_Tahoe not_and not_Toyota not_Sequoia not_I not_went not_with not_the not_2003 not_Eddie not_Bauer not_4x2 not_5 not_4L not_Expedition not_I not_must not_admit not_that not_I not_have not_been not_reticent not_about not_American not_cars not_in not_recent not_years and at first was leaning toward the MDX My primary fear was quality The interior design while still American at heart is clearly not not_the not_same not_old not_Ford not_For not_example Ford seems to have a habit of slapping together a confusing array of tiny plastic buttons and lights and then calling it a dash Did Ford actually think that people like to have a readout that looks like one of those blinking light panels that Spock always used to stare at The new dash really looks somewhat like the new Audi See the air conditioning vents and two tone black and tan dash I just wish they had gone all the way with this concept
Pos,They could not not_believe not_the not_leg not_room The 3rd row fold down seats are the best The center console is HUGE Lots of cupholders even in every door The interior is very driver friendly everything is within arms reach My husband and I went on the dreaded search for the new family car Plus the middle seat in the second row slides forward to be directly up against the console It does tend to slurp up the gas in town but what big SUV doesnt We knew that we wanted an SUV and were leaning toward the Tahoe I come from a diehard GM family We went on a 90 mile round trip with 6 very tall adults and everyone commented on how comfortable it was It is very stable turns on a dime makes us feel very safe Ps My mom is jealous she hates her brand new Yukon This was an answer to prayers I find them very easy to put up or down Overall we are very pleased with this vehicle The seating is the real winner Ford really designed this well The 2nd row of seats are separated into 3 individual seats which allows for any number of seating arrangements It puts a infant right behind you But for those of you without children it allows for the people sitting in the 3rd row of seats to have a ton more leg room We knew that we wanted a 3rd row of seats for those rare times when we would need them but we also knew that we did not not_have not_the not_room not_to not_store not_them My parents have leased 2 Tahoes in the last 4 years and I had driven them frequently I found them to be comfortable however they always felt like they were top heavy when turning corners and such I had read that the new Expedition had come out with flat fold seats and I knew that we had to check this out I have to admit I never thought we would buy a Ford but the minute I drove it I LOVED it It seems to have way more room in it than the Tahoe My husband is 6 4 so we need all the leg room head room that we can get I also love the way that you sit up high it seems to give a better view of your surroundings
Pos,I have a 1993 Ford Probe SE You can barely hear the engine running The car is quick and handles very well On the highway the car is very smooth and quiet The car has power windows power door locks power sunroof and power seats The color is blue green and the inside is black and gray It has approximately 88 000 miles on it It is a five speed The car looks very sleek and very sporty I enjoy driving it every time It has an drivers side air bag and anti lock brakes which are nice to have These are very luxurious and make the car very enjoyable to drive I have the low profile tires for it which are standard on the SE The one thing I do not not_like is that once in a while there is a little rattle inside the dashboard which is common for probes There are plenty of saftey features on car so parents will like it for their children Anyone who wants a big slow car shouldnt not_buy not_it The probe has an equalizer to compliment the stereo which has a tape player I am going to get a cd player for it soon The sunroof is nice to have in the summer just having the air rush in over you The people who should buy this vehicle are people who love speed sporty cars and quickness When I am driving it I definetly feel like I am driving a sports car If I didnt not_know not_it not_I not_would not_think not_I not_was not_driving not_a not_Porshe not_Everyone not_on not_the not_road not_checks not_out not_the not_car not_because not_of not_it not_looks not_and not_style
Pos, I bought a 93 Probe GT in 97 5 speed  no automatic for me  when I first saw the new designed Probes I knew I would someday buy one  so when I got a good job I went out and bought my dream car  At first it was awesome I never drove a car that handled so good or accelerated so fast  everyone gave me compliments on how nice the car looked  But when I bought the car it had 84 000kms 52500miles  and with most cars this is when things started going wrong with it  I will list in order my problems I had 1  o2 sensors the probe has two of them when not working properly the car will use a lot of gas and show a engine lite on  parts are very expensive  note  if you live anywhere where they do emission testing the car will fail with the o2 sensors not working 2  valve cover gasket   oil will leak into the spark plug holes causing the wire to short out  gasket price is cheap but there is a lot of labor involved 3  ABS sensor the car will make a buzzing noise and show the ABS lite on  you can still drive the car like this but the abs will not work parts are expensive 4  water pump there is a lot of labor involved in this job too   I would definitely recommend to change the timing belt when doing this job because the probe has a interference engine and if the belts ever breaks the valves will crash into the pistons 5  Air bag sensor lite  a lot of Probes owners I have talked to have had these five problems the air bag lite sensor is usually the problem but I was told only the dealership can do the diagnostics and they are expensive  Now I know that all cars have there problems but the Probe is special in which almost all the parts on it are twice to three times more than most cars  from the exhaust to the struts  but I think sometimes in life you buy a car that just can not part with and this car is mine  I have heard of a lot of other problems the Probe has  like the automatic transmissions have a lot of problems  But now that the probe is discontinued you can get one for pretty cheap  just make sure you check to see if the previous owner got this work done  above  Just remember parts are expensive  and winter driving in deep snow is not fun due the fat tires and light back end of the Probe  I still own this car today and have no plans to sell it  the probe has it own unique look where most new cars are all looking the same  
Pos,Its a hard ride though and im too poor to replace the shocks and takes some getting used to The tires are dunlops previous owner and have decent grip no fishtailing in the snow and that sort of thing My car is black and I wash wax her every fortnight and I get a lot of appreciative looks for the trouble Shes a good cruiser ive done two trips of 2000 miles and 1400 miles with no complaints whatsoever If you want to buy this car remember that the rear seat is strictly for emergency purposes I dont not_know not_why not_Ford not_put not_it not_in not_to not_begin not_with not_This would have made a great 2 seater At the 90K service I got the rear brakes changed and also the spark plug wires total cost of service 400 or so and since then things have been phenomenal Its a lot of fun to blow off V 6 camaros and mustangs at stop lights even though they catch up with you down the road but I have only praise for the acceleration of this car The niggling points are 1 body noises on all but the smoothest roads thats supposed to be a problem for all 93 probes though 2 the idling screws up sometimes varies between 750rpm and 1200 rpm but gets alright in an hour or so 3 the power antenna is stuck another common probe problem Probes are cheap I have seen 94 GTs with 70 K for about 5000 recently so if you get a cheap deal buy it you certainly will not not_regret not_it not_if not_you not_keep not_the not_car not_well not_Forget not_about not_resale not_value not_though not_you not_wont not_even not_get not_peanuts not_for not_this not_car not_Since not_I not_plan not_to not_run not_mine not_until not_the not_bitter not_end not_im not_not not_concerned not_about not_that not_ive not_also not_done not_a not_lot not_of not_driving not_on not_back not_roads not_I not_think not_the not_turning not_cornering not_capabilities not_are not_pretty not_good not_too I fell in love with the looks of this car the moment I saw one on the road I finally got around to buying one last October 93 GT 73 K miles and I paid 5 K for it Looks like the previous owner hadnt done much with it I got it from a dealer so within a month I had replaced the water pump and the muffler both of which failed on my first long drive in the car Cost me about 600 bucks for everything put together but thats it water pump replacement is part of the 60K service which apparently wasnt not_done not_ive not_currently not_got not_91 not_K not_miles not_on not_it not_yes not_I not_drive not_quite not_a not_lot not_and not_the not_only not_periodic not_expense not_has not_been not_the not_oil not_changes
Pos,In October of 2000 I bought a 1993 Ford Probe GT and it is the best car of its kind I love the front room and the hatch room but no one can fit in back unless they are under 4 I dislike the performance probably cuz im used to my old Mustang 5 0 Off the start it aint to bad but after 3rd you just get blown away if you dont not_have not_mods not_which not_I not_am not_in not_the not_process not_of not_putting not_on not_Overall not_the not_looks not_kick not_ass and I would recommend the car for anyone who doesnt have 60 000 for a corvette
Pos,I bought my car in 1995 It was built in 1993 I was in college at the time and it was perfect for my lifestyle The trunk latch has been broken for the past year or so which makes it next to impossible to put anything in the trunk The lighter was broken for awhile Overall this is a wonderful car if you have a lifestyle conducive to a sports car but no money for a sports car There is very little room for groceries yard stuff and other things that you have to buy when you live in an adult world with a house It is a fun sporty car that was just right for a college girl Since ive been married I wish I had picked a slightly more practical model And the backseat is a real pain in the neck to crawl in and out of I havent given it up though because I love zooming around in it The radio is great the car is comfy and it handles wonderfully I have had more than what I consider average problems with it The brakes exhaust and muffler have all had to be replaced
Pos,The cargo cover still operates and provides added safety and privacy The rear cargo area is very durable with a thick padded carpet The rear seat is like new the only thing on bumpy roads the springs in the rear seat squeak The factory tint or privacy glass is handy in high summer and really sets off the deep forest green exterior with the beige interior It also comes in handy when pulling boats out of slips even without a 4X4 system its still quite a capable vehicle In a hurry to preserve the steel panels of the car I had it repainted and it looks lustrous again Our family purchased our 1992 Explorer XLT in March 2000 from a good friend of ours who had to move across the world The doors and fenders i e anything that doesnt face the sun were left with the original paint and are really shiny UPDATE The 4 0L V 6 purrs every time it is started and never has hesitated and can pull me away from a stoplight with pleasant acceleration The nicely equipped instrument panel is still fully operational as is the radio cassette player Occasionally a tape will jam probably needs greasing up again The car is in the Bahamas and the roof and the hood basically point to the sun and bake for hours on end The clear coat on top finally broke away leaving bare base coat The AM FM Cassette unit which came standard died in the summer of 2003 After a little research I found out the Ford AM FM CD players can be substituted with no wiring changes The aluminum wheels are shiny but the lacquer covering was chipped on the edges following the Firestone tire recall bad mechanic procedures I simply repainted it with regular lacquer and they re fine again Then I hunted eBay for a few months until I saw an early 90s unit which would fit the 92 dash I eventually found one plugged it in and it is fabulous Also the center storage area has two large cupholders and a huge storage area for cassettes and underneath the cassette holder there is an area for CDs or other stuff Exterior treatments are shiny and the chrome glistens in the daylight If you re interested in making this change the radio removed was Ford base part 19 B165 the radio with the toggle style volume knob The Ford base part 18C815 with the rotary volume knob is the perfect change for 91 and 92 model year Explorers The bright beige interior is showing little sign of wear the leather seating is slightly torn on the drivers seat near a seam on the bottom after 100 000 town hopping miles a slight tear is much less than to be expected Ours came with 6 way power seats for both front passengers with lumbar and bolster for the driver and just lumbar for the passenger they re still supportive and comfortable We knew the car had been impeccably taken care of so it was an offer we couldnt pass up After driving around in the Explorer for a few days I soon discovered a new dimension of driving seeing the road ahead Now I rarely go out to drive my fathers car I feel like my rear end is dragging on the road In XLT trim the Explorer fits anyones requirements for a vehicle But you can see this one coming the plastic wears away over time and now the motor just sits there spinning around with no window movement A good Ford dealer told me to replace these with metal washers which have indeed done the trick Next the muffler has begun to break down First the tail end of the pipe started to crumble and now both silencing boxes are on the slippery slope of corrosion I ll have to get this fixed soon Finally the latest issue has been the paint The ride overall is well controlled and with accurate inputs the turns can be made so you dont not_feel not_like not_you not_re not_gonna not_fall not_out not_the not_car not_Shortly not_after not_we not_purchased not_it not_the not_freon not_in not_the not_A not_C not_system not_leaked not_out not_Where not_the not_car not_is not_located not_you not_can not_still not_purchase not_R not_12 not_from not_retailers not_so not_I not_filled not_it not_up not_again not_with not_a not_can not_or not_two not_only not_to not_have not_it not_gone not_in not_a not_few not_weeks not_time not_I not_have not_since not_abandoned not_repair not_until not_I not_can not_find not_myself not_a not_R not_134a not_conversion not_kit not_with not_some not_leak not_stopper not_where not_I not_live not_Recently not_a not_few not_other not_things not_have not_cropped not_up not_that not_are not_slightly not_annoying not_Inside not_the not_power not_window not_motors not_are not_three not_plastic not_cogs not_which not_slip not_anytime not_a not_finger not_or not_something not_gets not_in not_between not_the not_window
Pos,In 1992 So you can see why I entitled this Recycled Explorer It now has 103 000 miles on and still going strong The dealer from which I bought the car tried to correct this problem by installing shims We had problems with vibrations from the beginning which I understand was a problem with most 1992 Explorers I bought my daughter a new Ford Explorer with a promise from her that I drive it until she started college a year later We have had to replace the anti lock brake system and I recently had the rotors replaced but the rotors are a part of wear and tear that you would normally expect That didnt not_work and ive been told that they should not not_have not_done not_this not_This not_is not_the not_only not_major not_complaint not_we not_ve not_had not_with not_the not_car not_Obviously not_it not_was not_not not_so not_big not_a not_deal not_that not_we not_sold not_the not_vehicle When she started to college she took the Explorer with her and I drove another car She drove the Explorer until 1999 when she purchased a 1999 Ford Mustang I sold the car I was driving at the time and took back the Explorer
Pos,It makes quick trunk exchanges very simple The seats mirrors windows and locks are all automatic Oh yeah and not not_to not_forget not_the not_four not_wheel not_drive not_feature It is very comfortable and with all automatic features it couldnt be more simple This too is activated with the push of a button making the shift quick and easy for the emergency situations When looking at other SUVs of its relative size one overlooked feature that I have found to be very convenient is the option on the tailgate for opening either just the glass or the whole door itself My choice on this explorer was great Now to get to the car I would like to say that it has tons of room both in the front seats back seats and rear cargo space The room inside with all the convenient features make this SUV a great purchase for anyone whether it be a family or just someone who likes the extra space for cargo or other needed use looking for comfort and space It has so far been very maintenance free I have had it for just over 5 months now and it has not not_been not_to not_the not_shop not_once not_With not_68 not_000 not_miles not_on not_a not_sport not_utility not_that not_is not_not not_bad And the price was great too I recently purchased a 1992 Explorer December and have loved it I was looking for a SUV but because of financial restraints my options were very limited I have a taste for quality so i couldnt settle for an old or bad looking vehicle especially because of the size of a car investment
Pos,The brakes respond very quickly and straight At city speeds its fine When you do its a bumpy ride and juggly Of course there was the daily tuneups and fixes etc Either that or this is a lemon we got It doesnt really go well up long high hills without overheating The 4X4 in the winter works really well handles any kind of weather conditions My mom bought this SUV a few years ago and its been nothing but trouble We bought it because of its sporty looks and durability and off roading ability The bad thing is that it has gone through a lot of repairs You should see the looks on their faces when I am way ahead of them The seats are alright but in the back its kinda uncomfortable after a while not not_very cushy The steering is crisp and responsive but the power steering groans when you turn it too much The motor and the transmission was already replaced in this SUV and its only 8 years old 1992 The door handle has broken off radiator replaced timing belt broken electrical problems the lights go on and off for no reason The windshield wiper switch is broken and the light switch is in a weird spot Sometimes the oil leeks into the motor and burning of course creating smoke When it gets to high speeds it jiggles around and starts squeaking and you cant not_hear not_the not_radio not_that not_well not_at not_highway not_conditions The only thing is that its really noisy when you turn it on and you have to go outside to switch the switch to go offroad The radio that they give you is fine but not not_great Also the gas mileage is not not_that not_great not_especially not_when not_you not_have not_the not_4X4 not_on not_it not_just not_gobbles not_the not_gas not_up not_like not_crazy not_not not_very not_good not_these not_days not_with not_the not_gas not_prices not_rising When im waiting at the stop line at an intersection sometimes people look at me as a learner who just puts along and avoids everything When the light turns green I leap forward and I beat everybody and zoom ahead So this is a pretty reliable SUV and if you want lots of pep this is the car for you The only thing is that the repair bills is high and your wallet will get lighter Maybe ours was a lemon but its good for a family But we had no idea what was in store Since I have gotten my learners license I was actually allowed to drive this car The Explorer I noticed at first is very very preppy and has lots of horsepower Just stepping on the accelerator and it leaps forward ready for action
Pos,The only thing I wish it had is air conditioning The price I have put in was the sticker price Get list and invoice prices from Edmunds com before you go looking for any vehicles I bought this 4 wheel drive truck in February of 1995 because I liked my 1987 4WD Ranger so much The Supercab has greater room for seat back movement and a larger 4 0 vs 2 9 engine If you can find this truck with reasonable mileage and price go for it It is terrific in snow Tis tough to give the amount paid below cuz I traded in my 1987 Ranger The autolocking hubs and push button on the fly transfer case engagement have worked flawlessly I get 22 24 MPG and the original 265 x15 tires lasted about 65 K miles amazing One does get used to the power of the engine and it now seems a little weak though I am sure it hasnt lost any ooomph The cassette player started refusing to change directions and ended up eating tapes after 4 years 55 K miles I replaced it with a JVC radio cassette 12 CD changer from Crutchfield I then heard vastly improved sounds from the speakers I will buy another Ranger when the time comes or an Explorer if I no longer need a truck
Pos,This is not not_Uncle not_Ernies not_retirement not_car not_its not_a not_rocket not_ride The paint finish is fabu no defects inspected the engine and it is well constructed although they could fancied up the engine area and added a nicer air cleaner i would opt for a after market air filter and canister and nicer trim in engine compartment would help At first glance it looks like you Uncle Ernie in Floridas grand marquis and some other times it looks like the feds or local police are after you but on the other side of the windshield lies magnificent comfort and classic large interior and seating in leather on this sport model Look downwards to the police radio lol and find a leather wrapped floor shifter for its butter smooth 4 speed auto transmission Thats right police and this sport share in the 235 horse power motor 4 6 new modular technology v 8 motor along with real dual exhaust I wish it were a tad bit louder like its big cousin the Maurader but you can add from my research Dynaflow for a slightly louder rumble Gas mileage has been fair to good keeping my feet off the pedal is hard to do especially when you turn traction control off you can lay one hell of a big burnout ala 60s and 70s style The wheels are 17 inchers and the tires Goodyear now if you read my article on the 97 Jetta you ll know that Goodyear tires are somewhat soft and wear faster we will see how these LS model tires work out Ive seen the 2003 Crown Vic Sport and i can honestly tell you that the 2002 is bound to be a classic the wheels on the 2003 are narrower to make way for clearance with the new rack and pinion front end on 2003 models i prefer the 2002 look my self also gone are the plush leather seats they are now ALA Marauder style ribbed leather SO far i have put on 5 900 hundred miles and have had the first service done also i might note that insurance for this car was alot less than most cars thank goodness for Uncle Ernie
Pos,The car also offers poor handling The worse feature of the Escort is unfortunately the safety concerns They are not not_capable not_of not_handling not_very not_much not_bass not_before not_they not_start not_to not_make not_a not_crackling not_sound The speakers do an adequate job of handling any power but again compared to todays standards sound terrible If your looking at purchasing an Escort LX Kelly Blue Book recommends that the car price not not_exceed not_700 not_to not_1100 It was purchased to get three boys to and from college and it succeeded in doing that for 15 years The car is capable of getting more than 320 miles to the tank but you may start dipping into your reserve fuel It has an air conditioning system which provides ample amount of both cold and hot air but when its turned on the engine really loses a lot of power 108 000 miles 3 brothers and 15 years later our little 4 Door LX Hatchback Blue Escort is still capable of cruising down California roads Four days ago however the Escort entered into retirement when I purchased a new car The car has held up excellent throughout the years and is only showing signs a few minor problems now well after 100 000 miles Compared to cars today the LX Escort offers very little in terms of options The tires are small and overall the car is very light High winds have a tendency to blow this car from side to side and you cant not_take not_turns not_too not_fast not_without not_feeling not_like not_your not_going not_to not_tip not_over But the Escort LX did exactly what it was supposed to do It offered a quality car to get you where you wanted to go This car offers no luxury but it wasnt not_purchased not_for not_luxury This is for a car with no major mechanical or body defects I think the car would be perfect for someone on a really tight budget that just needs a car to get them from point A to point It is not not_recommend not_to not_turn not_on not_the not_air not_conditioning not_when not_traveling not_uphill or at times when you need every bit of power the engine can give you The car comes with a standard Ford stereo which is basically an AM FM stereo minus a cassette player The car also offers powering steering automatic front shoulder belts and a warning noise if you leave your lights on The best feature of the Escort has been its gas mileage ive been able to achieve 320 miles on one tank of gas With high gas prices in California refueling my tank every 3 weeks or more was a blessing This car was built before airbags were required in cars and because its so small a massive collision could be potentially very harmful Although the shoulder belts automatically strap on they provide very little safety it seems ive pulled on the shoulder straps violently several times and they have failed to catch im not not_sure if this is age or if it happened when the car was new since the car was passed down to me
Pos,It makes sweet mechanical music The suspension feels very European This car has high limits It is also responsive It loves to rev It doesnt wheeze or sound stressed There is moderate but predictable understeer The shifter is of the notchy variety Mid range torque is excellent for this class The Contours manual transmission is easy to use That includes the Intrigue Some people LIKE the kick from the engine at 3500rpm The clutch is fairly strong and relatively easy to engage At fast highway speeds the steering is appropriately heavy and not not_twitchy The steering is very communicative and adjusts its attitude over various speeds It pulls all the way to the fairly high redline of 6750 rpm It doesnt require much pressure and isnt not_as not_spring not_loaded not_as not_some not_other not_clutches However the stereo is too low in the dash Tasks like passing and highway merging are relaxed fun when you have the Duratec The power the Duratec generates surprises other drivers in their 200hp V6 mid size sedans However after driving German V6s I prefer a smooth build up of power not not_an not_abrupt not_one If you dont not_typically not_drive not_in not_a not_spirited not_fashion you ll still appreciate the Contours driving competence It is difficult to find the Contour in the V6 5spd form at least in my urban location The car is very stable at 90mph and I have managed to take it to 108 The 5spd transmission allows you to keep the Duratec in its powerband for passing and for turns The dashboard has a simple design and buttons are easy to locate The front cupholders are possibly the most pathetic feature in the car As any car geek will tell you a manual transmission allows you to have real fun with a car In 15 months I have had 4 warranty claims The Sport trim level added features like alloy wheels the V6 spoiler fog lamps leather wrapped wheel shifter floor mats The Contours brakes are very good a result of a nice progressive pedal feel and a system that stops the car straight and short While most enthusiasts prefer the rubbery feel of BMWs stick shift the notchiness makes it easy to find the Contours gears At low speeds you can feel imperfections in the road and anything that might get you in trouble Thats a shame What allows the Contour to be compared to the German models is its grasp of the driving fundamentals handling steering brakes The third was to fix a heater blower resistor assembly You can throw the Contour around Its easy to brake before a turn and control the car through the turn with throttle The brakes have a good bite that may surprise you if you are used to the weak stuff GM makes The second was to fix a wiring harness behind the headlight switch What limits the Duratecs appeal is a lack of low end torque and an unrefined transition when the secondaries kick open at 3500rpm The last three were official Ford recalls ADDENDUM 12 17 1999 The first was to replace a strip of trim on the roof But it costs thousands more doesnt handle as crisply and has a meager 2yr 24 K bumper to bumper warranty The door panels in the Contour are completely plastic there should be a cloth leather insert It has a real enthusiasts engine a proper manual transmission a suspension that grips the road well steering that communicates and brakes that stop without incident The Contour is my first stick shift car and I found it a very good candidate to learn on Hondas manuals are probably the best for novices At that point I feel like my driving ability is at its limit rather than the car Even after a tiring day of play the engine and brakes maintain their performance The fourth was to replace faulty insulation in the front bumper crash sensors The toughest argument against the Contour is the VW Jetta The Jetta certainly has a better interior by far and its VR6 engine is a real thrill The stock tires Firestone Firehawks arent performance tires and limit the cars performance abilities Other options I wanted as well but could not not_find not_on not_a not_lot were ABS traction control and a split folding rear seat The Duratec V6 is one of the Contours greatest assets Its not not_a not_perfect not_engine and some close competitors engines are arguably better like VWs 2 8L VR6 but the Duratec helps elevate the Contour from a Tempo replacement to something unexpected for an inexpensive domestic compact sedan What these models have over the Contour are uprate interiors of fancy plastics and bank vault feel as well as brand panache better resale and superior available mechanicals like Audis Quattro and BMWs sporty rear wheel drive It also surprises the college kids in their Integras as you pull away from them I wouldnt not_necessarily not_call not_a not_V6 not_equipped not_Contour not_FAST but it is certainly spirited What makes me and others such fans of the car is its remarkable driving behavior You just cant not_get not_this not_kind not_of not_performance not_and not_joy not_from not_any not_other not_sub not_20 not_K not_sedan It produces few if any surprises and the reassurance it provides might make you pick up your pace a little bit likely without you realizing it The Contour is Americas 3 series The number may become 5 I read in AutoWeek that 1998 Contours are being recalled for frayed accelerator cables You cant not_reasonably not_expect not_a not_17 not_000

not_options not_I not_wanted But the kick is part of the engine design not not_a not_problem and helps give the Contour a little edge a little personality Overall the Duratec is similar to a Honda VTEC engine albeit with less refinement and turbine smoothness but with a more workable powerband While I recommend the Contour with the V6 and 5spd options I do not not_recommend not_the not_car not_with not_the not_4cyl not_Zetec not_AND not_the not_automatic not_transmission One of the best things about the Contour is the availability actually its standard of a 5 speed manual transmission

not_Grand not_Am not_Alero The Ford Contour a drivers car for the rest of us For under 20 000 here is a domestic sedan that can keep up with the entry level offerings from Germany The Contours driving behavior is comparable to the Audi A4 Volkswagen Jetta and BMW 323 i Thats a shame because Ford has a real winner here one that can be made great with some reworking and refinement FINAL NOTE On paper the Jetta appears to be a winner but since you can get the Contour near invoice whereas the Jetta goes near sticker the battle lines blur From a practicality perspective the Contour is less impressive though still capable Together they make the Contour a reason to get up in the morning If horsepower and flat out acceleration were everything Id be driving a Camaro Z28 with its 305 hp 5 7L V8 But as ive said before the Contour is a drivers car not not_a not_stoplight not_racer My heavy right foot is partially to blame but the thirstiness is made worse because of the smallish fuel tank 14 5 gallons Fortunately the Duratec happily drinks regular 87 octane gas There is a convenient storage space for CDs in the center console though the right driver armrest can get in the way While the Contour as a complete package is flawed so is the competition The headlights are abysmal I find myself using the high beams a lot Cabin noise is unremarkable on the highway with some wind and tire noise protruding but nothing out of the ordinary This drivetrain takes all of the life out of the car If you need an automatic stick with the V6 If you can drive stick the 4cyl Zetec is an acceptable

Pos,The thick leather wrapped wheel fills your hands This car is a joy to drive The car steers precisely and responsively Its nicely balanced and very easy to drive quickly The cars receive virtually no advertising and are destined to be dropped after this model year The engine feels eager to run and the revs come up with turbine like smoothness With 1 daughter preparing to get her license and inherit moms 91 Passat I went shopping for a replacement The seats are more sculpted and orthopedically shaped than anything else Ford or any other domestic offers very similar to those found in Volvos This year it comes in only 2 flavors the loaded SE Sport with the quick 2 5 V6 or the very loaded SVT with the VERY quick 2 5 HO V6 The car we bought had the automatic transmission and premium stereo with in dash CD I passed on ABS amp traction control sticker price was 18500 The Contour was the perfect size it ll fit 2 adults in back quite comfortably although 3 will be tight and it has a large useful trunk Shifting is crisp without feeling harsh and the computer has adaptive capability so that the car soon acts as if it could anticipate exactly when you want it to shift The short list got very short however when I decided to consider only cars with timing chains rather than belts Demanding a chain limits your choices to most GM products including the Saturn 4 cyls and the Ford Duratec V6 family It feels very much like the Cougar which is based on this car but has the stealthy innocent look of a 4 door sedan The Contour and its Mercury sister the Mystique qualify as Fords best kept secrets While the interior isnt not_plush not_with not_all not_vinyl not_door not_panels not_and not_no not_chrome not_or not_wood not_trim the car has some nice thoughtful touches such as a fold down armrest for the drivers bucket and door rocker switches for locks amp windows that illuminate at night This knowledge has induced many enthusiast owners of older models to trade in now for the latest model Its a pity to see this car go away because it has sporting yet sophisticated qualities that dont not_come not_through not_in not_its not_replacement not_the not_Focus And given that it was mainly designed by Ford of Europe where it is sold as the Mondeo its character amp demeanor are markedly European making it the natural successor to our old VW Volkswagon has taken its prices so far upmarket that they didnt not_even not_rate not_consideration The local dealer that participated in CarPoint responded with an offer for 17300 or about 3 over cost I feel this is an excellent price for a car with this level of equipment and the deal was made all that much sweeter with a 1500 rebate from Ford
Pos,The sweet tone is like no other Really reflects the power of this car Handling Short clutch many 5 speeds such as the Mustang have a clutch thats really high The SVT was the perfect height Loaded car moonroof leather power windows doorlocks amp seats keyless entry amp trunk release for lights 16 alloy wheels z rated tires It outhandles any car in its price range hands down Even better than cars around 30 k such as the BMW and Audi Sticks to the roads and carves the twisties Etc I test drove the SVT and IMMEDIATELY knew this was the car for me PROS Power V6 200hp 2 5 liter DOHC Made by the same guys who make the Ford Mustang Cobra Wow great mid range and high end power Exhaust The SVT begs to be redlined and the exhaust makes it that much more difficult Winding roads are a blast to cruise on SVT has done a wonderful job with this car Its too bad its to be discontinued after the 2000 production year I would highly recommend anyone looking for a 22 k ish car to check this bad boy out Huge trunk actually is a little too big should have made the back seat bigger Euro styling and feel to the car CONS Road noise at high speeds Back seat Way too cramped Quality the interior plastic and parts seem kind of cheap I have just passed the recommended 1000 mile break in period somewhat babying it I have opened it up since then and am completely addicted I had never considered buying the Ford Contour SVT but I happened to see one at the dealership I thought I cant not_afford not_that But after looking at the sticker and the markdown sticker I seriously considered it As part of a former job I have driven quite a few cars I would have to say at least 100 different models Honda Accord Civic Prelude Chevy Cavalier Beretta Camaro Monte Carlo VW Golf GTI VR6 Jetta Passat Pontiac Sunfire Grand Am Acura Integra Ford Mustang Taurus Escort BMWs Audis Volvos Mercedes Lexus Many SUVs
Pos,The dash was redesigned in 1998 and can still use work Why is nobody buying the Contour My guess is the interior The rear seat is cramped but like the front seat it is very comfortable It never lets the engine strain and always chooses the right gear quickly and smoothly Performance The interior is the only sore spot of this car and especially in back The front disc rear drum brakes are excellent and have a great feel to them The Mercury has a redesigned dash and interior which solve most of the Contours problems The cars suspension holds the car down great and it definitely has a European handling flair The 4 cylinder engine accelerates fairly well but the V 6 is by far worth the extra money Interior The V 6 engine is far smother than the four cylinder and has a great sound to its exhaust This cars performance is the most convincing reason to buy it The sport models wide low profile tires have superb grip The front seats on the sports model are extremely comfortable and really hold you in place when the going gets rough The vent on the passengers side is positioned awkwardly and it is hard to get the air direction right The lower part of the dash houses two very low and shallow cup holders and a storage shelf that can barely hold a pen The power window switches are mounted vertically on the door in a position that makes them hard to use The stereo sounds great but the buttons are small and many serve dual purposes that are hard to decipher The rear is not not_sufficient not_for not_a not_family not_with not_older not_children and the minor details done wrong on the inside affect a persons decision greatly The best model is easily the V 6 mated to the 5 speed manual However if you prefer automatics that transmission is a good choice too The suspension of the V 6 model is definitely stiffer than the base model though it never feels like your riding in a sports car either However if you re looking for a fun to drive comfortable affordable alternative to a Corolla or Saturn the Contour is definitely the way to go The Ford Contour was introduced as a 1994 model and was Fords first attempt at building a world car The Contour was designed and built in Europe and is sold there as the Ford Mondeo Other than those minor glitches the interior is definitely designed for driving and the driving position seats steering wheel and climate control system are excellent Reliabilty Consumers Reports rates the 1999 contour average What model is the best to buy When I was shopping for my car I drove several different models of the Contour I tried a 4 cylinder automatic a V 6 automatic and a V 6 manual I also tried the base and sport models The V 6 is more prone to problems than the four My friend receives a Contour as her company car and has had an electrical problem and a recall on the engine mounts Besides that she is very happy with the car Overall Anyone in the market for a small car should definitely take a look at the Contour If the Contours interior proves to be a problem than take a look at the Mercury Mystique which is basically a Contour but sold by Mercury
Pos,Theres plenty of room for 4 large adults and if you not not_too not_picky not_about not_the not_stereo not_system this car makes an excellent all around car Trunks space As opposed to the the Volkswagon Jetta which I also looked at this car has plenty of power and at about the same price as many of the foreign counter parts So if you re looking for a vehicle that has sports feel both on the road and on the pedal this car is for you I mean you can feel the road and the steering is easily readable At about 18 000 you get a well equipped vehicle with a V 6 engine and performance tires to match Road noise is a little loud and the stereo system leaves a lot to be desired Overall comfort however is very nice if you are under 6 ft 2in If you looking for luxury this may not not_be not_the not_car not_unless not_you not_get not_the not_leather not_package not_with not_power not_seats not_supreme not_sound not_and not_all not_the not_little not_perks not_Its not_an not_ideal not_family not_car not_for not_the not_small not_family not_wife not_and not_two not_kids not_and not_an not_excellent not_singles not_car not_that not_can not_be not_used not_for not_business not_or not_pleasure What can I say theres plenty I put a rack stereo component system 5 units and a computer Gas mileage is pretty good however they only put a 13 gallon tank in the car so it seems like you re filling up all the time I average about 300 miles per tank
Pos,Greetings The opposite was true of the Ford Contour The breeze won that one hands down We drove the Breeze first Inside the Plymouth breeze is deceivingly roomy In case you havent guessed yet she bought the Contour This elusive trait is why BMWs are known as the ultimate driving machine The road feel in a BMW is quite simply the very best in the world There is plenty of room for four 6 foot adults to get comfortable The plastics are definitely rental car grade and the controls do feel unsubstantial and sort of rubbery Time will tell and I must admit that I am somewhat pessimistic about its projected life span Of course neither car would hold a candle to a used Nissan Altima Honda Civic or VW Jetta in my books The back seat even features a nifty fold down and pull out dual cupholder in the back of the front armrest Both were automatics and had power windows door locks and mirrors AM FM cassette stereos cloth interiors and 4 cylinder engines What follows is a blow by blow account of a head to head comparison test of the Ford Contour and the Plymouth Breeze As for power neither car is exactly a road rocket but thanks to its superior handling the Contour feels both faster and much more fun to drive Of course as is typical of Chrysler company products the interior looked and felt like it was put together on a strict under allocated budget She also ruled out the Ford Focus as it too struck her as a little too weird Interestingly she really liked the looks of the Ford Contour One would expect the Contour to have a small trunk and while its not not_as not_deep as that found on the Breeze it is surprisingly large and usable But hey this car wasnt not_for not_me not_My not_pal not_insisted not_on not_an not_American not_car and I personally think she got a great set of wheels for her money Of course the Breezes trunk ultimately is the larger of the two One of the biggest subjective differences between these two vehicles is the quality of materials and level of fit and finish We both felt good about the purchase especially since we negotiated a great deal on the car She is thrilled and she especially likes the styling of the Contour It feels much larger from any seating position even though on the outside its almost the same size as the Contour The Breeze has the nicer looking gauge cluster and more in the way of interior storage compartments The Contour feels smaller both in terms of interior space and overall size Without a doubt the plastics used on the dash are of higher quality than those found in the Breeze On the other hand the Contour was missing something I insist on in any car I drive a tachometer Even with an automatic a tach can be very useful especially in a car with overdrive transmission The back seats are tight for six footers and rear headroom is non existent Hitting a nice bump on the freeway would definitely result in the rear passengers bumping their heads on the roof if they were 5 9 or taller The plastics are super cheap and squeaks and rattles were certainly noticeable The Breeze left us with the impression that we had driven a cheap car while the Contour felt like a shoe string budget BMW wannabe no kidding So which did we choose So as luck would have it after lots of searching for a couple of really clean cars we happened to find one of each on the same used car lot a red 1999 Plymouth Breeze with 24 000 miles and a white Ford Contour with 25 400 miles In all honesty the Ford felt faster from a standstill although we obviously did not not_conduct not_instrumented not_testing not_The not_Fords not_brakes not_were not_definitely not_better not_than not_those not_in not_the not_Breeze not_but not_bear not_in not_mind not_that not_both not_were not_used not_cars not_Surprisingly not_both not_cars not_have not_great not_trunks The Ford felt like it was put together very well in fact if I may be so bold it felt downright European Conversely the Breeze felt like it was good for maybe another 50 00 miles before it came apart at the seams We immediately ruled out the Pontiac Grand Am as she felt the styling was simply too funky for her more conservative tastes especially the dashboard which appears to have been lifted straight out of a sci fi movie I actually like it myself When we took a good long look at it she felt the Breeze looked like a plastic toy especially the grill and mirrors and I must admit that the front end of the Contour is very pleasing to look at The cats eye headlamps are very elegant Apparently the Contour is one of Fords most reliable products The steering wheel in the Contour scored major points with me for its thick meaty feel Conversely the steering wheel in the Breeze is nothing special and is immediately forgettable Despite being direct competitors these two cars feel very very different The Breeze feels more like a typical American car in that it feels large and roomy and it handles like a small boat Road feel is not not_a not_term not_with not_which not_Plymouth not_is not_well not_acquainted The steering is vague and uncommunicative leaving the driver feeling like they are driving a small Buick Conversely the Contour derived from the hugely successful European Ford Mondeo offers the driver excellent road feel For an enthusiast this makes the drive more fun and makes the car more predictable inspiring more spirited driving For the average consumer the Contours excellent steering imparts a feeling of having better control over the vehicle thus making them feel safer You see this all began several weeks ago when my friends car a wheezy old 1987 Ford Mustang was diagnosed as needing a new automatic transmission within the next month or so The car was driveable but definitely on the way out Knowing that I am a car guy she called me up and asked me what she should buy choosing from only compact four door North American models that can be bought for well under 20 000 she was thinking 18 000 or less She also

Pos,So with that in mind price should also be compared The interior is almost exactly the same and the feel of the car is also similar Also to people who do a lot of driving to work everyday its gets good MPG What really surprised me when I started driving this car is how similar it is to the Mystique I was able to drive this car for the past couple of weeks when me and my brother decided to switch cars Is it better than the Mystique Even though they are two very similar cars the added horsepower and cheaper price makes this car a little bit better We paid about the same for the car his being a year newer gave him the advantage I think that Mercury Mystique is a special kind of ford manufacturer so you spend some money on the fact that it is a Mercury Mystique He drove my 98 Mercury Mystique and I drove his 99 Ford Contour I was very impressed with its handle on the road and the little added horsepower that the Mystique doesnt have ive been driving the Mercury Mystique for the last year and have been pleased with the car Things about the car comes with the nice anti lock brakes for all wheels power windows and door locks I think the Contour is the SVT and in the 99 models that particular type of Contour has more horsepower 200 to the SE and LXs 125 it has a V6 engine it has more torque than the other models also miles per gallon which is important now adays is 20 29 city hwy has cruise control and air bags seats now more than 5 comfortably it is a very luxurious ride if I may say so its a safe ride even though it has more horsepower than the Mystique the feel when you drive it makes it just as safe Its hard to explain other than it feels safe when you drive it brother bought it at about 13 000 I would recommend this car to parents who want a safe and dependable car for their children to drive
Pos,What are the pros In retrospect I can give an honest and well experienced review of the pros and cons of this 4 door performance sedan As far as the ergonomics go the trunk is spacious for a car this size and the controls and gauges are all laid out clearly and easy to use Handling is even better generating 0 90 Gs on the skidpad which means you ll most likely exceed your own personal tolerances well before you approach the cars handling limits If you are on a budget and want a 4 door performance sedan this is definitely a car to consider Performance is right up there with most BMWs at a considerably cheaper price For those of you unfamiliar with performance statistics lets just say this 4 door performance sedan will keep right up with almost all V6 sport coupes on the market priced under 30 k and beat quite a few of them in the process The SVTs front bucket leather is standard in the SVT models seats are VERY comfortable and VERY supportive during spirited driving maneuvers Overall steering feel is excellent with only mild understeer once the handling limits are reached or slightly exceeded and the power assist works wonderfully at any speed im publishing this review for those of you who are considering a purchase of any V6 model Ford Contour I bought a 1999 Ford Contour SVT Special Vehicle Team because I like high performance European type vehicles without the high costs usually associated with any Euro model car that fits this description Unfortunately for me but fortunate for others the resale value is about average for a Ford vehicle which means you can get a REALLY good price on slightly read 1 2 years old used models that have been well cared for and even better deals on slightly older models By far the biggest pro is the performance the SVT model offers but even the non SVT models are good performers for those who dont not_want not_to not_pay not_the not_premium not_attached not_with not_the not_limited not_production not_runs not_that not_come not_with not_all not_SVT not_cars not_Car not_and not_Driver hustled the SVT from a standstill to 60 MPH in just under seven seconds 6 9 and through the quarter mile in 15 4 seconds at 91MPH So what are the cons Mostly fit and finish in the interior areas ive also noticed some suspension noises clunks and rattles especially during the colder seasons of the year Interior noise isnt not_up not_to not_par not_with not_most not_cars not_even not_in not_its not_own not_price not_range not_Cup not_holders not_are not_horrible not_up not_front not_and not_non not_existent not_in not_the not_rear not_there not_are not_inserts not_that not_Ford not_sells not_that not_solve not_the not_problem not_up not_front not_though not_Interior not_lighting not_leaves not_much not_to not_be not_desired My initial test drive of the 1999 Ford Contour SVT made me smile which isnt not_all not_that not_easy not_to not_do not_when not_it not_comes not_to not_cars not_I not_demand not_a not_vehicle not_that not_can not_REALLY not_perform not_and not_handle not_well not_in not_the not_twisties and at the same token deliver good looks and carry four people with relative ease I purchased my 1999 Ford Contour SVT new in December of 1998 it is now November of 2000 and I currently have 42 k miles on the odo There is no glovebox light a REAL inconvenience at night to say the least and no rear passenger lighting exists either Rear brake noise has been an issue for me personally from time to time as well Dependent upon whether or not not_you like it you may or may not not_appreciate not_the not_exhaust not_engine not_noise Keep in mind this car and especially the SVT model is designed with the performance enthusiast in mind so the exhaust and engine are tuned accordingly I personally love the growl from under the hood and from the exhaust Overall I think the V6 1999 Ford Contours are great contenders in the market segment for which they compete
Pos,The trunk is large and roomy enough to carry luggage for four I recently spent a week with a 1999 Contour SE on a 3000 mile vacation It is a very roomy car with all the features of a more expensive car When I first picked up the car I thought that it would be a total drag I was pleasantly surprised though Though billed as a 5 seater four can sit comfortably I have also driven V 6 Contours in the past however the 4 cylinder wil be more than adequate for most peoples needs The ride quality is excellent and managed 400 miles per tank with a lot of highway driving at speeds of 80mph Mountainous driving requires manually shifting the automatic to get the most out of the 2 0 4 cyl engine Braking is sure with no fade even after driving down a 8 grade for two miles
Pos,I just purchased a Ford Contour LX The only two complaints I have about the Contour are small Two is that the cup holders are positioned a little too far away from the driver Two inconviences yes but not not_enough not_to not_deter not_a not_sensible not_buyer not_away not_from not_this not_great not_buy One is that when you pop the trunk it is a little heavy to lift The Contour was not not_only thousands cheaper but I actually thought it drove nicer than the other two The in dash CD player produced a sound that make the Camarys radio look like a alarm clock in comparison But after just driving around the block I was sold I was amazed at what a great car you can get for so little I looked at the Honda Accord and the Toyota Camary but they were both overpriced It is a 1999 model and cost 11 500 I got a great deal considering their was only 9 000 miles on it At first I was somewhat hesitent to test drive it because it was an automatic and I usually hate automatics
Pos,That was a pleasant surprise On dry pavement the handling is excellent Theres no major or minor problems to date This car is a GT Premium which has 260 horsepower as advertised The road needs to be felt when drying hard and fast Price It is above the standard model but its about 3 800 more than the base model If I expected to have 2 or more adult passengers regularly I would not not_purchase not_this not_vehicle My 1 recommendation pay the extra money for the GT if you can its worth every penny and then some Power acceleration That surely improves handling significantly above the standard trim level ive hugged some tight curves with excellent grip on the road It has more horsepower because of the modification Handling I am very happy with this rear wheel powered vehicle Keep in mind this version of the vehicle has 17 performance tires The acceleration in this car is quite phenomenal im more than happy with it ive added an American Thunder cat back exhaust system to give it a really cool growling sound under open throttle The ride is not not_overly not_uncomfortable not_for not_a not_sports not_car not_I not_love not_the not_feel not_of not_control not_obtained not_from not_a not_sports not_car not_as not_opposed not_to not_the not_floaty not_feel not_of not_comfort not_and not_luxury not_vehicles The price I paid includes all taxes and fees 24 000 for the GT Premium that deal was through carsdirect com which by the way provided fine service and stuck to their price If you want to take advantage of the full power of with this car your gas mileage will suffer gt its unavoidable but its never gone below 14 5 MPG for me Comfort and interior im definitely used to the black leather seats and power everything My dog loves the back seat The rear view mirror is slightly obscured by the spoiler and the side mirrors are slightly obscured by the body form in the back it took some getting used to backing up into a parking spot Climate control is fine and the 400 watt stereo is very clear at the maximum volume level which is awesome Only time will tell Keeping the zinc yellow clean is more challenging but it is well worth it its an outstanding color and gets noticed I wonder how long my clutch is going to last I surely make it suffer when I have fun with the car Its doing good so far Gas mileage The gas mileage can average as low as 14 5 MPG during a week with above average traffic problems I drive about 3 4 city 1 4 highway and the average MPG per tank goes up to about 17 5 18 when there havent been significant traffic problems on the commute Surprisingly the cruising MPG averaging about 65 for 1 000 miles I received 26 27 MPG On wet pavement care must be taken Spinning the tires is fairly easy during heavy rain when accelerating onto a highway Beware of your usual high speeds when turning in wet rain and leave plenty of space ahead for braking Breaking on dry pavement is very good the 4 wheel anti lock disk brakes had been used in an emergency situation once with maximum sustained pressure and they lived up to their expectations Deceleration from 50 0 on a tight curve was better than expected Maintenance and Upkeep After 8 000 I am very happy
Pos,The back seat is not not_comfortable not_for not_adults The goodyear eagle LS tires are surprisingly squeal resistant The feel of the car is extremely solid This allows pushing the limits without attracting much attention You can do even better on the highway with cruise control The powertrain 3 8L V6 with 5 speed is flexible and torquey There are no squeaks or rattles and the materials seems very robust The brakes are decent but not not_on not_par with Fords SVT vehicles Or are you on your way to the Ford dealer already Get a Mustang As the rpms build past 3500 so does a considerable amount of horsepower The fit and finish is good but some interior parts show uneven gaps between panels And the rear live axle can occasionally make the back of the car feel a bit sloppy The Camry conformity group will try to co depend you into their faceless society of stellar reliability They will stop the car but are not not_made not_for not_the not_abuse a racing car might see The car will chirp the tires in second and third if you are not not_smooth not_with not_your not_shifts It will revive your love for driving Or get a Camry so it can steal your soul The car is happy to cruise at 90 to 100 MPH but is governed to 115 MPH top speed To be objective there are areas for improvement Wind noise is noticeable but not not_excessive By and large fit could improve but this years Mustang shows Ford does care about quality These gripes withstanding it is clear that no other car can match the Mustangs equipment performance and comfort levels at this price Any questions The gear shifter feels like it is part of the transmission it is and the engine seems composed and strong even with the throttle wide open The Mustang coupe in premium trim offers a lot for a low price Present 3 k rebates make the car a steal at about 17 K Philosophy moment Owning a proud American car takes a bit of self esteem As a long term member of the 100 MPH club I can say that this is fast enough to pass 99 99 of the cars on the freeway For this type of vehicle gas mileage is respectable ranging from 22 to 26 mpg on average It is too dull a life for the expressive and passionate driver Key attributes 193 horsepower 225 ft lbs of torque 225 55 R 16 tires 5 spd with traction control 4 wheel disc brakes with ABS Mach 460 6 disc CD changer 6 way power driver seat Leather wrapped tilt steering wheel From the list above it is clear you get a lot for your money in the Mustang Coupe Premium Further the trim and badging are tasteful subtle and true to the Mustang images so familiar to most Americans Handling is predictable and mild mannered in dry conditions
Pos,But I had no trouble opening the door in a hurry Go back to the drawing board guys and make it beautiful again It also had a back seat so I could pack friends or stuff But that did not not_deter not_me not_from not_wanting not_to not_get not_another not_one I wanted a Ford Mustang Convertible for years ever since I got my drivers license But I was alive I read later in Consumer Reports that many people have had similar experiences with the Mustang big tires big engine in wet weather When the 95 model came out I thought it was the most beautiful car on wheels that I could afford of course And not not_only did the airbags save my life they prevented injury I had had the car for four years and it didnt not_have not_a not_scratch not_Now not_it not_was not_gone In my opinion the Mustang of the 70s and 80s was one sad looking underdeveloped machine a far cry from the hot innovative little pony car of its beginning I hope that the Mustang of the new millennium will not not_share not_that not_fate It had a powerful V8 engine gorgeous design lines leather interior an automatic top so I wouldnt not_have not_to not_wrestle not_with not_folding not_and not_unfolding not_some not_unwieldy not_thing not_it not_had not_a not_glass not_window not_in not_the not_back not_with not_defroster not_so not_it not_wouldnt not_get not_scratched not_like not_a not_plastic not_one The air bags deployed perfectly and although I had to get out and run from the dead car to avoid being hit by oncoming traffic I was virtually uninjured Both the front and the back end of the car were smashed and twisted and virtually gone You can make it powerful and hot looking without making it look like a shark Start with your 94 96 models I still havent bought a new car and the moneys burning a hole in my pocket and im itchin to feel again the way that car made me feel It was my dream car I kept it cherry with weekly detailing In 1999 I totalled my dream car because the combination of the huge high performance 17 tires and the powerful V8 engine although a blast to drive on dry pavement were a disaster in wet weather I was going below freeway speeds when I hydroplaned spun out and hit the center divider twice It was still the only car for me But the 99 model is ugly Its lines are no longer powerful sleek and lovely but sharp angular overly aggressive and masculine ive looked at it and looked at it and the design is just repulsive Its still a Mustang its still a great car but it cannot not_compare not_to not_the not_look not_of not_my not_95 not_I not_am not_dismayed not_that not_the not_designers not_at not_Ford not_are not_again not_on not_the not_downhill not_slide not_with not_the not_Mustang
Pos,The back seat area was small The only draw back for this car was the comfort level for long trips We traded in my Mustang for a 1997 Ford Explorer when my due date approached Only a petite woman could sit back there comfortably for any long period of time The head rest on the front seats were to far back to recline and enjoy the ride As long as you were driving it was fine but the passengers were not not_as not_comfy It handled like a dream with 3 passengers that engine pulled us right up the Sierra Nevada Highways passing people left and right It was a great commute car with good gas mileage I could go a week traveling 60 round trip miles a day on one tank of gas This was the first new car I ever purchased it was my dream car My 1995 Ford Mustang 2 Door Coupe was Forest Green with Saddle tan interior The 6 cylinder 3 8 liter 145 horsepower engine was all the power I needed Sure I would have liked to have had a bigger beefier engine but did I need it No I have the two speeding tickets to prove it I only had my car a couple weeks and we decided to take it on a road trip up to the mountains to show it off to my parents It was going to be too difficult to get a child in and out of the back seat Let alone all the stuff that goes with one in the trunk area I really miss my car and breathe a sigh of regret every time I see one on the road Hopefully one day in the future we can get another one I will bet my daughter would love one when she starts driving Fourteen more years wonder if I can wait
Pos,Also due to the tight suspension potholes can easily mess up the wheel alignment ive corrected this twice in five years Wanna get hold of a fun fast car thats fairly good on gas has a great reputation as an American classic and holds up well over a five year period Then the 1995 Ford Mustang is for you I bought my Mustang in Dec 1995 one year after the re designed Stangs came out My little champ is a basic model V 6 3 8L engine that still performs like the day I brought it home from the stable The engine is top notch the transmission excellent a none worse for wear under carriage relatively rust free exhaust system and good body still makes for a beautiful ride in this classic car A few cons include limited cab space I wouldnt not_recommend not_this not_car not_to not_people not_over not_6 not_4 not_im not_6 not_2 and the back seat is very cramped only good for little kids really It gets good gas mileage 20 city 27 hwy has great suspension corners awesome and has been relatively trouble free ive recently turned 80 000 miles by October 1999 A few parts that ive replaced include tie rod ends struts serpentine belt and tune up parts just did that myself about 3 months ago and 4 new tires last year Other then regular oil changes there have been no major corrections needed for my Mustang
Pos,On the inside it seemed extremely roomy The standard engine in the 1997 Ford Probe is a 2 0 liter 16 valve DOHC inline 4 cylinder The upholstery was made of a cheap looking plastic and appeared to snap into place everywhere The seats also available in leather were made of cloth and provided individual bucket style seating If you 146re looking for that it might be wise to start elsewhere It also sported a factory spoiler which helped to complete the car 146s small compact design When changing the oil I immediately discovered that the oil filter was located in a HORRIABLE place If you keep your eyes peeled you could pick up a great steal for right around 3000 4000 The car 146s governor kicks in at 115 MPH at right about 5200 RPM Braking was decently quick responsive and smooth That didn 146t exactly thrill me but it was going to have to work The engine crankcase was based almost directly in the center of the engine bay and seemed well proportioned for a 4 cylinder It came factory with a cheap tape deck which I yanked out within weeks of having the car Running the air conditioner takes an extremely dampening toll on horsepower and appears to make the entire car 146s operating performance more sluggish This can be fixed but requires taking the door apart to apply 147 buffers 148 along the windows path p Options However since then there has apparently been a drop in the marketing price and the prices have dropped through the floor The trunk helps to tally up yet another plus for the Probe offering ALOT of space to store move stuff But if you 146re in the run for more power and somewhat upgraded or better styling you might wanna slip into a GT However another negative you that may very well hear from multiple Probe owners is the infamous rattling sound coming mostly from the back hatch area While this car does produce a good amount of horsepower and pull for a 4 cylinder it is by no means a powerhouse It obviously would prove to be much quicker and yield more power in about every aspect It 146s styling is amazingly intricate and for it 146s day in age seemed much more aerodynamic then most of the running competitors While it didn 146t offer the ground effects or better looking rear bumper then the GT model it did still sport the same front bumper However that was before I ever tried to get into the back which almost didn 146t even exist because of its tight quarters While the car is manufactured under Ford 146s name the engine itself and most of it 146s components and counterparts are actually produced by Mazda At the time I bought my Probe you could find most of the 1997 models ranging anywhere between 3000 to 7000 depending on mileage shape and overall condition As mentioned previously teamed up with its excellent level of visibility it makes for a very easy and effortless driving experience when weaving in and out of traffic The final standing question would be if you 146re willing to give this enigma a chance At the flywheel it produces 118 horsepower while it is closer to about 100 horsepower at the wheel Redlining at 6500 RPM it 146s apparent that it 146s not not_a not_Ford not_engine On the average I 146ll normally get about 29 miles in town and almost a whopping 35 MPG on the highway Cruising on the highway creates a very comfortable and smooth ride ranging the smoothest from 45 to 95 MPH However my car was not not_equipped not_with not_the not_optional not_ABS not_Anti not_lock not_Brake not_System not_so not_i not_146 not_m not_not not_really not_able not_to not_comment not_on not_that not_aspect not_Turning not_and not_cornering was yet another strong point for the car making it extremely maneuverable When it comes to gas mileage the Probe does put forth an extremely good effort Stats for the car read 25 in town and 29 on the highway My person findings have been must better While repairs can range from pricey to ridiculous the car itself is almost more of a mystery then anything The back seats could be put down to allow for more room I was once able to fit a whole 10 speed bike in the back end with no problem at all and room to spare i Inside They were very comfortable but after a few long trips I found them to be a little odd in shape and hard on your neck Mostly because there is no separate headrest to be pulled up or down If you 146ve got your hopes set on a Probe I might suggest looking into it 146s more expensive and step up GT model sporting a 164 horsepower 24 valve Quad Cam V 6 p Performance Ride Quality However because the large amount of glass fogging of the windows can start to become a problem Especially during the wintertime you may find yourself waiting and waiting and waiting even longer just for your windows to defog However it disappointingly did not not_come not_with not_premium not_rims not_or not_even not_alloy not_rims not_at not_that not_It not_146s not_hubcaps not_were not_very not_loosely not_attached not_to not_14 not_148 not_black not_steelies not_and not_looked not_like not_one not_of not_the not_worst not_designed not_I not_146d not_ever not_seen As for road stats completely stock my Probe was running about around a 17 8 89 MPH in the Ford 146s recorded road test records slightly better results but this is about what you would expect from a 6 year old car In my opinion the driving display was seemingly a little plain but has everything that you could need to know while operating the car Consisting of MPH RPM Oil Level Engine Temp Gas and Battery I found that it got the job done Its taillight brakelight display pattern was clear bright and consisted of a 3rd brake light on the upper border of the hatch window Pop up headlights were extremely smooth looking at the time but because of maintenance became more of a nuisance over a good period of time Just about 2 years ago I re entered that oh so wonderful market of used car searching Having driven a 1990 Bonneville for the last 3 years of my life I was ready for something a little sportier Because of insurance Mustangs Eclipses and Cameros were instantly out of the question In my personal opinion I am planning on sticking with Probe until it 146s end However if you are looking to a Probe don 146t make the same mistake I did Maybe the 4 cylinder model is perfect for you and gas mileage means much more then performance But when it all comes down to I can 146t completely rip on the Probe too much because it has got me from here to there with some style and has never left me stranded At the time power didn 146t matter to me as much as looks Finally I stumbled upon the car that would soon become mine through the good times AND the bad It was indeed a 1997 Ford Probe p Appearence i Outside From the start this was without a doubt the factor that sold me from the beginning The 1997 Probe like any other car could come fully loaded or bare to the bone Some of the available options are as follows Power Seats Power Windows Power Door Locks Power Mirrors Powered Sunroof ABS Anti lock braking system 4 Wheel Disk Brakes Premium Sound System w equalizer Spoiler Premium Wheels or Alloys Rear Window Wiper Ground Effects Side Airbags Keyless Entry Cruise Control Fog Lights Leather Seats Sports Suspension and Intermittent Wipers My specific model was a manual transmission so I found it to be awfully peppy off the line I also found the engine to be extremely weak and it tended to struggle on just about any hard acceleration applied below the 2000 RPM line Once you got to about 3500 to 4000 RPM is where the power band begins to kick in and is short lived to about 5500 RPM It is because of this reason that even Ford dealerships aren 146t able to answer some of the problems that tend to occur p Overview After all is said and done it all comes down to personal preference and choice Would your money be best invested in this Mazda Ford discontinued hybrid or spent it elsewhere Well that 146s really for you to decide It 146s wiring was easily noted and color coated However unless you have a work manual telling what you what is what that doesn 146t really help much Another huge plus of the car was its overall visibility from the inside Since it is a hatchback it 146s comprised of many good sized windows Because of this small factor backing up and maneuvering on the road was made simpler and more worry free At night the display was seemingly a little dark and only emits but a small green glow which can be adjusted by the intensity knob Its single overhead dome light doesn 146t create much light in pitch black instances but was sufficient enough for the time being i Engine Bay Under the hood I found there to be alot more open space then I was expecting Wiring however was kinda messy with tons of stray wires running every which way and appearing in no logical order or pattern When I first got my Probe it purred so quiet that you could hardly hear it running No sudden drops in RPMs were present nor spark or engine knock Now about 2 years after it was purchased 86 K miles at time I 146ve got 123 K on her and she 146s still running smoothly Some spark knock has occurred but is quieted by using plus 89 octane grade gasoline Under my experience the engine is extremely reliable and has yet to leave me stranded or screaming at my car While other rattles are present the most obvious by far would be from the back I 146ve tried multiple times to find out exactly what it is that caused this and have yet to come up with an answer Also while on rattles the windows start to come into play Since they are rimless windows they don 146t have a base or track that they follow when rolled down Because of this even when rolled all the way down they tend to rattle inside the door If fog lights were not not_included not_on not_your not_model but are desired you will be happy to find that the harnesses for it 146s wiring was still ran through the car making it easy to plug the factory fog lights button up to custom fog lights Swapping out the factory Tape CD Tuner is made very simple because of its economy standard sized opening which requires no special harnesses Many of the other options can be added as well rather it be by use of aftermarket parts or even managing to find order original factory parts from Ford Prices To reach it you must run your arm almost 3 feet deep in the engine bay from the bottom up and this included sliding your arm by the exhaust manifold and piping BAD idea Because of its extremely high temperatures you must let the cat sit on ramps for almost 1 2 hours before you even dare stick your arm up by it While on the topic of heat the car 146s engine tends to run extremely hot While the temperature gauge reads that it 146s in normal range it is a VERY hot engine and must be allowed to cool down for a good amount of time before working on Engine Stats However when taking in account of the car you had best put a good amount of money aside because this car has been known for it 146s expensive repairs p Repairs Within months of owning the car I was sadly introduced to the number one gripe of owning a Probe Prices tend to be 2 3 times as much as they would be on say a Taurus or Escort Reason for this would most likely be because when the Probe came out it had a very rare set of tools that were needed to work on it Since it 146s a Ford Mazda hybrid it was a total mess when it came to trying to using tools for only Fords or only for Mazdas Also it 146s not not_exactly not_considered not_a not_plus not_that not_this not_car not_was

Pos,The controls are all in easy reach of the driver and passenger We like this car because of its looks as well as its design We have the 5 speed which for a car in this price range is surprisingly agile This car has held up through long road trips cramming with luggage and a couple of small fender benders Would be suitable for a teenager the gas mileage is great the car is reliable and it has dual air bags The engine is a high revving engine that most people can have some fun with All in all a good car for the money We have the 4 cyl engine which is not not_the not_most not_powerfull not_engine if you like this car but want power get the GT The car could use bigger tires and wheels to help it stick to the road but the suspension is good and firm in most turns My wife bought this car 4 years ago Jan 97 and we use this car as our around town car Other than tires oil and brakes we have never had this car in the shop
Pos,It gets good gas mileage even at this late stage This 1989 Ford Probe is a sporty and spunky little car The paint has held up very well for an eleven year old car It is very easy to get a rock in the condenser It is fun to drive but watch out for tickets It blew a timing belt but when replaced it ran great This problem was my fault as I was aware that timing belts should be changed periodically The air conditioner has been the only problem and that is because there no protection in the grille It continues to get 29 miles to the gallon and the spark plugs have not not_been not_changed not_in not_2 not_years The 1989 Ford has quick pick up with the turbo engine and it gets in and out of traffic with little trouble It is reliable and always ready to run My 1989 Ford probe has 212000 miles on it to date I have had very little trouble with the engine This is the car for someone who likes the sporty look likes the feel of a car is interested in reliability and value and may want to keep it for future appreciation This can be eliminated by putting in a screen to protect the condenser I would rather have this little stick shift model then a new one I believe the 1989 Probe will be considered a classic in later years and I am going to hang on to this one
Pos,One thing I dont not_like is the programmed keys The controls are exactly the same and I mean exactly We got a bedliner installed by them and its very nice My husband recently traded our 1996 B4000 Mazda for a 4 door Ranger V 6XLT 4wd We had one bold break and one loosen frequently on the armrest in the Mazda This truck has 4 doors but not not_full not_size not_doors not_that not_make not_you not_lose not_bed not_space He got the single CD stereo which has very good sound and easy to read buttons They have since added bracing on both sides of the armrest which makes it much more sturdy There is also an airbag turn off switch for when you need to have children ride up front They make it easier to store things behind the seat as well as being easier for passengers to get into the back No new trucks seem to come with a bedliner and im quite sure why seeing how expensive the trucks are and they save the paint This is fine since everything is laid out well and is good quality Several things have changed on the inside like the steering wheel is a little thicker which is more comfortable We loved the Mazda but it was getting lots of miles on it and wanted something new The Mazda and Ford are the same vehicle basically and we knew we had good luck with the Mazda for years The back is still not not_the not_most not_comfortable not_spacious not_ride but its okay for short trips I personally dont not_like not_the not_seats not_sitting not_sideways not_in not_the not_back not_as not_it not_can not_make not_you not_feel not_sick not_on not_twisty not_roads not_but not_we not_dont not_use not_them not_much It was pretty easy though Its supposed to make it harder for thieves and is considered an alarm system Its a good truck that has been relatively unchanged for many years which shows that it is an idea that works They are 25 plus 25 for programming if you have them do it We bought 3 extra keys and programmed our own but it was pretty scary because we didnt not_want not_to not_mess not_it not_up not_and not_have not_to not_have not_it not_towed not_40 not_miles not_to not_the not_dealer The biggest and best change is the engine Its the same size but more HP with more get up and go Its also geared differently manual where you can be in a higher gear at a lower speed which has been a good thing with all of the snow and ice we ve had The 4wd is great and can take you anywhere you want to go It rides like a truck because it is one but the ride in the new one is much tighter and takes the bumps a whole lot better
Pos,You will not not_be not_disappointed It looked very tough and extremely Sporty It handles well and does great off road The stylish improvements and interior do a great justice to this Truck Take offs from traffic lights are more than adequate The wind noise is average The Nissan I test drove was much worse Too much for a car in my opinion I immediatly noticed the truck on the showroom floor It matched the foreign competition in every way except was typically 3 5000 thousand dollars cheaper Good luck It sits at the same level as the Explorer Overall I recommend the Ranger Extended Cab 4x4 4 0 V6 The internal controls are easy to reach and attractive I opted for the 6 disc in dash CD player My two daughters like riding in the back but I can tell the novelty will soon wear off If you are in the market for a small SUV or pick up try this out in your search Be advised I am a 36 yo white collar professional not not_an not_18 not_yo looking to buy his first truck The salesman was steering me toward the new Escape yuk The Escape is boring inside and out I kept going back to the Ranger After a long solo test drive I was sold I love it My truck has a great look and definitely turns heads I trade in a 95 Ford Explorer Sport 4x4 I have to tell you that I already miss the full back seat It reacts a little to slow for my taste but the sound is clear it makes highway driving fun I play music loud and cannot not_hear not_anything not_going not_on not_outside not_the not_truck not_I not_especially not_like not_the not_way not_Ford not_increased not_the not_Rangers not_height The Explorer had more power and the turning radius was much better however at 83000 miles the gas mileage was horrible I went to the Dealership with the intention of buying a new Ford Explorer however the 30 sticker sent me looking for something cheaper I looked at the new Sport and Sport Track but like its big sister the price with options put it near 30 k
Pos,And it retains its value better than 90 of all the other vehicles on the road No wonder it 146s the number one selling compact truck it sure gets my vote Of course serious truck lovers wouldn 146t consider anything but a 4X4 why because they 146re macho For one thing there was more engine noise and a much choppier ride than in my far older 2 wheel drive truck Here you 146ll find easier entry since it 146s lower to the ground in addition to a much softer ride However this model was exactly what I was looking for as it contains a hose me out interior The Edge with its vinyl floor and seats is one heck of a lot easier to vacuum and keep clean It can haul wood cruise effortlessly on the highway or carry campers through some of the worst terrain without taking a deep breath It lacks some of the finer things you 146d consider indispensable in an automobile such as tilt power windows and locks keyless entry etc And after all this is a truck not not_the not_family not_go not_to not_Sunday not_meeting not_luxury not_vehicle not_Having not_said not_that not_I not_must not_admit not_I not_was not_somewhat not_disappointed not_with not_our not_test not_drive not_of not_this not_vehicle The fun to drive aspect is hard to measure Ride is toward the harsh side but the truck handles incredibly well and doesn 146t feel the least bit tippy unlike many SUV 146s The Ranger is literally bullet proof from a mechanical standpoint Combine that with its good looks rugged suspension right size flexible utility and fun to drive aspect you have one heck of vehicle Point being if you don 146t live in snow country unless you 146re into status that is you 146ll be a lot more comfortable in a 2 wheel model They just look bigger and meaner with their taller stance and huge tires Often owning a 4X4 is all about image not not_necessarily not_need not_Maybe not_some not_of not_that not_was not_true not_with not_us not_too not_as not_the not_Edge not_4X4 not_is not_one not_mean not_looking not_vehicle The extra room the 4 door cab offers is great for hauling around my constant companion a German Shepherd named Barney Barney seems to have 3 times more hair than any dog his size would require most of which he 146d leave behind where it would stick fast to the seats and carpeting of the previous truck The difference was very noticeable so much so we went home without purchasing the truck much to the chagrin of our sales person I guess we just weren 146t prepared for the difference you 146ll find between the 2 wheel version and its bigger 147at least taller 148 4X4 brother After some discussion my wife and I decided even though we preferred the 2 wheel suspension a 4X4 would be better suited to our current needs Seats are very comfortable wind noise is minimal I have noticed some creaking noises undoubtedly attributable to the 4 door design that lacks the stabilizing nature of a center post As noted earlier the vinyl interior of the Edge makes cleanup a breeze Nevertheless it does make one wonder why Ford had to pad the seat backs with a velcro like cloth that nearly defeats the clean ability feature for dog lovers It just says 147 drive me 148 when sitting in our garage I consider the 3 0 V 6 sightly undersized especially since the truck is rated to haul up to 5 000 lbs can 146t help but wonder where they got that number Ford must have known that because newer models come with the 4 0 a 50 HP boost as standard equipment Although the smaller engine is adequate for most needs and probably does better at the pumps Gas mileage is in the 16 17 range not not_exactly outstanding Real Truck people know who 146s got it in the compact class most would agree 147nobody but nobody 148 can touch Ford 146s Ranger Although the Japanese may have an advantage in car sales they remain on the outside looking in when it comes to trucks GM has never been a serious contender with thes 10 and Dodge is only starting to make some inroads with the Dakota Quite simply none match the build quality Ford puts into the Ranger For instance I drove my last Ranger a 1989 2WD for 13 years before recently upgrading to a slightly used 2001 4X4 Supercab Edge During my ownership covering 110 000 miles I replaced one set of brakes and shocks did one tune up replaced a leaky valve cover gasket several mufflers two batteries and a water pump Basically just routine maintenance quite a record for any vehicle especially one that cost just 9 000 For those of you that may not not_know not_the not_Edge not_series not_comes not_with not_fewer not_goodies not_than not_the not_top not_of not_the not_line not_XLT
Pos,It has a lot of power and rides very smooth We also needed it to pull a car trailer for our antique and classic car collection At first I was intimidated by this monster of a truck being a small woman But once you get used to it I think anyone would enjoy driving this truck We live on a farm and purchased a big truck in order to pull a horse trailer to transport our horses cows and or sheep as well as haul feed for them I buy a ton at a time It handles very nice and makes you sit up so tall you cant not_help but to feel powerful Ours has a v 10 in it and I wouldnt not_want not_anything not_less not_I not_really not_like not_the not_power
Pos,All controls were perfectly situated for an easy ride The F 150 was the most comfortable and economically sized When we decided to test drive the ride was smooth and quiet That was when we decided that the F 150 was what we wanted Since then I have been more than happy with our purchase We recently purchased a new Ford F 150 Super Crew for the reason that we wanted a truck We looked at the Dodge Ram the Dodge Dakota and the Ford Ranger We have taken it with us on long road trips and even had to sleep in it which made for an accurate night of sleep I was impressed with the comfort I felt that the F 150 had made during the long drive I highly recommend this truck

Pos,So we ended up with a 1993 4x4 Pickup with A C and cruise control It drives very nicely amp isnt not_all not_that not_bad not_on not_the not_gas not_mileage It has bucket seats with a little bench type seat between them so that our daughter can sit in the middle We went to a dealership where a friend worked so we knew that we wouldnt not_be not_taken not_for not_a not_ride It had 35 K miles on it when we got it in 1996 amp it has been great to us We havent had to use the 4x4 feature that often but when we have it has met or exceeded our expectations all the time And we looked and looked wanting an extended cab 4x4 pickup with Air conditioning But in our price range the extended cab was out of the question amp hard to find We havent put that many miles on the truck in the 4 years we have had it since it is our second vehicle but we hope that will help preserve the value of the vehicle One thing I really like about the 1993 model is that the body style is so similar to the current style that many times people think our truck is New Kind of nice that Ford hasnt changed the body style much over the last few years
Pos,It just depends on your needs preferences My 93 Ford Ranger is a great truck to own As far as towing and hauling this truck actually rides better when its loaded down If you do want the extra power at the expense of a little gas mileage go for the V6 model rather than the 4 cylinder Although hard core off roaders might prefer the 4WD model unless you live in the outback the 2WD is much more practical and economical The engine is a large straight 4 cylinder with decent power and it shows no signs of needing any repairs any time soon It has over 90 000 miles on it is running great and has had no major repairs or service done on it other than regularly scheduled tune ups and replacing the tires My only complaints are 1 It could use a little more power for the big hills I live in a mountainous area so it would be nice to still be able to accelerate up those steep hills rather than just maintaining my speed but like I said it has decent power 2 I wouldnt not_mind not_a not_little not_more not_passenger not_space not_at not_the not_expense not_of not_a not_little not_cargo not_room but then again im 6 7 so it should be fine for most people It has had no problems towing small camping trailers or being heavily loaded with items like pianos and couches when I helped my uncle and aunt move and so its a very practical truck to have Plus its not not_as not_large not_and not_unwieldy as most other pickups that are a pain to park or that you would worry a lot about in underground parking I enjoy driving it but I try to keep too many people from finding out that I own it or I end up having to help people move all the time I guess that just comes with the territory in owning a pickup truck
Pos,No doubt from that blistering acceleration This never was a beautiful truck I 146ve had my 14686 Ranger since 1996 It was originally dark brown with a tan interior But now the rust has given it a two tone color scheme So at the next exit I tweaked it again Harder On really bad days I just knock off early The windshield wipers don 146t like to be too cold It keeps those plastic bins from sliding around as much But the wind noise is gone I like the bench seat The rear view mirror sought new employment one day out of the blue It wouldn 146t take much so I hope they 146re gentle That tightened the door to the point that it 146s difficult to open This truck was more than sufficient The dash holds note pads gloves and assorted ends well So at the next rest area I stopped and tweaked the door a bit It wasn 146t quite enough It really is comfortable Compared to the seats in my sales car 2000 Taurus it is very comfortable It came groveling back from under the seat and now sits close to the end gate pivot in the garage The first time was because it was worn out The second time because a damaged flywheel was actually the culprit the first time The radiator or a hose has developed a small leak I 146 m hoping it 146s a hose or clamps myself I bought it for 700 and consider it a great investment I 146 m a contractor on the side a salesman full time That 146s why I 146d like to go to a van when this truck gives up the ghost It also doesn 146t always want to stay closed The mechanic who does the work on my car quoted me about 750 I hate paying retail It 146s also a bit more comfortable than the metal when crawling up to reach the bin with the power tools So I dropped the transmission with someone who knew what they were doing and replaced the clutch for about 300 The glove box is the tip out variety and doesn 146t hold much They keep the tools out of sight and small parts easy to find I 146ve tested the payload capacity a few times too many The decision is of course up to you The only body panel that has not not_been not_eaten not_away not_at not_least not_partially not_by not_rust is the hood All the wheel wells are slowly expanding Why pay someone else money I made Let 146s see buy new truck and throw money away I do electrical plumbing dry walling tile work and more This truck does it well When I was an employee we had most everything delivered The view out the back is limited by stuff in the topper anyway I 146ve quite a lot of tools neatly boxed in those cheap plastic 50 gallon bins No threading on the lever or in the knob so I wrapped electrical tape around the lever and pounded the knob onto it No problem Now if you need more cargo room more tonnage towing power I 146d certainly get something else Then occasionally the blower shreds them fine enough that they blow out but normally I need to dig them out I gave up and tore the vent louvers off the dash The bed has taken a great deal of abuse but looks pretty good I found a bed mat in a garage I was working on one time that a previous owner had left If you want a good solid truck to occasionally take a new bed home for yourself or your neighbors then this truck is plenty You won 146t catch too many new truck owners hauling dirt or garden manure in their new truck I 146ve no qualms This truck has been great for all of it Tax deduction I 146ve two great tax deductions I get to tuck into bed at night when I 146 m not not_out not_on not_a not_job not_late At least it looks like it Not very well fitted either Heck for 700 you think you 146d get something a bit better eh The shifter knob for the five speed transmission has fallen off a few times The windshield is cracked from a large extension ladder being strapped to the roof of the truck I just laid it over the top of the topper and roof of the truck and strapped it down in the front and back You could almost scald tender skin on the hottest setting I 146 m not not_certain not_what not_tender not_skin not_you not_146re not_thinking not_of not_133 not_No not_A not_C but I grew up without A C and am generally fine without it when dressed in grubby clothes Many items on this truck seem ready to jump ship I 146 m not not_certain not_why not_Electrical not_tape not_fixes not_many not_things not_not not_as not_well not_as not_duct not_tape but I 146 m more of an electrician not not_a not_heating not_air not_guy One of the first things I had to do was have the exhaust system replaced 300 for the whole thing Another 200 for a topper I was ready to go to work and not not_letting not_the not_entire not_neighborhood not_when not_I not_came not_went Now the leaves just blow whole out of the chute while I 146 m driving down the road Just wait until this winter when the heater really gets going Picture flaming leaves 133 Anyway the vent louvers have joined the collection on the shelf in the garage It hangs down over the window but doesn 146t obstruct the view Since the seat doesn 146t have whiplash protection the first aid kit has a dual use Perhaps someone will encourage me to purchase a newer vehicle someday by rear ending this truck The tires have been the only suspension on the rear at least a couple of times once with a too large load of shingles and the second with a way too heavy tree trunk A couple of other times since then I 146ve had the rear bumper drag on the way out the driveway On the longer trips it doesn 146t limit you with bolsters or even attempt to cradle you It just supports you and does this job very well I keep my cordless drill Sawsall in the space behind the seat I 146ve also mounted a first aid kit behind my head over the seat You can 146t work on a roof or in an attic when it 146s that hot anyway and if you 146re in an A C controlled house or a basement then you 146re golden 150 so to speak anyway working in the dark I get rather pasty I think the carpeting is after market The second time I opted for the biggest starter that would fit in there Teamed with an oversized battery what 146s 147reluctant 148 for me may be 147 not not_at not_all not_148 not_for not_someone not_else not_I not_don not_146t know I 146ve also noted a lot of leaves end up in my vents The blowers also contribute an odd leaf or two There 146s a nice bin above the glove that is at least as big as the glove box itself and that is great for the smaller things I don 146t need in my pouches but need to have along Three cans of stop leak and it slowed down a bit more Reflecting upon that it 146s probably the water pump I notice this leak better in the winter as when the water mix gets too low in the radiator it doesn 146t reach the heater core and the cabin blower blows cold air Otherwise the heater works great One of the first rules of business is to keep expenses down and profits up Sales have been slower lately but are building up again I stay busy doing jobs smaller than most guys take on but no matter the economy I cringe at the thought of covering a new truck payment every month It caused a bit of stress on the roof and some cracks developed Iowa doesn 146t have laws concerning cracked windshields so I 146ll let it go until it becomes a problem I carry the ladder very rarely as it looks like a hook ladder truck coming down the road Well perhaps more like a tight contractor who won 146t spring for a ladder rack It doesn 146t take as much as it used to to do that The right front brake hangs up once in a while I believe I need new calipers but don 146t feel like dropping the money into the truck and don 146t have the time to spare anyway I just avoid using the parking brake and things work fine If the day is under freezing they need some time for the engine to warm them up a bit Not a huge deal Most old trucks have a quirk or two this one just has a dozen or so A more annoying thing is that when the humidity is high or especially if there 146s been heavy dew the truck is very reluctant to start I 146ve replaced the starter twice The only issue I 146ve had with the interior noise level 150 it 146s tolerable even at Interstate speeds 150 was on that trip to Chicago I turn the radio up to cover the engine noise Even though I say it is tolerable that doesn 146t mean you can hold conversation with a passenger I 146d also noted a great deal of wind noise from the passenger door and could see daylight through the top seal This may be related to the leaf thing but when it rains I 146ve noticed that the floor on the passenger 146s side is wet I just make certain anything that I put on the floor isn 146t going to be damaged by moisture copper fittings small bins of screws I 146ve had a couple of cardboard boxes disintegrate with a couple of pounds of screws in them before I began to watch what I keep there Now that I work on my own I 146ve learned that I personally need something that can carry a bit more A ton or one ton van would be right Would I recommend this to you I guess you need to evaluate what you 146re going to use it for and what you 146re willing to put up with I 146 m out to impress exactly no one Then I 146d also rather spend some time with my tax deductions girl in 1998 and boy in 2001 rather than running ragged all the time I 146ve got about 130 000 miles on this little critter and figure I 146ll drive it until it falls apart around me One day I 146ll close the door and the thing will disintegrate into a cloud of dust I 146ll rummage through it and pick out my tools I do believe the next work truck will be a van though But off topic The right pivot point for the end gate has fallen off I found it and have it on a shelf in the garage Believe it or not not_I not_146d rather drive this than a new truck I never worry about door dings in the parking lot at Lowe 146s Menard 146s Home Depot I cut shingles on the hood and use the side panels to knock concrete out of my mixing trough Why Because I can it 146s convenient Nothing I do to this truck will reduce its value at all because it is far from the showroom Nor has this truck ever been considered powerful On harder bumps it will fall open and try to steal items from the bin above it It takes two or more tries to get it to stay closed again Even while closed it looks like it 146s threatening to open A cautionary glance stops it but it seems to be muttering to itself even as it stays closed Insurance and licensing are almost silly 50 per year for registration 240 per year for decent insurance coverage Again one of the first rules of business is to keep expenses down and profits up The 2 3L engine is sufficient to keep it moving with traffic but not not_to not_pull not_anything not_large not_and not_continue not_to not_do not_so not_I not_146ve not_driven not_from not_Des not_Moines not_to not_Chicago not_with not_it not_to not_do not_a not_basement not_finish not_for not_my not_brother not_in not_law and even in Chicago traffic I was able to hold my own I 146 m never 147 chosen 148 at stop lights but people give me room when I signal I 146 m changing lanes I think other drivers see the rust and are afraid that if they get too close it 146ll jump onto their car too A POX ON YE Fine Once when I rented a lift and was backing it into position up a driveway the clutch began smoking A lot It 150 the clutch not not_the not_smoke lasted another year or so until I could barely make it up my own driveway
Pos,Its got about six feet of bedroom that will allow you to flag any oversized loads comfortably without expecting a pork wagon to pull you over My 93 Ford Mustang finally gave up the ghost at the most inopportune time right before my Spring Break trip to Paris Not about to lose the second trip of a lifetime see my review of Belfast for the first I scoped the Eiffel Tower before coming back and dealing with reality Fortunately my Ford dealer pulled a mess of strings and ta da I was driving home from Houston another long story in my new 2000 Ford Ranger As I said it also handles well enough but dont not_get not_happy not_and not_make not_any not_fancy not_moves not_out not_there or you ll be picking junk up off the road as a result Inside the cab is a foldaway armrest which acts as an extra stash for CDs your tape player guns or whatever Its a nice place to prop your elbow when alone and will gladly make room for your Special Someone to cuddle up Of course you ll run your usual gamut of Ford anagram for Fix or Repair Daily putdowns but the Mustang yep even the recently deceased has always been an old reliable for me and there was just something about the Ranger that made me want to go for it I wouldnt not_open not_a not_hauling not_company not_with not_one but other than that this baby will tote whatever you like down the highway without the excessive fishtailing you see in similar economy pickups The cushy seats also pull back enough to take advantage of what you will find to be an unreal amount of space Hey I fit my briefcase a full semester of textbooks a crowbar a six pack of hard lemonade baseball caps and dozens of assorted papers back there so you couldnt even see it I dont not_know not_if not_those not_seats not_are not_gonna not_take not_that not_kind not_of not_abuse not_in not_2006 but I wont bet against it The vinyl steering wheel is starting to wear a bit but the upholstery is standing up well and the seats look like they re ready to go quite a few rounds It comes with a cool speaker system and for a few bucks your car stereo dealer should be able to hook up something that ll make your cab come alive Also its got a hideaway spare and jack that hasnt seen the light of day CAUTION this baby came with squeaky Firestone radials that havent popped yet but im planning to swap them someday real soon and so should you All in all this is a good looking dependable little ride that will haul your stuff around smoothly for some time to come Keep your oil changed regularly drop a few bucks for upholstery cleaning once in a while and the Ranger will reward you with reliable performance and low maintenance that you will long appreciate
Pos,It rides just fine with a load of lumber but is a bit bouncy as they all are on poor roads My truck also is helpful on trips from the nursery with loads of mulch lots of plants or moving a few appliances for neighbors The only option I added was a tarp cover that fits over the bed and rests on 4 arched aluminum rails to allow rain to run off The seating room is better then my old 87 chevy C10 PU I sold a few years ago I am overweight and felt that I might have to get one with a supercab but the regular cab fits me just fine im semi retired and about to retire shortly so I wanted to find a vehicle that would serve my needs I decided to buy my 2000 Ford Ranger XLT LWB after I looked at the competition My desire was to get a truck to haul lumber home for special projects the LWB is 7 long carry my big RC model airplanes to from the field drive something that was economical to run my 2 5 ltr 4 cyl w automatic amp overdrive gets 24 MPG This is Not a truck to pull a big boat or trailer nor does it have the HP or torque to carry big loads like a full size truck but it works just fine Like any pickup caution must be used when driving in snow ice I looked at trucks from all the manufacturers and had 2 basic needs good milage and something I would enjoy driving I found both in this truck and recommend it to any one going on a fixed income and yet wants to have a certain amount of flexability in their vehicle
Pos,It is so nice Very roomy no back seat It handles good in the rain or snow It has never given him any problems It has nice pick up and is pretty fast When he pulled up in his green truck I fell in love It has a nice sized bed and is perfect for those people who do not not_need not_a not_full not_sized not_car not_or not_a not_huge not_truck This is a perfect truck for teens and people without families or people with one child I said that this truck is very roomy even in back because there is no option that says My boyfriend owns a 1992 Ford Ranger and he loves it He generally has bad luck with cars and after his second car a mustang broke down he decided it was time for a new car I begged him to purchase a truck because I think they are great
Pos,I bought my 92 Ranger back in Dec of 91 right off the showroom floor This truck is a great first truck and is also great for people who need a truck that gets great gas mileage As I stated earlier the truck was cobalt blue heres the rest of the info XLT 2 wheel drive 5 speed manual transmission 4 cylinder standard sound system It was small enough that it was able to get 28 MPG on the highway and wasnt not_a not_nightmare not_to not_park not_while not_still not_being not_big not_enough not_to not_haul not_around not_things not_like not_queen not_size not_mattresses not_with not_no not_problem All said and done it cost me 9500 2 9 financing over 5 years I had this truck until 1999 when I upgraded to an F 250 During that time I had only one thing that went wrong My one complaint about the Ranger and Ford trucks in general is the location of the spare I had a flat once and I had to drag myself under the truck to get the spare off it should be a bit easier than that The cellenoid sp freaked out twice and I had to jump the posts to get the truck to turn over I also had two factory recalls Recall 1 A bad seal in the drivers door that might cause the door to open suddenly if water seeped in and froze Recall 2 A faulty oil pump I loved this truck It was just a bit above factory standard amp cobalt blue my fav color I was on leave from my Air Force technical training course and was about to be shipped off to Offutt AFB I needed a truck that could handle a 500 mile trip without breaking this little airmans wallet 04 25 00 Heres some requested information about the engine 2 3 liter 100 h p 4 cylinder
Pos,Every family needs a truck at one point or another My family has personally retired four trucks in the last 8 years In my Ranger I have all the securities I am looking for It has duel air bags with a shut off switch for the passengers side Adjustable shoulder belts allow anyone to wear the seat belt comfortably Anti Lock Breaks allow me to drive the California Freeways without fear Reasonable price and easy on the insurance the Ford Ranger is the best small truck on the market When shopping we look for something that gets good gas mileage requires low maintenance and is comfortable to ride in We ve had a Chevy a Dodge and a GMC but once we got our first Ford we found out what driving a truck is all about The Ranger has a good size bed for hauling a strong enough motor to tow just about anything and all the amenities you get from a car Rangers with the extra cab and jump seats are especially nice for families with young children Part and repair on the Ranger are very reasonable not not_that not_I not_have not_had not_to not_repair not_anything not_My not_truck not_gets not_about not_22 not_miles not_to not_the not_gallon not_which not_is not_good not_for not_a not_truck not_Being not_a not_woman not_I not_am not_always not_looking not_for not_a not_reliable not_car not_I not_dont not_want not_to not_deal not_with not_repair not_work not_I not_want not_to not_feel not_protected not_even not_in not_a not_small not_truck not_I not_want not_to not_know not_that not_I not_wont not_break not_down not_in not_the not_middle not_of not_no not_where not_at not_night

Pos,The 2000 Ranger handles very well on the road I purchased this fully loaded 2000 Ford Ranger for my wife The truck is the four door 4X4 off road model with every option available We have a cabin near Yellowstone and the Ranger manages the unplowed roads 10 14 inches with ease We couldnt believe that our 97 model was without cupholders Ford corrected the problem in the 2000 model It makes the extended cab both useful and convenient Ford also introduced a combination cassette cd stereo this year which has great sound The sticker price was 25 000 I purchased this truck to replace our 1997 Ford Ranger Without a doubt the 4 door option is the greatest improvement We love the flare sides on our sport model and really appreciated the automatic transmission and 4 wheel drive on the fly All of the options are expensive but it is a great looking sporty truck to drive It has tow hooks in front and back which make it easy for us to help friends without 4X4s when they take on more than their truck or car can handle I would not not_recommend not_that not_the not_off not_road not_package not_be not_purchased not_unless not_the not_buyer not_really not_had not_off not_road not_use

Pos,The seats are real firm but comfortable The steering is tight and there is minimal body lean My sport has the pioneer 290 watt 6 Disc changer with Subwoofer Man this stereo sounds great The power is very good My 93 had pretty good power of the line but was a dog on the highway My 02 is another story My 02 has 204 hp versus 160 hp and you can really feel the difference on the highway and the off the line power is real good too The interior looks great too with high quality Mine has the overhead console too with compass and outside temperature with i find pretty useful although i did not not_think not_i not_would not_initially The exterior styling is totally awesome the best looking Suv out there I get between 16 and 20 miles per gallon which i think is acceptable for a Suv So i can say that i am really happy with my 02 sport I bought my sport in July of 2002 and have not not_had not_any not_problems not_with not_it not_I not_am not_really not_happy not_with not_the not_way not_it not_handles not_I not_used not_to not_have not_a not_93 not_explorer not_sport and the 93 handled like a dump truck compared to my 02
Pos,The seats do pop out fairly easily If you have the choice by the extended version We also have a van that makes a very funny whiny noise We didnt not_know not_what not_we not_would not_end not_up not_with not_since not_we not_were not_shopping not_used When we found the Windstar we ended up buying we were pleased It makes it much easier for the passengers in the rear bench seat to get into his seat We knew when purchasing this van that there is NO TRUNK space it has a lot more than the Dodge Caravan however We had a 1992 Ford Aerostar and really liked it But when the transmission started to go we decided to shop for a new to us van But while they can be done by only one person it is better suited to two people doing it We have had problems with the LOCKS We had to sacrifice on a couple of features we wanted but it had better safety ratings than the Dodge Caravan which were everywhere on the used car lots It is nice and roomy for our four boys and all the seats are quite comfortable I would definitely buy a Windstar again and do recommend it highly after all all vehicles have minor quirks As it turns out it wasnt a real sacrifice as the front drivers seat slides forward in such a way that a child can easily get into his seat and the driver slides the seat back into place easily We have keyless remote entry Sometimes either the sliding door or the trunk lock will not not_unlock not_that not_way not_Thankfully not_we not_did not_discover not_that not_we not_can not_disarm not_the not_alarm not_and not_then not_use not_the not_key not_to not_unlock not_the not_stuck not_lock We sacrificed on the dual sliding door when we were shopping we were close to having 4 children 6 and under and we wanted the ease of it But reading safety reviews we realized that while giving up on convenience we were gaining in safety We ve grown used to it and it doesnt affect how it drives but it is a bit annoying We ve had our van described as a rocket van due to the noise I really like that carseat tether straps attach directly to a metal piece on the seat rather than the floor It is difficult to fit a stroller in the back one of our double strollers is too big and wont fit We had been spoiled by having the Aerostar extended so this has been an adjustment I actually damaged the window tinting film by trying to cram a larger item into the too small trunk One thing we were not not_happy not_to not_give not_up was the heat air controls to the rear of the van Thankfully we live in a very mild area with few temperature extremes so the boys dont not_get not_too not_hot not_or not_too not_cold not_Our not_gas not_mileage not_has not_been not_much not_better not_with not_this not_van not_than not_with not_the not_heavier not_Aerostar not_I not_also not_like not_how not_it not_handles not_like not_a not_car
Pos,It was unbelievable We own a 1998 Windstar So I guess it is fairly roomy back there We have put 60 000 miles on our Windstar in 2 years We plan on buying another Windstar when we do buy again At that point I was sold on driving a Windstar for the rest of my life We travel an awful lot We have had ONE malfunction with the vehicle Our transmission went In addition my husbands brother a 6 3 basketball player has accompanied us on road trips and he prefers the back bench We were going 30 he was probably going 15 20 We were thrown off the road and I was 4 months pregnant Very scary The drivers seat and all passenger seat areas on that side were not not_affected not_AT not_ALL not_I not_was not_very not_impressed not_and not_relieved not_Neither not_of not_us not_had not_any not_physical not_injuries not_or not_problems We and everyone else who rides in it is completely impressed by how well it handles and how smooth the ride is I really love this car We got the basic model with very few extras Still it is a great car for the money I didnt not_realize not_what not_an not_awesome not_vehicle not_it not_was not_until not_we not_were not_in not_a not_car not_accident not_Another not_vehicle not_pulled not_into not_the not_drivers not_side not_of not_our not_vehicle However the Windstar shut off when we were hit so we avoided a huge pine tree in front of us Also from the looks of the inside of the vehicle I though no damage had been done I calmed myself down then got out and saw that the entire drivers side of the van looked like it had been bent in half That is the only complaint I have about this vehicle I am not not_sure not_if not_it not_went not_because not_of not_how not_much not_we not_use not_it not_or not_not not_We not_have not_a not_theory not_that not_it not_could not_be not_related not_to not_the not_accident not_we not_were not_in not_As not_a not_side not_note not_we not_were not_told not_that not_is not_a not_good not_idea not_to not_have not_the not_transmission not_serviced not_sooner not_than not_the not_owners not_manual not_suggests not_I not_love not_the not_way not_the not_vehicle not_is not_laid not_out not_I not_like not_the not_cup not_holders not_the not_little not_compartments not_and not_the not_handle not_to not_help not_you not_get not_in not_and not_out not_Also not_there not_are not_tether not_strap not_holders not_for not_car not_seats not_on not_every not_possible not_location not_standard not_in not_the not_Windstar
Pos,The drive Oh those pesky AXOD transmissions Thats correct one under the front passenger seat We average about 17 mpg in the city and 23 highway At highway speeds some tire noise is heard but it is not not_very not_loud The seat will slide up against the steering wheel allowing easy access through the doorway We have not not_had not_any not_problems not_with not_the not_A not_C not_even not_living not_in not_muggy not_Hawaii The driver door is longer than other model years and the driver seat is positioned on rails With the 1998 model only Ford delayed jumping on the driver side sliding door addition in a very interesting way It was during this visit that the dealership noted for us the transmission hesitation and scheduled us for a second visit As the mother of two small kids my husband and I can position ourselves on each side of the van to load kids The only option lacking from the step up is the power driver seat which may be more hassle than it is worth The 20 gallon tank keeps me from living at the local supply hut gas station but it does hurt when refueling On newer models The power rear quarter windows are great for airing the van out and the power side view mirrors make an easy task of adjusting for individual driver tastes When we first married my husband and I thought there wasnt not_any not_need not_for not_one not_of not_those not_staid not_family not_vehicles not_the not_90s not_equivalent not_of not_the not_station not_wagon We recently had to have the transmission rebuilt under warranty thank you Ford and it was a little soon in the life of any vehicle at 35 000 miles When I first saw this option I wondered what idiot thought of this I didnt not_see not_a not_need not_for not_entry not_on not_that not_side not_not not_with not_a not_5 not_ft not_entryway not_on not_the not_other not_Ahh not_motherhood The van cant not_corner not_on not_rails and I wouldnt not_recommend not_trying not_it but it does have a comfortable ride Small bumps in the road are hidden the steering wheel has a solid feel to it and very little road noise intrudes into the cabin area The van also cranks out some heat enough to have to lower the settings after only a few minutes Did I mention we used to live outside Seattle hmm Minivans overall tout seating for seven with Ford not not_being not_an not_exception The base Windstar GL is a no frills van with the 3 0 L engine producing 150 hp Not enough for someone trading in a Ford Mustang 5 0 so we decided that at the least we needed the optional 3 8 L V 6 which produces a more satisfying 200 hp Vroom Vroom The third bench folds down onto itself and rolls forward to touch the middle bench opening up the rear cargo area even more Ford had the correct intentions when installing tether strap anchors in the Windstar putting two on the middle bench and one on the front passenger seat The 1998 Windstar has a good list of standard options ABS brakes dual front airbags nicer cloth seats than some other auto makers Plymouth comes to mind power steering and brakes height adjustable seatbelts for front passengers tilt wheel and cruise control which has controls set into the steering wheel itself This can be operated by the controls on the dash or the controls set into the pillar behind the driver the pillar in guy speak Air flows into the cavernous rear area from a vent on the same pillar and from four other vents two above the middle seat and two above the third seat We have found that two adults can sit comfortably in the third seat with a child but three adults in that seat are a tight fit The seats themselves are very comfortable on long trips but you pay for that feel when lugging them out For smaller people this could be a two person task This puzzles me even more when I note that they neglected to put even one on the third row bench Most buyers in the market for a larger vehicle have come to expect that you pay for the safety and roominess at the gas pump Again Ford is right there in the pack with all the other auto makers The 3 8L engine also provides very sufficient power for highway merging and passing and is fairly fast off the start line ok my nickname used to be Mrs Andretti Match this with the 4 speed transmission and we are ready to roll Literally Since we knew that we would spend part of the ownership time in warmer climates we sought a van with the rear air option The space left open behind this seat is large by any means I can stand hunched over adjusting my daughters car seat and I am 6 ft tall While I envy the driver side door since it would be a much easier option I know I would lose the convenient cupholder recessed bin and rear A C control access that my 4 year old has right there It didnt not_take not_long not_two

offers a 26 gallon tank but that could just be delaying the inevitable Our van of choice was a great find at a Washington dealer For 16 000 we ended up with exactly what we were looking for We have many options available with the LX such as the roof rack aforementioned rear air privacy glass Premium Sound system more speakers basically power locks and windows and headrests for every seating position except the third bench middle seat The service department at the local Ford dealer was very helpful as dealerships go When it was determined that necessary parts had to be ordered from the mainland the dealership paid for a 3 week car rental my choice Ford Explorer heehee All of this was covered under warranty so our only out of pocket costs so far have been for oil changes Anyone in the market for a used minivan looking for the safest used van available Well you just found it Ford is reputed to have known of problems with certain transmissions linked to certain engine sizes but

Pos,The van is relatively quite and is most responsive during acceleration and de acceleration This sounds like a lot of work but all was replace under warranty by my excellent Ford dealer and the vehicle is performing well I really like the excellent ride probably due in part to the larger 121 inch wheelbase I purchased my new Windstar on January 9 1998 and have driven it some 36 350 miles I keep complete computer records on mileage maintenance and repairs and would like to report that I have averaged 23 07 mpg during this time with a low mileage of 17 65 and high mileage of 27 25 mpg while always using regular unleaded fuel in this V 6 3 8L engine About one third of my driving is on interstates and the balance is short trips I view the Windstar as reliable but the following items had to be addressed to wit 1 replaced both headlight assemblies due to moisture invasion 2 replaced the transmission field sensor 3 repaired the transmission due to a faulty mid range part 4 replaced a cruise control assembly 5 replaced a defective driver side door window activator and 6 re calibrate the computer
Pos,This is very frustrating This area obviously isnt not_sealed The Windstar is a decent sized minivan This is the only safety factor with this vehicle The Windstar is a nice riding vehicle with great driveability The driver side and passenger side front doors are too large The seats are very comfortable for long trips and the dash is laid out perfectly The brakes have performed flawlessly and still do not not_require not_replacement not_at not_the not_60 not_K not_mile not_mark The engine and transmission have performed flawlessly and are very smooth though shifts can be mushy at times We 146ve had our 98 Windstar since it was new and give it an overall excellent to superb rating PROS Other than the things mentioned this vehicle has been very reliable and a pleasure to drive It will usually quit within the first mile or two but Ford needs to find a permanent fix for this problem For some reason each of the four Ford cars and vans I have owned have had problems with excessive battery corrosion The door ajar sensing switches are prone to failure causing the light and audible alarm to continue to annoy you until you exceed 15 MPH The batteries usually last two years at the most My GMC pick up has seven years on a four year battery and is still starting fine RECOMMENDATIONS If you want a 98 Windstar look for the following options and or problems 1 Get rear air conditioning even if you live in a cool climate It 146ll add to the resale value and the additional air ducting will help with heating for the rear passengers in the winter 2 Opt for the large engine It made rattling noises whenever a bump was hit I torqued it down and have had no problems since 4 Test drive the vehicle to see if it has the faulty door ajar sensors There is enough cargo space behind the back seat to load a couple hundred dollars worth of groceries Other minivans I looked at such as the Dodge Plymouth Caravan Japanese models and the Chevy Astro were lacking in this area You 146re better off turning off the over drive in town or the transmission may 147hunt 148 for the right gear I like how Ford put the over drive button on the gearshift making this very simple and easy CONS This is great when you need them but when you park on an upward incline they tend to slam shut at the most inopportune times I E on your legs or back when leaning in the vehicle Even worse your kids This van is probably heavier than it 146s counterparts which will affect gas mileage and performance but it 146s worth it for it 146s 5 star safety rating This vehicle feels very very solid Weather sealing is superb Road noise is not not_bad not_at not_all The 3 0 is what I have and it 146s very peppy but the 3 8 would provide nearly the same gas mileage with an increase of torque and horsepower 3 Check the front suspension for loose or damaged components I had a bolt loosen itself on the front stabilizing bar in the passenger side wheel well This same problem existed in the Aerostar You 146d think they could find a better system UPDATE I found that if you spray WD 40 or a similar light oil in the door latch this problem may go away Dirt seems to be the culprit since the door ajar switches part of the door latch Other brands of minivans also have their quirks and problems too which you 146ll find if you look at reviews for those I feel the Windstar is a very safe and reliable vehicle for the entire family and a good value UPDATE As of March 2003 the Windstar is still a reliable vehicle Some problems noted since writing my initial review are Drivers side window quit working and sliding door lock quit working These items should not not_have not_failed not_with not_70 not_000 not_miles not_on not_the not_vehicle not_Resale not_value has also dropped faster than I anticipated I would still recommend this vehicle though even with these flaws
Pos,It drives great and rides even better When I do buy another vehicle it will be the Windstar The safety ratings on this vehicle have highly impressed me and the ease of use has me sold I dont not_even not_own not_a not_minivan but I wish I did I have a two year old and a three month old and drive a small car That is one tough thing to do My father recently purchased a Windstar and I fell in love with it I love the fact that there are climate controls in the front and back the doors can be locked from the tailgate the seats adjust nicely and the windows can be rolled up after the ignition is turned off I think my favorite feature about this minivan is that the drivers seat can be moved forward to get to the back seat without having to go around to the other side I have borrowed my dads Windstar many times and this really comes in handy
Pos,The price is right too for this nice mini van It has the ABS brakes front and passenger side airbag And the style is a wonderful atribution to the Ford Family The seats and everything are nice inside and looks and feels great After being in a horrible accident with the 5 of us in the van I decided to look only for a mini van with the highest crash test ratings for safety That is the only way for my family Ford Windstar rated the best among all the mini vans on the market today I love my Windstar Its nice looking and very safe for my family And the drop down motor in the case of a front crash to keep the motor from coming in on the driver and front passenger Keyless entry and for those of us with our hands full and unable to use the key to unlock the doors this is a great feature that I definately wanted and needed and its a wonderful thing to have
Pos,What really surprised us is the mileage We have driven it to Florida twice now and it beat our Honda Accord hands down and was so much more comfortable We will always by one just keep trading it up for a new one I test drove them all and will never turn from the Windstar again The turning ratio is not not_as not_good as some we drove but the roominess and the comfort is fantastic and a better trade I am overweight and everything fits me which is another bonus We were expecting our fourth child and knew that riding in two cars was just not not_economical not_or not_expectable I always have wanted a mini van and to be honest never considered a Ford till shopping around YES the sales people did make a difference but what really did it for us was that we could get WHAT we wanted for the price we wanted without upgrading it and getting every little add on We chose the one we did because of the room the simplicity little computer components which to us means lower repair bills
Pos,The back seat folds down fairly easily and there is tons of space behind the back seat to store a stroller and groceries I havent had any problems with my Windstar so far but I highly recommend it I was very skeptical about buying a mini van Once I test drove the Ford Windstar 1998 model I knew it was the mini van for me I bought the Windstar because of the price and because of the five star safety test I have three kids so I need lots of room for soccer balls book bags and other things boys collect I would have to say that Windstar has tons of room on the inside
Pos,One of mine broke already The cupholders for the front are not not_too not_sturdy The sensors for the sliding door are very sensitive They give false readings that the door is not not_closed not_all not_the not_way The only thing I didnt not_really not_like is the front end design The grille work and lights make the van look unhappy Look at it and you ll see With the facelift the 00 received and the addition of another sliding door the Windstar has just gotten better Recommendations Definitely get the V6 you will need the power Two minor annoyances Right now I am a year and a half into my second Windstar and couldnt be happier with it I leased a 95 Windstar and returned it after the lease was up I would have loved to have purchased it but financially it just wouldnt not_work not_Because not_of not_the not_good not_luck not_I not_had not_with not_the not_95 not_when not_I not_was not_in not_the not_market not_in not_98 not_I not_bought not_another not_Windstar not_Even not_with not_all not_the not_hype not_surrounding not_the not_redesigned not_Dodge not_I not_felt not_the not_Windstar not_was not_still not_the not_only not_minivan not_that not_didnt not_drive not_like not_a not_truck not_The not_Windstar not_felt not_and not_handled not_like not_a not_larger not_car
Pos,It was a GO This advantage has a price And offered me a free rental car This is a negligible nuisance i The light green car sold itself OPERATING The transmission gear changes are barely perceptible He blinked then took the keys My preliminary inquiries about the car and possible warranty issues It was a Ford EXPLORER With TWO Wheel Drive The transitions to and from OVERDRIVE are detectable only on the Tachometer They offered reasonable pricing fuel economy needed few options and were readily recognizable And so we were ready to be converted back or domesticated THE PURCHASE We have not not_tested not_the not_panic not_conditions not_for not_which not_the not_ABS not_system not_was not_designed Were simply brushed off with condescending comments no offers to FIX things In fact Ford HAS BECOME an import company having absorbed such as Jaguar and Volvo recently At road speeds the steering is VERY sensitive requiring very little input from the operator Why all that power For towing a ton and a half trailer with full passenger complement What about the repairs estimate Huh Those items were fixed on Warranty I fainted The system is very accurate requiring only a touch to set and to disable CAUTIONARY ADVISORY The mileage was only 16 400 Marilyn currently the breadwinner of the family did the road testing The overdrive control is within reach of an extended finger on the gear selection stalk Acceleration is startlingly effective One should get to know the 5 buttons by touch studying them on the road is foolishness It should not not_be not_necessary not_to not_mention but high quality workmanship should be evident everywhere in the vehicle The EXPLORER is also available with a V8 engine the operation of which must be pretty exciting i On the EXPLORER itself a door sticker advises a conflicting pressure of only 26 PSI No luck on color otherwise they had a 1998 that met her criteria Exceeded it in fact No more contusions on my poor pate Although the EXPLORER is a relatively complex vehicle it is easy to drive One should maintain high levels of attention to the task at hand Both hands that is Braking is steady and smooth The first impression when entering the EXPLORER is of the ample head room provided in the opening as well as the roof ceiling height My input was limited to avoiding 4 Wheel Drive Fully prepared we went off on a joyride one Friday and found our dream car Came the day of decision I took the Car over the hill Sierras to Sacramento CA where we had purchased our prize It is WHAT MADE US CONSIDER THIS VEHICLE From 1973 to 1999 we owned imports by BMW Audi VW and Toyota in that order After two years of planning we ventured into the car market For budgeting reasons the used car market was suitable for us and the search began My wife wrote the specifications Explicitly what she wanted had to be WHITE have FOUR doors less than FIVE years old have LOW mileage a reasonable PRICE and COMFORTable The parking brake WORKS an easy push of the foot will set it The controls for the Cruise control labeled Speed for some reason are located on the steering wheel It is incredible how much difference a Dealer can make With the recent models of their EXPLORER SUV the Ford Motor Company appears to have beaten the Import Market at its own game At night it is like being in an aircraft cockpit 14 Rear Center Console A C direction and vents Fan Speed Earphone outlet The service consulant appeared wrote up the 30 000 mile service 379 I added a 112 including labor set of mud flaps then he lent a very interested ear to my woes It is a complete success with us We have had it for eight months now and expect to keep it for 6 5 years The best place to be while enduring dentistry and car repairs is elsewhere and I went there for several hours I returned after several hours to find the Explorer still sitting in its stall The instruments and controls are clustered to allow the operator to run the machine without undue distraction from the road and traffic Crucial instruments are larger crucial controls including windshield visibility are within reach of an extended finger The SOHC V6 needs only the lightest touch on the pedal to take the EXPLORER from standing start to road speed I estimate that adequate performance in traffic requires only about 1 4 of pedal Of course it was a big service and I had added the mud flaps at the last second After another hour came the call 542 24 OK 379 plus 112 491 plus Sales Tax 50 Deductible on Warranty Seemed OK BULLETIN Our Explorer was nudging 30 000 miles during a difficult month for us a major service was needed but I was paralyzed with indecision about how the nearest FORD Dealer in Carson City NV would react Of course the aggressive driver is a threat to all A high performance vehicle like the EXPLORER is unforgiving of driver errors which can account for some of the highly publicized rollovers One must reach for others an effort that usually involves taking ones eyes off the road Driver information from the instrument set is abundant although some warning lights are so small that anxiety can replace knowledge He looked at all four items wrote them down I asked him to estimate the costs to me I was willing to come all the way back 224 mile round trip to accommodate their schedule We had some at first exacerbated by an indifferent dealer in Nevada 15 miles North of here Per the above all disappointments were remedied by a crackerjack dealer 112 miles West of here SATISFACTION So far each day has brought a new and happy surprise for us Ours is a 1998 2WD two wheel drive NOT a 2D two door Model SPORT which is otherwise similar but shorter FEATURES As in an aircraft cockpit an operator should know the instrument layout so well that a sweeping scan is all that is needed to ascertain that operations are normal Close scrutiny is advisable only when the vehicle is stopped Tire air pressure is problematic the recent spate of highly publicized accidents illustrate that In the Ford EXPLORER operators manual the recommendation is to inflate per instructions molded onto the tire itself 35 PSI on our present equipment These acquisitions came with new foreign expertise combined with the best of a century of manufacturing and merchandising in the USA With these assets Ford is producing new products that deliver what the buyer has become used to getting during the past 25 years The engine power is ample easily overcoming challenges from changes in terrain Although the center of gravity is higher the EXPLORER glides around curves Being a car on a truck chassis the ride becomes jouncy when passing over bumps and depressions in the pavement at slow speeds The same goes for the Steering Wheel tilt adjustment Simply stated DO NOT try to do this while the vehicle is in motion Handling is rewarding and crisp the EXPLORER has a very tight turning ratio making it one of the most nimble vehicles we have driven They delivered performance and at times lots of satisfaction but a graph would show how we fared monetarily outrageously costly maintenance says it all Our son cured of his addiction to Toyotas purchased a Camry replacement last year One of his best friends is an executive with FORD We were filled with misgivings for months I did not not_trust not_them not_Our not_laundry not_list not_had not_grown

sales executive who meant to soften the ride for some target buyer segment that dislike hard or bumpy rides or trucks in general The Explorer design came from the Ranger pickup chassis Anyone with experience with radial tires going flat will recollect how sloppy the handling becomes FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS ON THE TIRE YOU ARE INFLATING i DISAPPOINTMENTS What did Ford do Study the competition and note what the buyers like and try to do it better Rather than torment buyers with agonizing decisions about options that should be standard items Ford has created and delivers a standardized vehicle in three basic versions any one of which can overcome buyer resistance with an ample complement of attractive and useful features that make sense and are easy to use Since it is a relatively high performance design the EXPLORER is demanding on drivers who must learn to concentrate on the task of running this finely tuned machine All too often drivers seem to become intoxicated with the SUV concept and design and allow the vehicle to govern them An operator who is distracted by passengers usecured items items in the seating areas comfort and audio control settings and of course the infamous cell phones is out of control and is a hazard to persons and property A lack of attention can lead to an unpleasant emergency situation This is a high end model variation commonly referred to

Pos,I love my 1995 Ford Explorer with automatic transmission and four wheel drive The V6 engine is the perfect blend of power yet economy Also the tan interior shows dirt far worse than my previous vehicle with a gray interior The left turn signal seems a little glitchy often turning itself off before I get to the turn When it rains hard we have many flood sites here in San Antonio But I need not not_worry If that sedan in front of me can make it through the water ive got it made im Canyon Woman Queen of the Wild Frontier My friends Explorer does the same thing I had warranty work done to fix a problem with the column shift when Christopher was new The ability to fine tune the seat position makes a significant difference in driver and passenger comfort Air conditioner heater controls for back seat passengers greatly increase their comfort When I go shopping for small furniture I need not not_hire not_a not_mover not_im not_tough not_and not_able not_to not_carry not_my not_own not_purchase not_im well you know In case of deep snow well it COULD happen even here in South Texas im ready Rough terrain is my Christophers forte I love my power seat package and plan to buy the equivalent in any future vehicle The service was problem free After five years my only service expenses have been for routine maintenance I love to take my Explorer out on the road after a good wash and wax with tires gleaming and the radio blasting okay so I listen to talk radio and my hearings not not_as not_good as it used to be im Canyon Woman Queen of the Wild Frontier The extra wide cargo space is home to furry pups as well as bricks and garden supplies you name it My only error in choosing this vehicle was in the color The Mocha Frost okay TAN exterior looks exactly like 40 of the other Explorers on the road I often approach a look alike in the parking lot wondering why my clicker isnt not_working not_to not_unlock not_the not_door For one thing the ride is smoother than the ride of the average truck And I love the increased height of the vehicle My Honda Civic is a great little car but I feel like im dragging my butt on the ground in comparison In Christopher yes I name my cars the great explorer and protector I can survey the road from a dominant position Other drivers stay out of my way im Canyon Woman Queen of the Wild Frontier
Pos,You wont be disappointed Id highly recommend one to any one looking for versatility I wanted something that could haul anything anywhere and at anytime If you want a vehicle that will do many things besides get you there you should definitely consider a utility vehicle The seats are comfortable on long trips im not not_beat not_up not_nor not_fatigued not_when not_I not_get not_to not_my not_destination not_Its not_a not_nice not_compromise not_between not_a not_regular not_road not_car not_van not_amp not_pick not_up not_truck At the same time I wanted it to have a comfortable ride and good handling My Ford Explorer Limited has done all of this and more ive only had to do regular maintenance services If I were to knock it I wish it stood taller on the road Mine is a 1995 and has performed better than I expected I do wish utility vehicles got a little better gas mileage
Pos,This vehicle still looks new and drives just like new I have found that used Explorers are a good investment most of the time It seems that previous owners take pride in maintaining these vehicles in top condition I own a 1995 Explorer Eddie Bauer Edition The only problem I have encountered in 86 000 miles is when towing the gas mileage drops dramatically I have the V 6 should have had a V 8 But if you are looking for a good handling firm ride and towing abilities then consider a new or used Ford Explorer in the 4 door body style not not_the not_2 not_door not_Sport not_it not_is not_short and the ride is not not_as not_good It handles well and gives a firm ride which is what a sport utility vehicle is supposed to do If you are looking for a soft luxury ride dont not_buy not_a not_SUV not_buy not_a not_luxury not_car
Pos,Any road noise and diesel noise is deadened inside the truck The width and length of the crew cab makes the interior enormous It also doesnt use any more fuel than it normally would without the trailer The folks at Ford did a wonderful job of designing the interior of the cab He was in Chicago and he had just test drove a brand spanking new 2000 F350 dually He immediately fell in love with it It was a long bed 4x4 with a powerstroke diesel He then filled out the credit application and headed home then told me about his little adventure but thats another story In addition to being roomy it offers plenty of adjustable cup holders front and back seats extra power outlets and storage He got the call a couple of days later to come pick up his shiny new truck so he back off to Chicago The dealership even let him hook up his trailer for the test drive After much haggling he finally got the price down from 42 000 to 36 000 We have had 6 adults in the truck and there was still plenty of room to stretch out The crew cab was made for just that a crew Make sure you re ready for that before you purchase it But all around this is a well thought out powerful truck that still rides smooth and will last a very very long time The only thing I dont not_like not_about not_the not_truck is the fact that for in town use going to the grocery store and such the sheer size of it makes parking very difficult and it may catch a few curbs in town while going around corners The Powerstroke is reliable and the transmission behind it very strong Being in the construction business my husband knows many guys with different trucks and many of these guys have had their trucks in the shop several times getting work done on their Alison trannies Any down time on your truck in this business is a week without a paycheck so we appreciate the dependability of the Ford But there are times although few and far between that my husband isnt not_on not_the not_road and we use the truck to haul friends and family instead of a trailer Of course from the beginning I held a grudge and hated everything about this truck I was a 530 payment we didnt not_really not_need not_it not_was not_brand not_new and with the amount of miles he drives I just knew it was a bad investment to buy a new vehicle The seats are very comfortable and the design is ergonomic which is extremely important when you drive up to 16 hours a day to get across the country When Jeff bought the truck it had 52 miles on it Now a year later it has over 65 000 and over 50 000 of those miles have been pulling a trailer My husband Jeff is a contractor that travels all over the country Up until December of 1999 he did this in a very large very old very unsafe Ford passenger van I knew he had been looking around for a used vehicle to pull his 20 foot cargo trailer around the country with then one day I got a call from him We have not not_had not_any not_hint not_of not_trouble not_so not_far and have never done anything but regular maintenance and tire changes on it Of course regular maintenance is a bit more expensive than on my little Taurus which only takes 5 qts of oil but the longevity of the diesel will be worth it This truck is very practical for anyone that has many people to haul around for people that pull trailers or RVs or just desires a strong truck to do everyday chores such as pulling large stumps helping stranded motorists or hauling heavy loads And it was big Extremely big But Jeff convinced me that it was much safer for him than the old van and that the diesel engine would last a very long time Slowly but surely this truck that I had deemed so evil started to grow on me Of course it was hard to get used to driving this monster vehicle after driving my 1997 Ford Taurus for the past year and a half but I soon mastered it Soon I grew to love this truck more than my trusty taurus The Powerstroke Diesel is much quieter than the Cummins that Dodge and Chevy use and it has more power so when you re pulling a 20 foot trailer loaded down with shingles carpet and linoleum the truck doesnt lurch
Pos,Ford built into them Oh by the way it sounds great too The subwoofer is very powerful especially for an eight incher The silver faced guage cluster is awesome and easy to see This is due in part to the nice adjustments It behaved like it had a tough racing torsion bar suspension The stereo display is large and very easy to read At night the faces glow green and the numbers are black Not that cheap sugar icing either we re talking gourmet butter icing baby In case you didnt not_know not_not not_all not_Ford not_dealers not_sell not_SVT not_cars In dip and out For a front driver especially 61 39 weight distribution the handling is amazingly neutral Only specially authorized dealers get them and they are only allotted a certain number per year The compression ratio is also higher at 10 2 1 so you have to use premium fuel No problems for me in the SVT Even after extended periods in the car the seat feels completely natural The steering wheel and gear shifter are exactly where they should be in relation to the driver All controls are within easy reach and the leather wrapped wheel and shift knob are a dream to grab If you want to know how these work you can find the info at http www svt ford com It is concealed in a nicely finished ported box that sits on the driver side wall in the cargo area However sixth gear in the SVT is actually a useable gear All of them are very nicely and smoothly spaced There are also some pretty cool mods after the engine including the dual mass flywheel and one in two out shaft design of the gearbox You get a free one year membership to the SVT Owners Assoc and a free loaner car when yours is in for servicing Nice touch There is no pronounced over or understeer unless you really want it to be there Once again the driver is in command If you re into it there are also TONS of aftermarket performance parts available for the Focus Not that it needs it This takes up a little bit of your cargo room of course but hey did I buy an SVT to haul groceries and gear in huge quantities The car looks like its hauling a even when its parked I often find myself standing and staring at it after parking just because it looks so darned cool No I can deal with it The six disc in dash CD changer is a luxury no annoying cartridge to deal with you just load them all in the slot The car goes exactly where you point it and there is no perceivable torque steer which is something that has always irked me about front drivers In addition to the VIVT system Ford also stuck in some other improvements including forged steel connecting rods aluminum pistons and a dual stage intake system which dramatically improves torque and low end performance The smell of the leather interior is absolutely dreamy and it is outdone only by the way the SVT seat wraps around you and makes you feel completely comfy while driving They fit me so well in fact that when im driving I actually cannot not_feel not_the not_seat not_Say not_what not_You not_read not_that not_right not_Let not_me not_explain You have to be careful when shopping for an SVT Focus because many dealers will charge an extra fee on top of the MSRP simply because its an SVT and therefore more collectible The agressive angular front end mates well with the curved swooping roofline that tapers off in the rear and the custom fog lights rear spoiler and 17 inch argent five star rims that SVT installed put the icing on the cake And although it is defined as a small car it really isnt not_that not_small not_Its not_taller not_than not_most not_of not_the not_cars not_I not_park not_next not_to not_and not_the not_wheelbase not_is not_103 not_inches not_Lets not_talk not_about not_comfort not_now Thats a lot more solid material to transfer sound and you can tell Its not not_bothersome not_to not_me but if it irks someone like you then the application of some aftermarket spray undercoating would take care of a lot of the noise Not only can you adjust the lumbar support back angle and forward position but you can also adjust the ride height of the seat Very nice for adjusting the headroom and seeing over the steering wheel should you need a boost BTW im 6 1 200 lbs just so you can gauge Driving position is excellent and sporty If you find one for MSRP dont not_expect not_to not_talk not_them not_down not_on not_the not_price either SVTs are also usually exempt from any special deals or rebates Having the SVT badge on your car guarantees a certain level of collectibility and the dealers know it Being an SVT owner has other perks as well The red SVT graphic on the panel glows purple under the gauge lights pretty cool I think the stereo controls could have been laid out a little more stylishly but they arent bad They re definitely better than the plastic toy Speak n Spell style buttons that GM loves to put in their vehicles However if you shop around you can find dealers that wont gouge you I found mine at Covert Ford in Austin for sticker 19 265 00 which is exactly what Ford says they should charge Northside Ford in San Antonio wanted 23 K for the same car You know how after you ve been in a car for a while you can tell what parts of the seat are pushing on you Maybe your thighs are pressing against the side supports or the lumbar support is jutting into your back a tad too much or maybe even that darned seatbelt extension is about an inch too long and its poking your beer belly The engine is amazing Ford took the already nice Zetec I 4 found in the ZX3 and cooked up a variable intake valve timing system which ups the HP from 130 to 170 and gives you 145 lb ft of torque to work with Couple this power with the gorgeous Getrag six speed gear box and you have speed on demand through the entire range of the engine Seriously There are no dead spots in the power curve From stop to redline the motor will pull and go like a champ with no perceivable lag anywhere and it sounds great doing it The gear ratios are right on target too Normally with a modern manual transmission esp a six speed I expect fifth or sixth gear to be sort of an overdrive gear not not_worth not_much for performance There is also a radio stereo control stalk that comes off the steering column on the lower left side for easy finger tip sound control while driving In summation when you close the door and seal yourself inside the relationship of driver and car is T I G H T Road noise is a bit of an issue due in large part in my opinion to the low profile ContiSport tires and large 17 rims How tight is it Last night I took a corner that was marked

Pos,The handling is great The looks are cool subjective The interior room and features are incredulous To make a long story short I bought one You may find it hard to believe but it does handle better than the WRX though not not_as not_fast This car is astounding for the price but many may not not_consider not_it not_because not_they not_may not_group not_it not_as not_a not_small not_car not_associated not_with not_the not_younger not_genre This is what front wheel drive should feel like Only problem mine came with a defect the radiator had a hole or puncture warranty item There is no perfect car for everyone rhetorical but if I could be greedy then Id like to see 4 doors ZX 5 more power and all wheel drive like the WRX Out of the models that I narrowed it down to the Subaru Forrester 03 only came with an unremarkable power source the Subaru Impreza WRX kind of suited me but I was a little concerned about the interior room this was a close one I still love this car When I started looking for a new auto I became focused no pun intended on the specification and configuration requirements that were important to me Now to tell the truth I may be a little biased as I generally like Fords and would only consider Subaru as a Japanese auto but nevertheless I still made it my mission to be informed about all autos that met my criteria The upcoming Subaru Baja would not not_be not_out not_for not_a not_while and still only had a mediocre engine Actually I hadnt even considered a Focus Why I wanted to get away from front wheel drive vehicles I had a front driver at the time my first and was a little put off by the quirkiness of its handling characteristics I was about ready to just wait until something came along that suited me and then something made me decide to give the Focus a try I drove a normal 2002 ZX3 and I loved it enough to consider buying it but before I did I at least made the attempt to locate an SVT model
Pos,The sound system is by Ford but they do an excellent job The trunk is deep an especially important consideration for a college student such as myself It is a very roomy car and as a rather big person at 6 2 210lbs I have had no problem fitting comfortably Also there are 2 extra speakers in alignment with the side view mirrors which further beautifies the sound as it envelopes you even more So far it is a clear seamless system which features a detachable radio antennae so that when I go through a car wash I wont lose my FM It just wanted to go I was very pleased with the way it handled turns acceleration reversals and noticed no palpable thumps or rattles which would indicate problem spots However if you are looking to put in a new stronger system with a CD player mine just has AM FM cassette you may not not_be not_able not_to not_because not_of not_the not_way not_the not_Taurus not_radio not_face not_is not_set not_up The power everything features of this car make it quite a pleasure to drive and as for dependability I consistently hear stories of historically pleased Taurus owners who praise its longevity Try one today This car handles like a Grand Am around tight turns even when the speedometer is pushing 40 Acceleration is no problem for this car as I have made it to 100 with ease i I was just testing it i It is too big and basically encompasses the AC and heat control as well so I am not not_aware not_whether not_or not_not not_a not_new not_system not_can not_be not_put not_in not_very not_easily not_I not_have not_a not_feeling not_that not_you not_sacrifice not_performance not_for not_looks not_and not_convenience not_LowDown not_Overall not_however not_I not_love not_this not_car not_An not_excellent not_ride not_I not_feel not_extremely not_safe not_in not_all not_respects The dealer made sure to mention that the rotors may have to be turned or replaced and that I might feel a slight vibration when I break quite the courteous remark no In seeing that I know nearly nothing about cars in a technical sense I sent my older brother to look at it In beautiful shape he agreed that it seemed to be an excellent deal so I purchased it at 7 495 since I paid in cash In dire need for a car to take to school with me in the fall I was looking for something dependable since its a 600 mile round trip as well as affordable since well I dont not_have not_much not_money not_First not_I not_test not_drove not_a not_Dodge not_Stratus and thanks to Epinions I was able to see it would be nothing but a hassle and a money pit So I re scoured the Classified section of my newspaper and saw that there was a 96 Ford Taurus GL for 7995 available Loaded the ad read so I called the guy and went to look at it Surprised that the car only had 65 K miles on it I was thinking that this blue green beauty just might be a vehicular reality for me I took it for a test drive and this 3 0L V6 practically drove itself out of the parking lot
Pos,Has a smooth ride and handles good for a larger car The wiper bolt will not not_keep not_arm not_fixed not_on not_the not_shaft It has made for some comfortable 10 hour trips for four people numerous times This part has aluminum splines and sheered off never to work properly again without modification or replacement Final Comments History I purchased this automobile at 6 K and have driven it on paved to gravel roads Most of the miles on this car have been highway I have replaced two unrelated engine sensors in the 60 K However the weight of the full trunk of luggage and the two people small people in the back seat is a bit too much for the rear suspension It is very comfortable and it didnt not_feel not_like not_I not_was not_riding not_on not_the not_ground not_like not_some not_of not_the not_Honda not_Subaru not_or not_sporty not_autos not_Economy I have driven it These two sensors were backed up in the programming and did not not_disable not_the not_car not_before not_I not_took not_it not_to not_the not_shop not_Look not_and not_Feel On some sharp quick inclines the car bottoms out on the springs and is that is not not_very not_comforting not_Recommendation not_I not_will not_buy not_this not_auto not_in not_the not_future not_when not_I not_need not_another not_4 not_door not_sedan This automobile is more stylish than the GM equivalents that I was comparing it to at the time update your car interiors GM and I have not not_been not_too not_impressed not_with not_my not_previous not_ownership not_encounters not_of not_Dodge not_and not_Chrysler not_products The car averages 23 25 MPG on the highway but does prefer the higher octane 89 and can ping under load on hills when driving slow back roads using 87 octane Body Integrity Body is still in great shape and the paint still has a good finish Wiper arms were frozen one winter and were a problem
Pos,This vehicle is power everything Its an automatic im still young enough to love a stick shift The seats are the epitome of comfort who wants to fall asleep when their driving It is very spacious lots of room for groceries or bodies depending on your hobbies Overall its very comfortable It handles beautifully there is a bare minimum of bumps in the road give me my tracker any day I love bouncing down the road In about 5 years when my husband goes through his midlife crisis and buys that red convertible sports car I guess I will be ready to settle down into a nice old lady car Its nice to know it will be here waiting for me I just hope it doesnt come to soon We purchased a use 1996 Taurus LX earlier this year Now I like the car Dont get me wrong I just feel like a little old lady every time I get into it It reminds me of my grandmother who has always driven a Ford Since my husband is 4 years older than me I ll give him a break The Taurus LX is the most luxurious car ive ever driven but then ive only driven fun cars like Trackers and Eclipses
Pos,There is child locks on the doors and locks for the windows It is easy to put them in and easy to remove them The front middle seat pushes down for easy access to the kids or folds up to reveal a neat little cubby hole for drinks and any other junk you want to hide The best part is that I can still get up and go I love knowing that I can still beat those slow pokes at the red lights and be safe in my Taurus After my daughter was born I just knew that I would have to give up my need for speed Sports cars and kids just dont not_mix not_I not_began not_my not_journey not_for not_an not_affordable not_family not_car not_with not_a not_little not_sport not_and not_never not_dreamed not_I not_would not_find not_it not_in not_the not_Taurus not_My not_husband not_actually not_convinced not_me not_to not_test not_drive not_it not_and not_I not_loved not_it not_The not_back not_seat not_is not_wonderful not_for not_car not_seats
Pos,The truck has a key locking tailgate a nice touch The styling of the truck is also excellent The optional telescoping trailer towing mirrors are large extremely useful and adjustable for wider or narrower trailers If you live and drive in a crowded major city parking will kill you with this truck When driving down the road you sit about a foot higher than most other similar trucks and SUVs The crew cab seats are very comfortable and the leg room in the back is better than most luxury full size cars So the truck is not not_perfect but I love mine very much and wholeheartedly recommended it to others The new Ford Super Duty trucks are the largest tuffest roomiest nicest riding and have the highest available tow ratings of any full size trucks in their class There has been some other minor problems that I have heard from others and one recall notice for a minor fix The drop down window design in the front doors contributes to excellent visibility of any nearby objects and helps in parking etc As a result of this heavier weight the Ford Super Duty trucks get slightly lower fuel economy when compared to similarly equipped competitor trucks Some of it is because the other manufacturers GM in particular have been more aggressive in trying to keep the weights of their trucks down The solid body structure of the crew cab is another contributor to a nice solid and quiet ride The Not As Good Stuff The Ford Super Duty trucks are very heavy across the line Some people have complained of automatic transmission problems particularly when towing moving very large loads in extended extremely hard working situations I have had absolutely no problems with my automatic transmission The Cummins diesel engine is a great extremely durable engine but the Powerstroke is equally durable and has a more modern electronically controlled direct injection system The Ford Powerstroke engine also meets California Low Emissions Vehicle status as does all of Fords Super Duty engines The diesel engine has a very high torque rating of 500 ft lbs and can more easily tow large boats or trailers than the GM trucks with their existing diesel engine or the Dodge trucks with their Cummins engine I know this because I used to own a 1994 Dodge 3500 4x4 with the Cummins diesel engine They are between 500 and 1 000 lbs heavier than comparably equipped models from GM and Dodge My truck weighs 7 200 lbs full of fuel with no one and nothing in or on it That is a lot and more than I expected Some of this weight is due to the somewhat larger size of the Ford Super Duty trucks The crew cab is particularly spacious in the front and rear seats I am 6 2 tall and 225 lbs and I and 5 others of my size could quite comfortably ride for many hours in my truck all the while towing a very large boat or travel trailer I call my truck the 4x4 Limo I love the Powerstroke diesel engine but it is definitely not not_for not_everyone They are simply large and heavy trucks and one must be completely honest about what you really need want and can live with Ps I have a tremendous amount of additional information from my ownership experiences negotiating and ordering the truck and from past trucks that I have owned 1992 Ford 1994 and 1998 Dodge and my new 1999 Ford If anyone has specific questions please feel free to email me at LVSeng aol com Good luck and enjoy Ford has done an overall excellent job designing and building their new Super Duty line of trucks with only a few exceptions I own a 1999 F250 Super Duty crew cab short bed 4x4 with the Powerstroke diesel engine and an automatic transmission that I ordered from the factory and took delivery of in May of 1999 I also recently helped relatives order their new 2000 F250 Super Duty super cab short bed 4x2 with the Triton V8 engine and automatic transmission The Excellent stuff
Pos,This truck is my daily driver The seats are EXTREMELY comfortable My truck doesnt even notice that the trailer is there This isnt not_a not_small not_truck but it is worth every inch and pound I bought this vehicle because I fell in love with it at first site If you want to drive the best truck on the road then get yourself a SuperDuty Then I drove one and fell in love some more I am impressed with its handling it 4 wheel anti lock brakes If you want an excellent truck with lots of options to make everyone happy then get yourself a SuperDuty And since that is what the computer calculates an average that means I am getting better gas mileage than that That is excellent for a V 10 This truck is MY dream vehicle I have a 2000 F 250 Supercab 4x4 Lariat V 10 gas engine automatic I drive all over the country with my job in all kinds of weather and it handles great The drivers cup holder is bigger than the passengers great thinking I tow a loaded cargo trailer as it contains all my belongings that I travel with Like I said I travel with my job ALL OVER THE COUNTRY And everything on the dash is easy to look at with out taking your eyes off the road as well as easy to access I am a 5 7 woman I have no trouble getting in and out I do of course have running boards I usually get 13 4 mpg but when I drive from Mass to CA I usually get 13 8 12 0 mpg The comfort level of this truck is incredible I love it I also love the accessories that Ford offers such as a rear power sliding window wood grained dash front grille guard fog lights I know the 2001 fog lights are standard bug shield an excellent bedliner it is one of the best on the market as it is a Duraliner I also enjoy having a CD player that doesnt hog up my center container Like the 6 disk CD player in the 95 Ford Explorer does I love the computer that is standard on the Lariat that gives the avg gas mileage temp etc I also like the placement of the cup holder in a slide on the dash it is very convenient
Pos,The ride is a little stiff off pavement but very comfortable on the highway The 29 gallon tank on the short bed model needs to be refilled far too frequently The 10 in V10 is about what you can expect for gas mileage in a 4x4 configuration I bought my second F250 Super Duty Crew Cab in August of 1999 and WOW what a great vehicle We have 7 ranches in Texas so I use this truck extensively off road I love everything but the gas mileage and limited fuel capacity The 300 HP V 10 engine pulls like a well trained team of mules the Lariat interior package ensures ultimate style and comfort the crew cab configuration yields room for six the 4x4 is almost unstickable If you are looking for a vehicle that will turn a few heads carry more than groceries and kids go off road with style and comfort and you dont not_mind not_poor not_mileage not_this is your truck Get the Lariat interior the extra comforts are worth the price The carrying capacity is more than adequate as I have hauled in excess of 2500 pounds of feed with no problems I have pulled a 7500 lb farm tractor and it was barely noticeable I bought this vehicle because I needed a pickup truck that had room for my family of four with plenty of cargo capacity
Pos,This car keeps me in high Status with friends The car has great acceleration that never dissapoints me It is a sports car with luxury which is what i really love The only thing I wasnt not_crazy not_about was the fact that you dont not_have not_a not_vent not_button not_its not_either not_windows not_air not_or not_heat The next day I went to see after school I LOVED IT I bought it one the spot PROS When i arrived home my mom was on the phone with my cousin how knew the owner of new dealer and they had a 1994 Ford Thunderbird Though the leg room could be better for such a long car I love the fact that I can set the temp I want in the car CONS My ford thunderbird was first car After a long and dissapointing venture for a used car i finally found my T Bird At First I looked at a Dodge Neon yuck Then a 96 pontiac sunfire but when i made the trip to Greenbrook to the dealer it suddenly sold and The salesman tryed to convince me I wanted a 98 Neon for 11 000 NOPE When i want a sporty looking car its there and when i needed a car to look nice in for the Prom my Thunderbird Was Perfect The Front seats are roomy especially the passanger seat my cousin with a broken leg had plenty of room with her leg straight out The back is very large and comfortable i have contemplated sleeping in the car already
Pos,Who not to buy People that hate to drive in the snow I bought my 94 T Bird back in 1995 it had 22 000 miles on it The reason we bought the car was I like the looks and the way the car performed and my wife loves the interior and the power the car has when she sticks her foot into the V8 engine I also love the car for its ride and its handling it has a tight turning ratio for a car of its size and the speed sensitive steering feels great also I also like the fuel mileage I get 23 mpg and on a 300 mile trip the car got 29 mpg and for a car that size with a 205 hp V8 I was very happy About the only thing I dont not_like not_about not_the not_car is that its not not_very good in the snow but with the right tires its not not_to not_bad not_The not_car not_now not_has not_82 not_000 not_miles not_on not_it not_and not_it not_still not_looks not_and not_drives not_like not_new not_I not_always not_keep not_the not_oil not_and not_filters not_changed not_and not_being not_an not_auto not_detailer not_I not_keep not_the not_car not_polish not_and not_waxed not_For not_who not_should not_buy not_it not_Someone not_that not_likes not_a not_car not_that not_is not_comfy not_and not_the not_performance not_of not_a not_smooth not_V8 not_engine not_and not_handling not_to not_match
Pos,This was luxury for me The seats wrapped around me like a glove the car looked great drove great When I bought it it had 70 000 miles on it perfect interior few scratches My Ford Thunderbird was the first car I ever bought on my own I test drove it straight to the bank I bought it used in June of 1999 There wasnt not_a not_thing not_I not_didnt not_like not_about not_it not_At not_very not_high not_speeds not_NO not_my not_daughter not_was not_not not_with not_me not_instead not_of not_shaking not_or not_floating not_it not_felt not_like not_the not_car not_sat not_down not_and not_hugged not_every not_curve It had automatic drivers seat wonderful interior lighting and rode like a dream I also have a child who rode in a car seat at the time and i never had trouble getting her in or out I never had any trouble out of it other than the transmission needing a rebuild in August of 2000 I absolutely loved this car My husband routinely drove it to his fire and rescue calls because it was faster and easier to handle than his truck I being stupid decided that I had to have a truck and a brand new one at that So I traded it in October 2000 Trust me I would kill for another one maybe a super coupe this time I ended up giving back the new truck that I had to have because I couldnt afford the payments anymore I am still kicking myself because my T bird would have been paid off in July of this year
Pos,The engine is a little on the slow side but it runs great And just for some more reference my father owns the 93 Ranger XLT and it has 165 000 miles on it and it runs like a top It does have some decent power for its size I would highly recommend this truck to anyone that is going to buy one The first set i put on were cheap tires so i went back to the stock Firestones that it comes with off the assembly line I have the 2 3L engine This truck is the best vehicle that i have ever owned My truck has 103 000 miles on it and never had a problem with this vehicle I have put two sets of tires on the truck
Pos,It has enough bed space to haul just about anything you can think of This truck is two wheel drive and it cranks out power I recently bought my ranger from a used car dealer I love it It has the 4 0 liter V 6 It goes through tires with me like I drink water They are relativly easy to work on I have hauled a 24 Rabalo with it The down side is the space you have on the inside I f you are clostraphobic Get an f 150 I am 5 and have no room Other than that I LOVE MY TRUCK
Pos,The one and only down side is they re just what they re called compact They have a 4 0 L V 6 and they haul Over all Rangers are one of the best compact pickups for the dollar If you re tall or need some extra space for cargo get an extended cab for sure because there is no room in a single cab Talk about a nobrainer Ford has some pretty good stuff out there and Ford has been around for a long time as a leader in car productions I bought my Ranger a year ago and is been a great fast sporty trustworthy truck I have just the basic stock 4 cyl standard anti lock brakes and A C You dont not_need not_more not_than not_this not_to not_be not_pleased not_with not_the not_car not_But not_if not_you not_want not_speed not_go not_for not_the not_Ranger not_Splash
Pos,Want a valuable truck without the gas guzzling Buy a ranger This is my second ranger and I havent even parted with my first In both models gas mileage is excellent Out of the 3 years I have owned the 94 I only had to pay for general maintenance My original 1994 ranger has over 150k miles and still runs like new I just bought the 99 for a fresh start but I will keep the 94 for work purposes The only downfall is that it lacks in power it takes a little to get the speed up there but hey at least it helps from not not_getting not_any not_speeding not_tickets If your in the market for a light duty inexpensive truck that will last a long time I recommend highly checking out a ranger and talking to other people that own one
Pos,This feature allows customers to have the 4x4 looks without the high prices Fog lamps bed rail protectors and front tow hooks are equipt as well Air conditioning and a cd player also come standard in the Edge package with a 6 disk changer optional Although the 4x4 lifted look causes a slightly rougher ride it is well worth it just to have the BUILT TOUGH look that it has With this extra package a customer now has much more options to choose from With this new package Ford is adding special features in hopes to satisfy the needs for the young and active customer What makes the Edge Ranger so different from other Rangers you might ask Well to start off the 2 wheel drive Edge has the same amount of ground clearance as the 4 wheel drive Ranger I am a big Ford fan and I have done some serious research on the new 2001 Ford Ranger I learned that Ford has come up with a new trim package called the Edge that falls between XL and XLT packages The 3 0 liter engine comes standard in 2 wheel drive with your choice of regular cab or super cab and style side bed or flare side bed I currently own a 2000 Trailhead Ranger that shares many of the same features as the Edge including the 4x4 look I am completely satisfied with the power and performance that it provides
Pos,And they look good too It has its own floormat what a riot It can definitely get out of its own way The trunk however is the best part of the interior At 5 5 I need the boost im also enjoying the motorized sunroof No looking in the glove box to find the fuel door like on my 89 Mustang The fan set on the coolest setting is just as cold as if the A C were running The handling is smooth and does not not_feel not_tippy not_at not_all not_I not_drove not_a not_Tahoe not_once not_at not_thought The seat has several electronic controls for the perfect fit The passengers in the backseat have access to climate control and radio adjustments The interior is roomy without feeling like a huge machine Everything you need is comfortably within reach and intuitively placed While I am still adjusting from driving a small sedan I dont not_have not_trouble not_fitting not_into not_tight not_spots not_or not_trying not_to not_park I have never been so in love with a vehicle I just bought a used 2001 Ford Explorer XLT in wedgewood blue and it doesnt everything but brush my teeth for me Interior The Explorer is a nice compromise when it comes to size The Rest True gas economy could be better I get 15 miles to the gallon and drive a mixture of highway and city miles However I dont not_find not_that not_to not_be not_unreasonable not_for not_the not_type not_of not_vehicle not_it not_is not_The not_V8 not_engine not_is not_responsive and gives the vehicle all the get up and go it needs There is an exceptional amount of space and a clever roll out shade to conceal expensive items from potential thieves Exterior I find that the Explorer is attractive but modest I think the two tone paints gives it extra class I highly recommend the running boards Id roll at any moment For anyone looking at used SUVs I highly recommend you test drive an Explorer Dont be distracted by the fancy looks of the Xterra or the image of the Jeep Grand Cherokee The Ford Explorer is the best value for the dollar in terms of performance comfort and size
Pos,It has been a very dependable car throughout the years This is one of the best cars that ford has ever made This 91 Taurus has been a great family car for us since we bought it We ve put over 80 000 miles on it and its only been in the shop once for minor repairs There have been a few recalls on it but they were not not_major not_ones not_Overall not_this not_Taurus not_has not_lasted not_us not_longer not_than not_any not_car not_we not_have not_ever not_owned not_Its not_great not_for not_driving not_in not_snow and on ice has lots of moving room in car The engine and transmission is still going strong without any problems I use to hear and read many reviews on a Ford Taurus about how they were the top seller every year and I strongly agree with that I love the power steering cruise control and the front wheel drive I will always stick to buying a Taurus because its worth every dime I highly recommend anyone out there that is looking for a dependable and long lasting car buy a Ford Taurus because they keep going going going
Pos,It will rust leaving you with a nice tri colored automobile 2 The air conditioning is famous for breaking and for a mere grand you can fix it 3 I bought my 91 Taurus from my parents because the prize was right and I knew who owned the car before me I have had nothing but problems with this car 1 The light blue paint on the 91 Taurus is defective There is a problem with the motor for the windshield wiper so it can come on an off when you operate the turn signal I have owned a 90 Taurus as well and encountered exactly the same problems I will never again own a Ford Taurus My parents recently purchased a 2000 Taurus and immediately it began making noises and the dealer essentially said Deal with it If you are looking for a reliable used car from the early 90s DO NOT buy a 90 or 91 Ford Taurus
Pos,This is a must buy car If you are looking for a good car choose this one it also has plenty of space in front and back seats This car doesnt require much maintnence Does good on gas and oil Has good get up and go runs smoothly when going down the road at any speed This is a wonderful car I bought mine as a used car and it was still in wonderful shape it has way over 100 thousand miles on it and it still runs like a dream Most have options such as power seats power windows power steering and more I really can think of nothing negative about this car I really enjoy it Parts are easy to get at any car parts place also parts are not not_very not_expensive not_to not_aquire
Pos,There are fewer bounces and its relatively quiet The ride is much more car like than in my 97 This was due to the old designs thermometer being influenced by cabin heat I own a 97 Explorer XLT thats in the body shop for two weeks The model im driving has spotlamps in the bottom of the outside mirrors The keyless entry keypad is now arranged vertically on the door aft of the window This latest incarnation of the XLT version is certainly evolutionary but not not_revolutionary compared to my middle aged 97 model They no longer pull up rather the whole handle pulls straight out sort of like an old latch refridgerator The outside temp and compass have been moved from an overhead display to a small display thats part of the electronic odometer The rear storage area has more useable floor space because the rear wheel wells are not not_as not_intrusive compared to older Explorers There is some roll when cornering sharply but thats normal for truck based SUV My truck has the big V 6 and while its acceleration is not not_bad not_its not_clearly not_not not_in not_the not_same not_league not_as not_the not_new not_model There are better cupholders and handy bin for fries or sunglasses or a cellphone in front of the cavernous bread box of an arm rest bin Also the retractable cover is situated higher allowing room for taller objects to be carried and still remain hidden under the cover On the inside the door locks are no longer stalks on the top rear of the door but are now toggle switches near the inside latch handles It seems this has eliminated the tendency of the old design to register higher than the actual outside temp on very hot days The mirror controls threw me for a moment rather than the slide selector you now turn a knob to select which mirror to adjust The model im renting has a V 8 engine which provides plenty of ZIP from a both a dead stop and for freeway passing power The engine runs quietly and the transmission shifts smoothly when it should The 4WD drive system retains the Auto High Lo selector although it has changed from a dial to a three push button arrangement When the doors are unlocked with the key fob these outside lights along with the interior dome lights turn on The first thing I noticed when entering the vehicle is the redesigned door handles The outside stylings are more angular with a front face that looks modern yet also is somewhat reminiscent of the Aero era headlight design that almost all Ford cars had in the late 80s particularly the T Bird and Mustang There is a power outlet in front of the bin which helps keep phone charger cords out of the way There is also a power outlet in back for the kids CD players Gameboys There are occasions when seating for five is inadequate Its a nice option for those of us who dread a minivan especially if seating for five is adequate more than 75 of the time The other guys insurance company is renting a new Explorer XLT for me until mine is done CHECK OUT MY REVIEW OF THE 97 MODEL Life with Explorer All I can say is im impressed Ford has the good sense to be content with minor tweakings of the very popular Explorer It appears the tailgate window no longer opens independently from the rest of the gate I found the ability to just open the window very handy especially when loading groceries I have not not_attempted not_to not_use not_the not_rear not_seat not_although not_just not_knowing not_its not_there not_is not_nice The tissue dispenser had been eliminated but a large clip is on the underside of the bin lid to hold the tissue box there Its easier to change tissue boxes but not not_as not_easy not_to not_access not_the not_tissues not_when not_driving not_For not_those not_of not_us not_with not_small not_kids not_that not_makes not_a not_difference not_to not_the not_rest not_of not_you not_its not_probably not_not not_anything not_to not_write not_home not_about The tilt wheel adjustment is a fiasco and so far the only thing I dont not_like not_about not_the not_02 not_Its not_a not_large not_lever not_that not_must not_be not_turned not_90 not_degrees not_to not_adjust not_the not_steering not_wheel not_and not_must not_be not_manually not_returned not_to not_the not_starting not_position not_before not_exiting not_the not_vehicle not_or not_else not_you not_bang not_your not_knees not_on not_it not_on not_the not_way not_out not_The not_radio not_CD not_A not_C not_controls are very similar to what im used to The dashboard while still functional clean and uncluttered uses an odd italic font that I dont not_like not_as not_well not_as not_what not_im not_used not_to not_but not_thats not_purely not_subjective
Pos,The explorer also has a tight turning radius which really helps around town With the third seat laid down the storage area tilts down toward the tail of the vehicle and it seems a little awkward My friend has a 97 explorer and I have to say that this new version drives better and is probably more versatile its people hauling ability It turns considerably sharper than my Pathfinder I dont not_know not_what not_wheel not_tire not_combinations not_you not_can not_get not_with not_the not_explorer but it seemed like it wasnt not_really not_designed not_as not_an not_off not_road not_vehicle not_Maybe not_bigger not_tires not_would not_help I recently used a 2002 Ford Explorer XLT for a week and I really enjoyed driving it The instruments and front passenger area is very well laid out it drives very well and it has plenty of space for a wide variety of things The cupholders and nic nac trays are easy to access and the stereo is easy to use and figure out I dont really like having a third seat in this vehicle as the seat seems kind of out of place I would think if you haul around that many people you probably need a suburban or an expedition I would prefer a more level and taller storage area It is more like a big station wagon that handles well and has 4WD for driving on snowy roads My Pathfinder feels more like an off road truck and I enjoy using it on the back roads and in the woods but I would be afraid to go to many of those places in the explorer Since I am one of the few people who actually use my SUV off roading I would think the qualities that I dont not_like not_should not_attract not_a not_lot not_of not_soccer not_mom not_types not_who not_enjoy not_a not_stable not_ride not_with not_lots not_of not_room not_and not_excellent not_function The model I drove had leather seats a CD tape player and it had keyless entry I like having keyless entry and I especially like the ability to open the back hatch with it The leather was very new and it seems a little tacky but I am sure it will break in and smooth out This vehicle seemed to have lots of options cruise leather keyless PW PDL fog lights thermometer and compass on the dash but I would like to see heated seats cold leather is the worst I have heated leather in my 95 Pathfinder I found the explorer to handle very well in the rain and the steering cornering feels very smooth and manageable
Pos,The ride is very comfortable and quiet The road noise is low inside the van The two middle seats and the third bench seat are removable The exterior color is a two toned with a deep emerald green and lower gold accent trim The interior is a dark parchment with cloth seats and wood accents trim The built in Homelink remote on the drivers visor easily adapted to my garage door remotes The transmission cannot not_be not_disengaged not_from not_Park not_until not_the not_brake not_pedal not_is not_depressed not_and not_held This is my first van and I think this is inherent with all vans and SUVs It has independent adjustable climate controls for the rear with a rear climate control shut off in the front control panel The engine is loud if you floor it but under normal driving conditions the van gives a fairly quiet ride This van came with the keyless touchpad entry feature on the drivers side door daytime running lamps and quad seating with a third bench seat The van holds the road very well and handles wet slippery roads easily with the long wheelbase and the traction control entry and exit is very good The van seems to collect road grime salt and slush on the rear window so I find myself using the rear wiper and washer frequently The automatic transmission shifts smoothly and unless you re looking for for it you can hardly tell when the transmission shifts up or down It has lived up to nearly all my expectations except fuel economy If Ford ever builds these Windstars with all wheel drive then the Ford Explorer will be in very big trouble An extra power outlet is in front by the passenger side and a rear power outlet is at the liftgate the two middle seats have cup holders and the rear seats fold down for extra room for cargo The anti lock brakes do work and keeps the van under control and from skidding When the anti lock brakes take over you ll see the icon appear on the instrument cluster and the brake pedal will pulsate The third seat has little hooks in the back to hook the handles of plastic grocery bags into to keep the bags from moving around and spilling their contents I also received a cargo net for the rear to keep items from shifting The Windstar has many niceties including a small shelf to hold things like a cellular phone a center console with cup holders and storage for CDs and cassettes holders in the driver and passenger doors for maps and other stuff and a pull out shelf with two more cup holders I purchased this Ford Windstar in February 2001 I just put 34 500 miles on my 2001 Ford Windstar SEL after returning to Michigan from Florida Its a very comfortable ride with an excellent suspension high headroom good legroom well thought out ergonomic controls front driver and passenger airbags and rear passenger side airbags The visors have lighted mirrors Interior cargo space is very good allowing me to remove the back seat and put in several pieces of luggage a bicycle and scuba gear including two air tanks I had to pack everything carefully but it all fit nicely The Windstars V 6 engine is more than adequate for mountainous driving I was impressed with the vans performance on Interstate 40 driving through the Appalachians Braking is adequate enough to quickly decelerate the 5 600 van in my opinion im not not_a not_professional not_driver not_so not_I not_cant not_honestly not_evaluate not_in not_technical not_terms not_braking not_characteristics The overhead console provides very good interior lighting a mirror to watch the kids sitting behind you a compartment for eyeglasses or keys a coin holder a holder for a remote and as a really nice touch the top of the dash is textured to eliminate glare and reflections off the dash onto the windshield The only difference between this SEL and the Limited series were basically the solid paint schemes leather heated seats and wood accented steering wheel Whereas Chrysler offers their minivans in two basic body styles a short and a long wheelbase the Ford Windstar comes in the long wheelbase model only The Windstar has surprisingly quick acceleration Maneuverability is so so with the long wheelbase However the third bench seat weighs approximately 70 pounds so it can be a two person job to take the third seat out and put it back in Fuel economy is somewhat disappointing My fuel economy with this Windstar averaged 24 6 MPG with 89 octane mid grade fuel Economy is a little less at 23 8 MPG with premium 93 octane fuel You ll also hear an unsettling grinding or crunching noise but this is normal Also when the front wheels start to spin and the traction control activates the traction control icon appears on the instrument cluster and again you ll hear that unsettling grinding or crunching noise but again that is normal the traction control can be manually disabled by the driver A well equipped Windstar costs about as much as an upscale luxury sedan but is much more versatile while retaining many of the luxury features I wish Ford would jazz up the pedestrian instrument layout and dash I also noticed that water will fall on the door controls if the windows are cracked open while I am driving in rain Overall im very satisfied with the Windstar It has power everything including two power sliding doors 8 way power drivers seat with power lumbar support 2 driver memory power adjusting gas and brake pedals and traction control Other goodies include turn indicators on the outside rear view mirrors and warning lamps when one or both of the power sliding doors are activated an electronic compass external temperature read out automatically dimming rear view mirror trip timer engine message center and low tire inflation sensors I did not not_opt not_for not_the not_entertainment not_package not_with

Pos,Lets talk about interior If anyone ever claims to make a more feature ridden behemoth they are lying A definite buy This beauty had everything mood lights fully reclining seats a fold out bed in back a cooler curtains and a cable TV hookup among various other things In essence it was a van of the gods with no other vehicle before or since with the exception of my Cadillac even coming close to matching its splendor and pure sex appeal If all of this doesnt make you teary eyed with joy you are either a an alien or a communist Plus it has alloy wheels and you can install tables in the middle and back seat rows It was asthetically marvelous with boxy but smooth lines and a ladder on back in case you had to get up on the roof for something Dont turn corners too fast or it will tip over I drove this van for nearly a year after my first car got stolen and let me tell you what a piece of work I proceeded to drive it like a NASCAR but it held up with a spectacular V8 engine supplying all of the horsepower i needed for my various missions
Pos,What do they do different I have no Idea I love this car though I have always though of Ford as a crappy non reliable company but ther Ford Explorer seems to always be good Im not not_buying not_form not_them but this is one hell opf a truck and I suggest you get it It drives great and it could very well be the top truck in the country atleast in my eyes it could be I recommend this truck to everyone and it is a pretty good price also It drives great on rough terrain I go out to cape Cod and bring this truck through the beach and it drives great through there I am telling you this car is awesome if you are smart you will listen to me You may think like me and say Ford is a crappy company
Pos,We are the proud owners of a 1999 Ford Explorer XLT So far we have been quite pleased with the Explorer However we do miss the third passenger seat and the additional cargo space of the larger Aerostar It pulls our trailer about 2000 lbs without a problem with only some loss of gas mileage When my wife are using the vehicle around town we love it for size and convenience At the same time I didnt not_want not_to not_sacrifice not_gas not_mileage not_as not_you not_do not_with not_larger not_suvs But we have taken several longer trips 300 or more miles with the Explorer and have managed to have enough room for luggage cooler chest Christmas packages etc The vehicle handles very well and is easy to park and maneuver in parking lots After driving an extended 94 Aerostar mini van the Explorer seems much smaller and easier to navigate We purchased it because we wanted a vehilcle that can handle western New York winters carry two adults and two older teenage sons and pull a large pop up camper trailer There has been one recall so far replacement of the secondary hood latch which was handled promptly by the dealer Just last week we noticed that cold air seems to be coming in through the left rear door speaker On roads that were somewhat slippery for my Aerostar the Explorer felt very stable and would not not_skid not_or not_fishtail not_when not_I not_pushed not_it not_a not_bit not_So not_I not_ll not_update not_this not_review not_again not_when not_I not_get not_a not_chance not_to not_play not_in not_some not_deep not_snow The dealer corrected this by adding insulation to the door no charge Overall the quality craftsmanship of the vehicle is quite good Overall if you want a SUV that has decent gas mileage and is smaller than the Expedition Excursion or Suburban the Ford Explorer is a good choice When not not_towing not_gas not_mileage averages around fifteen miles per gallon or slightly better Although it doesnt have the soft comfortable ride of our old 89 Crown Victoria the ride quality is pretty good With the SOHC V6 engine there is some noticeable engine and road surface noise nothing more than you would expect with a truck If you need larger towing capacity or want more cargo capacity then you will have to sacrifice gas mileage and go with one of the larger vehicles 1 14 2000 Update Well winter driving has arrived in western NY and today I found out how well the Explorer handles on slippery snow packed roads and I am very pleased with the results
Pos,The leather interior great factory sound system nice lines shape When I ride in a car now I really feel like im dragging on the ground I bought my Eddie Bauer Edition of the Ford Explorer a little over a year ago and I love it more every day This is controlled by just slowing down a little more than you might on normal street conditions safer anyway It is wonderful to be able to see over traffic and not not_feel not_boxed not_in not_by not_larger not_vehicles This is one of the best purchases ive ever made and definitely the best vehicle purchase of my life I will most surely be a repeat buyer This was purchased to replace an older car and a lot of thought was given to the SUV vs car dilemma I opted for the SUV for the flexibility it offered ie hauling moving things without having to rent a truck camping etc I really love the luxury of the Eddie Bauer Edition There are a couple of downsides that I wasnt not_really not_aware not_of but can live with They are that unless you are riding in the drivers seat it can feel like a fairly rough ride and when the streets are slick it does tend to slide more than a car
Pos,My parents bought this vehicle because of its overall power and luxury It has a big triton V 8 engine that provides enough power for this vehicle My parents own a brand spankin new Ford Explorer and I can not not_believe not_the not_extra not_qualities not_it not_has not_compared not_to not_other not_SUVs On our Explorer we have the Eddie Bauer package which adds more luxury inside of the vehicle which is almost to much to better I think that the options this vehicle gives you are almost unreal It also comes with a 4x4 package which is nice for the winter time or if you want to take this vehicle off road I recommend this vehicle to every person looking to buy a very nice SUV for a reasonably price
Pos,It has a super ride The interior is very plush The sound system beyond anything I ever needed The handling and ride superb Lots of cargo space for luggage for trips or for carring the groceries Stright and to the point For a 4wd station wagon it is great I was a truck user and had been for years thought it was time to move up to a SUV Biggest mistake I ever made First lets talk about the great things that the Explorer is It is a great family car Now dont try to help someone move with it because all your going to put in it are the small boxes I used mine to help my daughter move from one apartment to another Way to many trips took forever Own a home and need to do some lumber hauling golly dont want to get wood slivers in that nice carpet or just cant not_get not_that not_4 not_x not_8 not_sheet not_of not_plywood not_in not_the not_back not_I not_would not_highly not_recommend not_this not_SUV not_to not_anyone not_who not_is not_looking not_to not_buy not_a not_station not_wagon not_or not_a not_really not_nice not_family not_car
Pos,IU think that the explorer should atleast have the 90 mark on this chart not not_the not_87 not_that not_like not_a not_and not_i not_personally not_would not_give not_it not_a not_A not_its not_one not_of not_the not_smartest not_I not_purchased not_my not_Explorer not_on not_Jan not_5 not_99 not_i not_have not_had not_it not_a not_year not_already and i have to say its excellent it rides like a baby and i love that i truly would recomended this car to anyone who wants something that will last practically forever and very dependable on the road i enjoy my 4x4 espicailly when i got exactly what i want for only 27 125 00 for it GET one today youll love it you will be very safe in it in all the crash test ive read 2 companies said it was a excellent and 3 said good and 1 said acceptable and other than that NO poors or marginal thats great i want something that is safe and well assembled very carefully put together GET ONE TODAY
Pos,The seats are comfortable and adjust easily One concern would be the history of the manufacturers past failures but to this point I am thoroughly satisfied This is definitely the SUV all families or truck van enthusiasts should consider when shopping for a vehicle The capability of this vehicle to corner is also very surprising SUVs are known to be dangerous in higher speed maneuvering but the Explorer and Ford has seemed to located and lock in on the center of gravity for this vehicle I recently purchased the Ford Explorer and quite honestly have never been more satisfied with a vehicle purchase as I am with my Explorer Upon my test drive of the Explorer I noticed a very highly detailed interior which is both driver friendly and easily navigated I was very pleased the with the power in take off as well as the vehicles ability to pick up speed once already moving
Pos,The interior is nicely arranged with all knobs and handles easily within the drivers reach It requires very little upkeep maintenance and retains its resale value very well For the money its quite a bargain There are also controls in the back seat for the music system and air conditioning and heating system The rear cargo area is ideal for transporting my equipment and testing kits leaving the back seat for passengers Of course one drawback is the tendency for this vehicle to roll over in an accident but it is equipped standard with two airbags and seatbelts which should be worn at all times On the positive side the Explorer rates very high in overall safety and in crash tests the drivers AND passengers in the Explorer have fewer injuries and deaths than most other vehicles I drive mostly highway miles but I find the gas mileage to be very competitive with more economy minded vehicles The Ford Explorer is probably the most ideal SUV manufactured today Its the perfect size both inside and out I am a school psychologist who travels about a school district that is over 900 square miles so I log many many miles weekly The Explorer is very comfortable and easy to drive
Pos,Thus it has fulfilled our purposes And my wife enjoys driving it also Thus I spray it clean often during such weather It is a truck but a very refined and well equipped truck One year and 17 000 miles later I am still pleased The Explorer had the most space a convenient 4wd system good towing capacity a proven reputation and the best pricing We have towed heavy trailers for about 1500 miles during the past year at highway speeds with absolutely no problems We have an XLT with 4 0 SOHC engine and moonroof I live close to the Canadian border But if your purposes are similar to mine the Explorer would be a good choice to look at When a dealership offered me 1000 below invoice in an honest upfront manner with 0 9 financing that closed the deal We can easily carry groceries pets lumber up to 11 sports equipment or whatever inside with plenty of space The spare tire is also exposed underneath SUVs do not not_get not_as not_good not_gas not_mileage and cannot not_handle not_emergency not_maneuvers not_i not_e not_rollover not_avoidance not_like not_a not_sedan We have had no mechanical problems only normal maintenance Gas mileage has been 15 19 mpg which is not not_good but about what most equivalent SUVs also register Thus they would not not_be not_my not_choice not_for not_a not_crowded not_commuter not_expressway not_The not_Explorer not_is not_not not_highly not_rated not_as not_an not_offroad not_vehicle not_other not_SUVs not_with not_a not_shorter not_wheelbase and more ground clearance may be better It starts fine in 20 degrees it drives well on unplowed snowy roads and the anti lock braking system works as designed Driver visibility and maneuverability are excellent better than I expected in an SUV My only complaint has been that it is difficult to keep the underside of the vehicle clean during winter when snow mud and salt splatter up underneath it There are many irregular spaces between parts and panels where crud can get lodged rust and corrosion would be expected to result When I buy a vehicle I start with the purpose I want it to fulfill then I look for vehicles that can handle the intended uses at a reasonable price and in a reliable manner I wanted a vehicle that could carry a fair amount of cargo in an enclosed space could handle deep snow and slippery roads and could tow a trailer or boat I looked at the Grand Cherokee 4runner Montero Sport and Explorer as well as reading about others
Pos,I definitely recommend this baby But if you get hit head on or from behind you will more than likely live with its cushy seats and major safety packages Go buy one right now dont not_look not_at not_anything not_else not_especially not_the not_95 not_Mustang not_its not_flawed not_greatly and I know I own one Its also fun to play with I love the little thing that tells what direction im going in normally called a compas but its just a thing when its in a vehicle I guess It also tells you the temperature outside the heat comes on really fast it has all kinds of cool little things I can do with the seat including tilting and deciding how high I want the seat and how soft I want it REALLY COOL It would kill my car off the line Snow is not not_a not_problem not_for not_this not_beast not_ive not_been not_driving not_in not_some not_great not_Michigan not_snow not_so not_far not_this not_year and I havent slipped at all Now one issue is getting hit from the side well im absolutely positive you d do a rollover if hit from the side this thing almost rollsover when going through mountains after being hit by a heavy sidewind Its big but it doesnt have a very good center of gravity thus making it an easy target to rollovers or other problems Woohoo I love this thing Its way better than my Ford Mustang that I have I have been driving my 99 Ford Explorer around quite a bit lately and ive noticed that I can hit curbs I can drive through the snow at speed limit I can run of squirrels and not not_notice not_them not_I not_could not_probably not_even not_take not_out not_a not_frew not_children not_in not_a not_school not_parking not_lot not_and not_never not_know not_However not_I not_wouldnt not_exactly not_call not_that not_a not_selling not_feature not_Its not_got not_some not_amazing not_pickup not_Its not_V not_8 not_makes not_it not_faster not_than not_my not_Mustang not_in not_pickup not_but not_not not_in not_the not_long not_run
Pos,So does my fuel gauge They tend to limit the second rows knee room And when its windy be on alert My rear windshield wiper has a mind of its own That is it Everything else is thrown under wear and tear All the same its still irritating as the mechanic said this with a snicker But there were so many problems and not not_one item was covered under the warranty One last thing Fords extended warranties I did not not_purchase not_one not_with not_mine It has become mandatory for me to reset my trip odometer and fill up every 222 miles There word really 100 to tell me its a 3 problem I know its like that everywhere Easy enough to remember Ford said they will be happy to do an exploratory check on the problem The side step rails that come with the Sport model do tend to rust I suggest waxing those while you re waxing the body It is safe to say if you decide on purchasing an extended warranty from Ford mine cost 1100 it will cover the engine the tranny and the drivetrain It may help a little I was considering the purchase of a new 2002 Explorer Sport After thinking back on the lack of CS I quickly came to my senses The key to a good Ford Explorer is to explore the history first Know what you re buying people I currently have 52000 and change on mine Check with Carfax regarding the cars history Here is why I previously purchased a 1998 Ford Mustang GT with 46 K on it Three years old at the time Problem after problem my fault for buying a used 0 60 car I know This of course carries over from the Bronco II model An Explorer Sport is basically a revised Bronco II which were known for there compulsion to do the 2 wheel tango A bit more stable with this model however On the 02 model I just cant not_get not_passed not_the not_plastic not_bottom not_I not_realize not_most not_cars not_are not_plastic not_in not_this not_area but at least they are painted plastic Call me picky it just looks cheap And now Ford is cutting costs even more by moving to a plastic

mechanic down the road Unless Ford can improve greatly on the CS this will no doubt be my last Ford For me quality in the vehicle is equal to quality customer service Love the ride just not not_the not_ride not_to not_the not_dealership
Pos,Now lets talk about the cargo area The seats fit my back wonderfully and there is so much room in it not not_only in the front but in the rear passenger area When I go to the Sams Club to purchase bulk items I dont not_worry not_about not_where not_I not_am not_going not_to not_put not_everything There is so much room plus I have the option of folding down one side or both sides of the rear passenger area to make even more room On one particularly lengthy trip my husband and I folded down the rear passenger seat spread out the childrens sleeping bags and they were as happy as clams at high tide I am absolutely thrilled with my SUV I purchased my 1999 Ford Explorer 2 X 4 SUV in May I have had severe back surgery and needed something that was elevated in height so I could get in and out easily I needed something that was big enough in the back seat where my two small children wouldnt not_constantly not_complain not_he not_she not_is not_touching not_me
Pos,It has everything i need The 99 Ford Explorer Sport is a FUN fairly affordable and safe vehicle It is easy to drive and rides very smoothly for a truck based vehicle The inside is easy to use and looks nice complete with fun and handy compartments and buttons Because there are so many options it is very individual and suits personal needs I bought the car over other SUVs because of its wonderful safety records and have been very impressed with its performance since Contrary to belief about 2 door SUVs the back is very roomy and comfortable
Pos,The people who want to buy it is someone looking for a bigger vehicle We bought the Ford Explorer because it had more room than the Mazda Protege we used to own I absolutely love my truck It may be a little more expensive than some other Sport Utility Vehicles and that might make a person not not_want not_to not_buy not_it My husband and I bought it with all wheel drive all the time I like the way it rides it feels like we re riding on a pillow The only complaint I have about it is that it guzzles gas but thats because in order to get the all wheel all time you had to buy the V8 The V8 has awesome pick up its the 5 0 engine that used to be put into a Mustang Its a lot of fun to drive
Pos,The car has been repaired and it drives as good as ever Knowing what I know I have much comfort driving Ford Explorer has been good to me I am a recent buyer of the Ford Explorer and out of all the cars and suvs ive had this has been the best one yet It has an extremely smooth ride and gets pretty good gas mileage for an suv Best of all depending on how you look at it I was recently in a car accident with it and by looking at the car you would have thought I would have been seriously hurt but I walked away with just a few bruises
Pos,Thank you FORD It is worth every penny At 3300 pounds that makes this car a 500 horsepower monster You will be hard pressed to find a more reliable car with this kind of performance If you are looking at a used 97 or 98 Cobra I would encourage you to buy quickly This car is made in very limited quantities of about 3000 per year and commands a particulary aggressive type of owner On long freeway trips with the cruise control on I average 25 26 miles per gallon thats 2 better then my wifes V6 Taurus At 35 000 miles I have changed the oil and the spark plugs only Thats it No minor or major mechanical problems even with the aftermarket parts I have put on This is indeed a fine example of American engineering and beauty The car runs a 13 9 second quarter mile in stock trim and is good for about 160 mile per hour top speed I put the Vortech supercharger on mine the week I bought it as well as some aftermarket suspension parts from Steeda This car is a very driveable rocketship A Viper eating Porsche embarrasing American made musclecar that is as beautiful as it is fun Turns heads at every corner and the rear wheels at the drop of a hat Every stoplight becomes an adventure and every gas stop becomes a conversation The fastest stock production vehicle on the road today is a twin turbo Porsche 911 at 110 000 I own an American car that is a half a second faster at a mere savings of 75 000 now what could be wrong with that But even better is the driveability and the mileage This car never fails to turn heads and on the rare occasion that you see another one the freeway you are gauranteed to see a waving hand and a smiling face I cant not_say not_enough not_about not_this not_car not_except not_that not_I not_would not_buy not_it not_again not_today not_even not_at not_full not_price First I must point out that the estimated price for this car is wrong I own one and the base price with no options starts at 26 390 Mine has every option except the leather which was a free option but since I live in the heat and I hate hot leather on bare skin I declined the leather This was easily the best money I spent on the car as it only continued to get better Driving this car has got to be as fun as the owners of the original 1964 thought because not not_only is it one of the best looking American made cars on the road today but it is also one of the fastest I have had it to the drag strip three times now and have run a 12 6 et 121 mph pass with the stock tires on the car and a full tank of gas Now you motor heads out there do the math
Pos,The car drives like a more expensive sports sedan The ride quality suffers as a result but we knew it would We do wish the car had more interior room especially in the back seat They cost roughly 15 each All of the other problems were covered under warranty As annoying as any trouble with a new car is we have taken it in stride The check engine light came on but that is a common problem on all cars with current emission control systems There might be a better model today but put the Contour on your list and at least give it a test drive There have been numerous malfunctions that have required dealer service Ford has issued 5 recalls for this model for different reasons The fuel filler tube to the gas tank inexplicably became constricted to the point that it took 10 minutes to fill the tank We made the decision that while the Accord or Maxima might have better build quality and lasting resale value we could not not_justify not_the not_3000 not_to not_5000 not_premium The smooth V 6 has a lot of power to offer at any speed and the suspension is tuned to give the driver a lot of confidence We have gotten used to the ample power the V6 provides and the sporty handling in addition we still find it to be one of the more attractive cars in its class On the other hand if you can find a low mileage used one you might save yourself some money Overall I would say that we are happy with our decision based on the choices we had at the time Do not not_plan not_on not_taking not_long not_trips not_with not_adults not_in not_the not_rear not_seats not_After not_3 not_years we still have things to like about the car but there are some things that must be considered if you are looking at buying one The most troublesome thing we have experienced is that there are pieces of trim that cover the jack points below the doors that will not not_stay not_on not_We have noticed that there are a lot of Contours on the road with the same problem We still feel that the car was a good buy and plan to keep it until it has about 75 000 miles on it You might not not_want not_to not_consider not_this not_car if you plan to put fewer miles on it than that because the residual value on Contours is not not_good We own a 1998 Contour SE equipped with the 24 valve V 6 The car was built in October 1997 and we have put 30 000 miles on it since we bought it new We compared the Contour to the Honda Accord and Nissan Maxima but found those models a little out of reach for our budget We also drove the Dodge Stratus Pontiac Grand Am Ford Taurus Mazda 626 and the Nissan Altima Although those models were similarly priced we did not not_feel not_that not_they not_could not_match not_the not_Contour not_in not_drive not_quality not_performance not_interior not_ergonomics not_and not_exterior not_styling not_We not_purchased not_the not_Contour not_knowing not_that not_for not_less not_than not_17 not_000 not_we not_were not_getting not_an not_attractive not_American not_car not_with not_the not_features not_we not_wanted
Pos,So yes the car has its flaws The interior is quite comfortable and the 8 way adjustable power drivers seat is a nice touch a memory function would have been nice though Despite the criticism the Contour has received ive found the car to be fast comfortable and a joy to drive It seems that they got just about everything right in the 98 model year and it missed the major decontenting that occurred in the 99 and 2000 models Id say its probably about the same as most other cars with a similar sized engine in the 20 25 mpg range the 30 mpg highway rating from Ford is probably a bit too optimistic The 1998 Ford Contour of all the cars I have looked at puts forth the best combination of looks performance and features with a minimal of problems for under 10 000 But in that time I have drove it regularly and its always performed as good or better than I expected Gas mileage is good but not not_great not_however not_this not_is not_my not_first not_car not_so not_I not_have not_no not_basis not_of not_comparison not_However For most people who dont not_bother not_tinkering not_with not_their not_car or who relegate that task to the specialists it shouldnt not_even not_be not_an not_issue not_Unfortunately not_I not_cant not_give not_any not_hard not_info not_on not_reliability not_or not_long not_term not_performance not_as not_I not_have not_only not_owned not_the not_car not_just not_less not_than not_three not_months As you can see though most of them are relatively minor and overshadowed by the cars great performance and price After reading up on probably dozens of other contenders ive come to the conclusion that just about ever car in this price range will have a host of minor flaws and negative points The interior lighting is a little dim the car would have benefitted from a centrally located dome light which I understand is on the Mystiques and may have been on older model Contours Rear seats as most have said arent the most spacious in the world but I dont not_see not_them not_as not_much not_of not_a not_problem not_at not_all not_Adults not_will not_definitely not_fit not_although not_it not_may not_not not_be not_comfortable not_for not_very not_long not_drives not_not not_really not_any not_different not_from not_just not_about not_any not_mid not_size not_car not_though So what are the real flaws I havent found any yet besides the fact that Ford and especially the Contour doesnt have such a great reliability reputation I havent had any problems so far however and hope it ll stay that way Its probably worth it though knowing that I saved a few thousand dollars over a same year import car you know those reliable Hondas and Toyotas Watch out for that depreciation though while it means I was able to get a great deal on the car to start with it also means I cant not_expect not_much not_a not_few not_years not_down not_the not_line not_when not_it not_comes not_time not_to not_sell not_it not_Its not_a not_trade not_off im willing to take though For just over 9 000 in early 2001 my 1998 5 I still think my 20 K mile 1998 5 Ford Contour SE V6 was a great buy The SE trim level also features traction control ABS and other features that are great in the winter and arent found on every car at this price level ive found it handles great around curves or daily driving while acceleration is quick and responsive im sure the V6 helps in this regard ive never driven the Zetec 4 cyl but I understand some feel its a bit sluggish in a car of medium size like the Contour Whatever the case the 170 horses put out by the 2 5L Duratech are plenty and highway cruising lane changes and quick acceleration prove no problem At higher speeds the engine is a bit loud although many like it that way so its just something to consider I tend not not_to not_notice not_as not_my not_upgraded not_speakers not_and not_subwoofer not_prove not_to not_be not_a not_nice not_way not_to not_drown not_out not_the not_engine not_noise not_Speaking not_of not_that though consider yourself warned if you plan on adding speakers or other upgrades the contour isnt not_the not_easiest not_car not_to not_mess not_around not_with not_Each not_of not_the not_4 not_stock not_speakers not_are not_in not_the not_doors not_none not_in not_the not_rear not_deck not_like not_most not_cars not_which not_means not_taking not_the not_entire not_door not_apart not_to not_replace not_them not_Routing not_wires not_and not_such not_is not_a not_bit not_of not_a not_pain not_as not_well not_as not_Ford not_has not_chosen not_looks not_i not_e not_concealing not_screws not_and not_wires not_in not_very not_difficult not_to not_reach not_locations not_over not_upgradability
Pos,A little backstory Thats at least three years away In another year I ll be getting a new car In my family we buy cars out of necessity The seats are supportive and overall the interior design is very clean But you can always tell the Contour from the rear end though But so far I cant not_say not_that not_I not_disagree not_with not_her If you re buying from a dealer dont not_skip not_the not_extended not_warranty not_offer The light cluster and combination of reflectors and chrome reminds me of the Lincoln Continental just shrunken down The cabin has poor sound insulation road noise is excessive Overall Overall the car is a real prince If I had my druthers I would prefer the 2 5 liter 6 cylinder SE or the SVT There are some notes about buying a used Contour though 1 Take the SE or SVT over the GL or LX trim levels And the combination of higher horsepower 195 horses in the SVT and the road handling of the SE or SVT would surprise most BMW 3 series owners You will be so much happier with the added power 3 Check the service records before you buy the Contour or any used vehicle for that matter On style and fit The 1998 model look more like a shrunken Taurus than the econo box Escort Overall the Contour has very clean lines even if its a little generic We found a 1998 Ford Contour SE with 10 000 miles on it Now I knew of the horror stories about this car the endless parade of recall notices and all of the repairs that follow With that bag in the car my answer to anyone who asks is always sure I ll play Beyond being under powered my only substantial complaint about the Contour is the interior noise The GLs and LXs that ive seen read about and driven seem chintzy inside and dont not_handle not_as not_well not_as not_either not_the not_SE not_or not_SVT not_2 Get the 2 5 liter 6 cyl over the 2 0 I4 if you can If you re buying from a private person and they dont not_have not_the not_maintenance not_records or cant not_tell not_you not_where not_it not_was not_taken not_for not_service not_be not_very not_careful not_something not_aint not_right not_4 not_Get not_a not_warranty And if you re buying from a private person check with the finance manager at your local Ford dealership like the dealer that maintained the car for the previous owner to see what they will do to put you into one It has a charming personality with just enough styling comfort and handling Its a shame they stopped making these little go getters in the US Ford dumped the line and makes the Mondeo in Europe the Jaguar X Type and the Mondeo are both cousins of the

a minimum think about getting an engine and drivetrain warranty to cover you for as long as you re making payments on the car you will thank me later 5 Be religious about vehicle maintenance Fords tend to be very spiteful when you neglect them We have the mini van see 2000 Chevy Venture review but we wont be getting rid of the Contour My wife will take it back and forth to Annapolis and she

month for the old car with no payments than I would on a newer car with the payments and higher insurance premiums I ll dump the old one Time to shop On the Powertrain Suspension Its the SE w the 2 0 liter 4 banger Although the acceleration on the 4 cyl w auto trans is relatively weak it handles very well and the braking is superb All Contours have independent suspensions and rack pinion steering My SE has the 15 in alloys and 60s all around Put them all together and its like im glued to the road A word about drivetrain choice The flip down seats in the back and the roomy trunk are big pluses too ive got my roadside repair kit golf clubs and diddy bag back there but I still have room to go grocery shopping or mall hopping Side note Okay you re asking whats a diddy bag its the backpack where I keep a change of clothes shower stuff and my golf shoes I confess im a horrible golfer but rarely pass on a chance to play The guy who sold it to us it was his fathers before the he pasted away and I think the family had more affection for this car than they did for the old man had all of the service records showing that every recall something like 8 or 9 of them had been addressed and that the car was regularly serviced I figured the rough patches in the cars history were over and that anything that could go wrong with the car already did
Pos,We are from Branson Missouri Bought a Ford Contour SE January 1999 The spunky 4 cylinder engine took the turnpikes like the big boys Was really impressed with the acceleration onto the ramps Decided to take it on vacation to Maine The Contour was very economical comfortable and a joy to ride and drive One of the s is that there was some road noise not not_really not_irritating but had to turn the radio up louder than im used to playing it and another was the airbag light malfunctioned We drove from eastern Pennsylvania to home in one day 16 hours and because of the comfortable ride we arrived home not not_too tired and not not_at not_all beat up from the long drive Ford Contour you have my vote and also my next vehicle will be a newer Contour Dwight Rogers Branson Missouri The design of the windows lets you view a lot of the outdoors which also made it very enjoyable I would recommend a Contour to anyone who appreciates economy smooth ride and sorta of a sporty look I feel the s certainly out number the s
Pos,We bought a 1998 Ford Contour in 1997 and at first were so happy It is a smaller car but with 4 doors and a good sized trunk it was roomy enough for our family of 3 at the time Then slowly things started happening First the air stopped working then we would get things in the mail every few months or so about a recall on the car Once it was the head lights another time the breaks and another time the air conditioner The seat belts are constantly getting jammed and with 2 kids and a seat belt law we need our seatbelts to work properly Ford was always happy to fix these things as the car is still under warranty but it is just bothersome to have to keep taking it in and being without a car for a few days at a time
Pos,This car in every trim level handles like a dream Wheel bearings are a common failure on this car as are water pumps Do your best to find out if the water pump has been replaced If you happen upon a Sport model or SVT you should definitely take it for a lengthy test drive If you find a Zetec the 4 cylinder model and its a stick shift play with it in the high RPMs In other parts of the world namely Europe the Mondeo their version of the Contour has done reasonably well and the newest model has won accolades since its inception The test drive will be more enjoyable and convincing if you can find a nice twisty road to experiment on Listen for things like engine howl or strange rubbing sounds coming from the wheel area If Ford had really taken this car under their wing it truly could ve been the World Car they were hoping it would be But with ads seemingly only placed in Womans Day and Parenting magazines its no big surprise sales were poor Take care of it and it ll take care of you If you happen to own one or are seriously looking to buy one stop by http www contour org and visit us Thats the website for the Contour Enthusiasts Group and we ve ran across and fixed almost every problem you could face on a Contour Hope to see you there So it is possible for Ford to build a great car but it seems recurringly impossible for them to bring it to the Us without butchering it With that in mind you should definitely consider a Contour if you happen across one during your search for transportation Understand though that it helps if you re a car person when you drive it Why Well thats hard to explain unless you are a car person If the car is over 60 k miles and still running the original water pump you may want to consider replacing it They have a habit of breaking internally which can result in engine failure if you dont not_catch not_it not_soon not_enough not_I not_happen not_to not_own not_a not_Contour not_with not_the not_Zetec not_engine not_I not_have not_replaced not_the not_water not_pump not_but not_thats not_about not_it not_The not_car not_is not_very not_comfortable not_on not_long not_drives not_and not_I not_really not_stress not_the not_engine not_everyday not_With not_regular not_maintenance not_notice not_I not_said not_regular not_maintenance not_not not_15 not_000 not_mile not_oil not_changes not_the not_car not_should not_last not_you not_until not_you not_re not_ready not_for not_something not_else
Pos,It has been an excellent car no trouble for 23 000 miles It is quiet and trunk space is excellent the space in front is fine Rear is not not_huge not_but not_ok not_for not_kids not_or not_short not_trips not_with not_adults I have leased a 1998 Contour GL for 2 years and will have to decide whether to buy or lease it or another car in October so I have been thinking about the car a lot My model is a 4 door 4 cylinder automatic with cruise pw a c It handles very well and I havent seen the need for the available larger engine though all the pro reviewers say the 6 cylinder larger engine is smoother I used to have a BMW 325 and this cars handling is not not_as not_good as that but it is better than my Audi 100 for example I know that the Accord gets better reviews but I just cant not_complain not_about not_this not_car
Pos,We finally gave up and we now here the noise when we descend across a flaw in the surface the road bed Highly affordable was a key factor in initial purchase Warranty very much considered as a premium value Appearance comfort of ride and roadability Great selection of installed options Economic to operate We have experienced three recalls to dealerships Fuel filler neck would not not_accept not_fuel not_about not_the not_second not_week not_after not_we not_purchased not_the not_vehicle not_Dealership not_where not_we not_purchased not_the not_vehicle not_disassembled not_the not_right not_suspension not_exhaust not_and not_fuel not_tank not_and not_we not_made not_about not_10 not_trips not_to not_different not_dealerships not_trying not_to not_get not_noises not_created not_by not_the not_repair not_of not_the not_fuel not_filler not_neck
Pos,The defrost works very quickly Ahhh the precarious income of a college student The paint has held up very well There are some annoyances some small some large Id like to see the cupholders placed differently There is no fading or peeling only the normal scratches and dings from everyday driving The drivers side window squeaks when lowered A lubricant will probably help The engine will pull OK in 5th on flat or very slight grades You can see it start to kick in in a few seconds The bad primer and flimsy finishes that plagued pre 93 Rangers is no more The same minor electrical annoyances persist And the hard plastic steering wheel is very slippery sliding right through the hands in tight turns Best decision I ever made was begging for this truck for my graduation present The Ford Bedliner has started to loose its grip on the bedrail in a couple spots Of course I would never want this engine with an automatic Highway passing though is a little different So far so good no big problems never any hesitation on startup You gotta put it on full blast to get any distortion and the base is impressive Id like to see that setup in the Ranger Id also like a different manual door lock design The dealer quoted me 360 dollars to replace it That will have to wait Also the on off button on the radio no longer works properly so the radio stays on all the time So I had the pads replaced and the shoes remachined at Pep Boys which seemingly did good work Some have criticized my trucks mileage When I found it it had 38 000 miles on it and was sitting used on a new car lot There were also ocasional traffic jams and highway slow downs If you dont not_need not_to not_pick not_up not_speed not_quickly not_at not_all you ll get by in 5th most of the time It does not not_affect

blind with no manual dexterity and fingers the size of pickles to have any problems operating anything while driving The clutch feels just as strong as new I think they put particularly good ones on the manual transmissions in this truck All the goodies a college freshman could want Sometimes I wish for the 3 0 or 4 0 liter 6 but im more than satisfied with the power my engine makes It was a 95

not_57 not_800 not_miles not_7 not_1 not_00 The stubborn interior light whose fuse was pulled and the gauges that occassionally act up though thankfully they stull are functional Though I have a base ranger with pretty low payload its hauled everything ive ever needed it to I somehow packed everything I own in it for the 2 hour drive to school At speed the steering is accurate with little free play and nicely weighted But in parking lots you ll have to twist it a few times to get out of tight situations ITs also extremely useful Theres lots of storage with a center armrest doubling as a storage bin with slots for coins and a pretty big glove box I dont not_know not_why not_peole not_complain not_so not_much not_about not_the not_2 not_3 not_being not_gutless My temperature gauge dies on me at about 48 000 miles Usually when this happens its a sensor that must be replaced for about 18 dollars Its extremely rare for the actual gauge to die Lucky me They sit at the base of the shifter on the transmission hump I have to reach way too low to grab sodas ive seen S10s where the cupholders retract from the front of the center console This tank was about a 50 50 mixture of hard accelarating jack rabbit starts and stop and go city traffic and 75 90 mph cruising on the highway with occassional downshifting to fourth If I drove more gently at all times which I am sure I probably never will 25 overall should be reachable We chopped up a tree that fell in our lawn in the last storm and holled the logs away in only a couple trips I even threw 24 cynder blocks in the back while making a quick run to Home Depo with a friend Thats roughly 19 mpg I know I know less than what most would expect from this type of truck but keep in mind thats with my jackrabbit starts in the city and 75 85 mph cruising speeds on the highway On the inside the interior light goes off when its supposed to about 80 percent of the time and the rest of the time when it gets annoying I pull the fuse A sensor in the door probably either needs to be replaced or cleaned off The brakes needed to be replaced at about 55 000 miles a little earlier than what im used to but then again I do tend to drive like teenager because thats what I am I also had to make a few panic stops The firestones werent really done for yet but I happened to have money at the time and figured it would be wise to replace them when I could rather than wait till they were bald when I might not not_have not_any not_money The check gauge light comes on quite often though I have it serviced regularly and nothing has been found wrong with the truck Really hard bumps seem to trigger it quite often 95 was such a bad year for electricals But I think averaging about 20 mpg is pretty good for a lead footed pickup driver I also think there was still a few miles left and believe I could have reached 345 350 miles total on this tank for about 21 mpg It helps that its a 5 speed so that its easier to make the most

need 4th But to really pick up speed fast like from 60 or 65 to 75 or 80 and get out of a tight spot or jump into the fastlane without slowing anybody down you wont get any real acceleration above 3rd

gallon tank is now 287 miles but I think theres the potential to do better and maybe surpass 300 I put fuel injector cleaner in with the last tank I also think part of it is that im a little scared to dip too far into that reserve past E but im gonna go for it and update on the mileage soon The fuel light had been on only a few minutes when I finally filled up I think my numbers should have been at this level from the beginning but it has taken me awhile to get up the nerve to dip into that reserve past E and get as close as possible to an almost empty tank for an accurate reading without stranding myself somewhere There is some steering pull to the right under hard braking despite the fact that there are only 10 000 miles on the brakes and I got an alignment about 4 000 miles ago Fuel economy has stayed the same at about 19 mpg mpg though I havent gone from tip off to near empty in awhile so im gonna try it again soo and see what happens Through it all with only the basic

hiccup was a winter day in subzero temperatures in which I stalled by slipping the clutch too quickly and it took a few tries to get it started back up Other than that im never disappointed when I

good full tank of 16 5 gallons for 332 miles or about 20 1212 mpg with what seemed like a good 15 20 miles left Get it to rev to the sweet spot between 2500 and 3500 rpm before you dump the clutch or shift in every gear and and those 4 cylenders pull pretty damn hard and I almost forget im even driving a four banger truck engine till it runs outta steam after about 3000 rpms and the engine whine becomes noticeable Part throttle at low speeds in first and second gear gives a healthy push Drive it right and it ll jump off the line pretty agressively I know ive certainly never had to beg my way off of an expressway onramp There are some annoyances though 95 was a pretty bad year for elecrical systems so if you want a used ranger get one from 96 on Interior light sometimes stays on for up to 45 minutes after I get out and occasionally stays on the whole time im driving Wipers are posessed sometimes they ve come on without me turning any switches Remember to put that parking break to the very VERY last notch before you get out and maybe even leave it in gear otherwise it ll roll Armrest is starting to come loose from the seat So aside from new brakes which has alot to do with driving

half way mark and its already taken me 180 miles or so I expect low 20s when I tabulate it Update Range this time around with 60 highway cruising at about 75 85mph and around town driving came to 318 miles total exactly from top off until I lost my nerve after having driven several miles past when the low fuel light came on The bed cover stayed down almost the whole time and I definitely thinks it helps me gain one or two mph im going to try to be even more conservative in my driving with this tank and see if I can break 320 im thinking it probably wont get much better than low 20s overall no matter what I do Maybe a K amp N filter will snag me another mpg But then again thats with most vehicles and ive never found myself lacking for power when I really needed it The breaking is just as almost as good as on my parents Corolla Stops are short without any fishtailing and not not_much not_nose not_dive not_ive not_had not_to not_do not_panic not_stops not_in not_rain and still never felt like the truck was getting away from me Handling is pretty good to The Firestones grip very OK but I think I have the suspension design to thank for the handling more than anything else Ride is OK with big bumps or smooth roads its a whole lot of small bumps close together that upset it The only time you have to be careful is fast bumpy corners or wet turns where it reminds you its a truck when the rear end does the jitterbug or slides a bit when unloaded The latch meckanism on the sliding rear window can be flimsy Ive locked the keys in the truck and been able to get in with a screw driver so you might want to put a lock on it or look for one without it if security is a concern I really wish I had gotten one with air I think more should be standard in the xlt package Basically I love this truck all the important things are done right theres just some minor annoyances that I can easily live with Good economical useful stylish transportation Since I got it I have added a 6 disk CD changer and various cosmetics such as body color matched tail light covers blacked out headlight covers ventvisors bug deflector shade blade and soft tonneau cover some know what all that stuff is and some dont but suffice it to say when I learned about the huge custom product market available for puckups I went nuts and I probably still havent finished Update
Pos,It was incredibly reliable An extended cab would have solved this easily They re stout and are VERY reliable The long bed would have been a little better for hauling too The only thing I didnt not_like not_about not_the not_truck was the small cab The 2 3L 4 cylinder was a little under powered though it got good gas mileage I have to say that the Ranger is possibly the best purchase I ever made And unfortunately I wrecked it It was a nasty accident but I came out with only a scratch And I also have to say it was one of the safest I ever made I had a 1995 Ranger XLT So it gets my vote for safety I loved the truck because though it was small it served its purpose well and was NEVER in the shop The best I ever got was 33 mpg I had an aftermarket exhaust on it and I removed the intake silencers which helped both power and mileage The 33 mpg was steady driving at 55 ive heard thats a little rare but if you dont not_mind not_going not_a not_little not_slower and are gentle with the throttle its not out of the question But with the standard cab and short bed I kept the weight down which helps mileage and helps the 4 cylinder get going a little better I would recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a truck
Pos,The backseat does not not_have not_enough not_legroom not_for not_any not_normal not_sized not_adult You wont be using Rear Seats much unless you have a dog or children The dual exhaust provides a throaty reassuring feedback whenever you step into the gas pedal After driving a bike for so long the fun factor outweighed practicality and the truck idea was shelved The driver seat is just big enough for my husky 5 11 frame but I would imagine its tight for those over 6 This means a bit more care when it comes to cleaning them but they look great There are 2 GT models the Deluxe and Premium I found the Deluxe quite acceptable and in fact have only one added option the Mach 460 sound upgrade With the hot summers and excessive traffic in Phoenix the asphault near stoplights is often heavily worn Startingly deep ruts appear in the road surface at times While all vehicles have a tendency to follow these ruts a bikers nightmare the Mustang seems to me a bit worse than normal in this regard Id been riding a motorcycle exclusively for eight years when I decided the time had come to get back on four wheels for awhile The drivers seat is powered and firmness can be adjusted but it feels like a compromise some comfort some support The GT Deluxe comes with 17 alloy painted wheels It tends to show the most during a firm brake for a stale yellow light About 80 of my driving is stop and go city traffic driving I get 19mpg just about every tank The mean streets of Phoenix Arizona are not not_known not_for not_their not_kindness not_to not_two not_wheelers not_I not_had not_looked not_at not_a not_number not_of not_sporty not_cars and I was also considering a pickup to help out with the household chores On a long trip I once broke 23 and the very first tank was 17 I am absolutely happy with this purchase I love driving it and I have been spoiled by seriously fun motorcycle driving It is subdued enough that you wont be annoyed by it during everyday city driving You can always crank up the tunes if you opted for the Mach 460 sound there is an even better Mach 1000 option I do have an unfavorable reaction to stoplights It looks great and though the car gets it share of attention you dont not_look not_like not_you re having a mid life crisis or compensating for something I hope Ford continues to manufacture this pony for a long time as this style gets harder and harder to find see Camaro The muscle car era was over before I got my first license but there are still a few cars out there that continue to capture the spirit of the original pony car The 2002 Mustang GT incorporates the long hood short trunk style of the first 64 1 2 Any Stang enthusiast will also recognize the channel extending from the front quarter panel to the rear simulated brake scoop on each side You ll appreciate them if you re a fan of curvy mountain roads ABS and traction control also add to the feeling of control when pushing this car but if you just have to do a big tire smoking burnout and fishtail you can disable traction control with a dashboard switch Make no mistake the GT is fun to drive The dual cowl dashboard and mustang emblems on the seats also evoke memories of the classic Ford ponies Unfortunately both the brake scoops and hood scoop are tacked on for show While that previous era Cobra Jet could claim some performance gain from increased air flow all these decorations get you is a more difficult time washing your car Water just loves to adhere to the hood scoop honeycomb front and release after the hood is dry With typical Arizona hard water this will leave long water streaks for you to clean again I find the 02 brake scoops overdone while the previous years I found stylish When I bought the car I wanted no options but the only black 5 speed manual on the lot had the 460 sound system 460 stands for 460 watts peak output I must say factory car audio has improved greatly since my last car im one who traditionally ripped out the factory system within days and replaced it with something listenable I have no such desires after 2000 miles of driving in my GT With a 6 CD changer in dash MP3 compatible plenty of speakers and all optimally placed I have enjoyed this system far more than any other ive ever had The DSP effects are worthless but there is one set of modes ive found invaluable Setting for Driver Only All Seats or Rear Seats really does work as advertised and perfects the sound for those areas
Pos,On a highway trip this last week I averaged 25 mpg with the AC running very impressive This car is significantly quieter and quite a bit more sticky on the road than my 98 too The quadra shock rear end design along with the other structural traction improvements to the rear end makes this car a good handler on the highway and on twisty roads I bought my 2002 Mineral Grey GT at June 1st I had owned a 1998 GT and loved the performance for what is classified as a mid performance vehicle As far as overall power so far im quite happy with the pick up I have also noticed that the sweet range for this car is in the sixty plus mile per hour range When I bought my new car I expected nothing less I have been doing a lot of city highway driving and I must say that im very impressed with the mileage for an eight cylinder 22mpg This is where I can definitely notice the additional horsepower over my 98 All in all I would have to say that this is my favorite Mustang of the two ive owned so far On the performance side its a bit too soon to tell I like to break my cars in a bit and dont not_like not_to not_push not_them not_much not_before not_to not_first not_oil not_change not_I not_actually not_bought not_this not_car not_for not_less not_than not_I not_paid not_for not_my not_98 and it comes with a few additional features that the 98 didnt not_have not_such not_as not_traction not_control not_anti not_lock not_brakes not_and not_a not_6 not_disc not_CD not_changer not_Ford not_had not_dont not_a not_first not_class not_job not_holding not_the not_price not_on not_this not_car not_in not_the not_last not_four not_years not_I not_honestly not_believe not_that not_this not_is not_probably not_the not_strongest not_contributing not_factor not_to not_the not_Mustang not_being not_the not_ruler not_of not_the not_performance not_car not_kingdom not_for not_the not_mid not_performance not_level not_cars not_Fords not_continues not_to not_improve not_this not_car not_at not_every not_turn
Pos,For a factory system it is not not_sheepish not_at not_all This car seems more sedan like than the older models The options to customize your tunes and their sounds is also nice The same simple plain interior options were a let down in that they were boring It thumps base like I have 15 subwoofers and the 6 CD dash changer is also lovely The V 6 is powerful although not not_as not_powerful as a matched model of some other pony cars but it is punchy My 1998 was a five speed but I could only get the paint and interior I wanted in automatic which does not not_totally not_disappoint not_but not_take not_off not_can not_be not_draggy My 1998 had an option where you could have the fan placed at your feet and upper body at once that option is out in the 2002 I will state I am in love with my sound system The interior seating has seemed to change in that it is more plush and classier I did not not_go not_for not_the not_leather but I am thinking more I should have Ford should seriously rethink the interior options via the dash I am loving my 2002 premium coup mustang I have the silver body with the dark charcoal interior I must admit however after owning a white 1998 pony I was disappointed to see the interior had not not_changed not_much not_at not_all The long hood is still there and I happen to like the over sized scoops on the premium coup models Bottom line this is a sexy car that moves just as sexy just be careful on the slightest curve Wear your seat belt so you wont feel you are being thrown out The only drawback assuming cassette tapes are not not_used not_as not_much not_is not_the not_2002 not_model not_I not_have not_does not_not not_come not_with not_a not_cassette not_player not_in not_the not_dash not_the not_1998 not_model not_did but it also had only 1 CD you could have in dash I am the typical mustang enthusiast I love the throaty deep growl the car possesses and you can even get this without upping the extra 3000 4000 for the GT model I like the smoother than normal ride for a sports car I get from my Stang but the rear wheel drive can be tricky especially in rainy weather The ABS and tracking system Ford has installed kind of gives a little more peace of mind to the driver I was also blown away at the horses on this engine
Pos,The body dents very easily which can be very costly to repair In particular I love the 94 models style when compared to the earlier and newest models First of all I live by myself in a dorm in downtown Austin The interior is not not_the not_quietest not_place not_ive not_encountered and the rattling and squeaking noises can be an annoyance But my fears were unfounded the inspector didnt not_even not_find not_any not_minor not_gasket not_problems not_when not_we not_turned not_it not_in This body style will be a classic for sure Passenger wise it is a great single or two person road trip vehicle This car was bought for around 10 000 and it is certainly worth the money as far as I am concerned It may not not_be not_the not_fastest not_car not_on not_the not_road but I loved this car and would recommend it to anyone who asks As the car approached the 70 000 mile mark I began to get a little concerned about the rumors drifting around about head gasket problems on this model In the three years that I had access to it it proved itself to be very dependable and still ran great in spite of having 70 000 miles on it when we traded it in I did not not_consider not_myself not_then not_nor not_do not_I not_consider not_myself not_now not_a not_car not_aficionado not_by not_any not_means but this was one of my favorites of the cars that I drove My complaints are minimal I dont not_like not_to not_drive not_fast not_so not_the not_fact not_that not_its not_3 not_8L not_engine not_doesnt not_have not_the not_sound not_or not_power not_of not_other not_cars not_didnt not_affect not_me not_much not_although not_my not_friends not_made not_quite not_a not_joke not_out not_of not_it not_It not_can not_still not_beat not_most not_cars not_off not_the not_line not_with not_a not_5 not_speed not_manual not_but not_drops not_into not_the not_backfield not_rather not_quickly not_Another not_thing not_I not_noticed not_is not_that not_bugs not_tend not_to not_take not_off not_too not_much not_paint not_on not_the not_hood not_and not_front not_bumper not_not not_to not_mention not_the not_pealing not_and not_chipping not_of not_the not_paint not_right not_behind not_the not_wheel not_wells not_Mud not_flaps not_would not_dramatically not_fix not_this not_problem There is little or no parking available where I live and most of the places I have to get to are within walking distance Also I have a couple of friends that always seem to be willing to drive me around Because of these reasons I really have no need for a car I have owned a few however Actually it was mostly partial ownership as my parents technically bought them and just let me drive around in them ive used these cars enough to form an adequate review I believe and that is what I intend to do right now The Ford Mustang has always been a great looking car with relatively decent gas mileage about the same if not not_better than previous 4 cylinder cars I have used
Pos,A diamond in the rough This car is a dream to drive power comes on smooth as silk and goes till u let um reving out at 7000 rpms this little rocket gives more than enough power to pull out on the highway or cut some corners on your favorite back road Once in a corner u can grip the whell and push the peddle down till your nerves give in with no worry baout losing control of traction i have driven many sports cars includeing 4 chevy corrvetts years 1990 91 94 95 all owned by my father and the PRobe GT may not not_have not_top not_end not_or not_pick not_of not_the not_beast not_of not_a not_car not_the not_vette but it sure can make u stay in your seat and hang on for your life in tight corners
Pos,But the looks alone would make up for that Your standards of comfort will be forever altered The overall vehicle is very easy to maintain with relatively few problems You really must at least test drive one of these cars When I get in it and start driving I feel like I could go on forever The seats are perfectly contoured to my body and the steering wheel isnt not_one not_of not_those not_hard not_skinny not_ones not_which not_I not_hate The mustang would even make a good car for the family if you dont not_mind not_the not_two not_door not_as not_opposed not_to not_four not_door not_for not_loading not_the not_kiddies The ride for the most part is generally smooth sailing although being low to the ground you really have to watch curbs and pot holes more so than in another vehicle The airbags are of the design that would not not_blow not_up not_in not_your not_face not_but not_rather not_split not_down not_the not_middle not_Only not_the not_airbag not_itself not_makes not_contact not_with not_you not_I not_know not_this not_from not_personal not_experience My car has 74 000 miles on it now and I am just now having to replace a few parts here and there Nothing major or highly expensive Just a wheel bearing and the brakes from normal wear and tear I bought this vehicle primarily for the prestige and looks rather than reliability or rating Overall I am happy with my mustang though she is and can be tempermental I was amazed at its affordability and comfort I must stress COMFORT
Pos,It acts as a magnet to other cars bumpers I have been driving my 1994 Mustang GT Convertible V8 5 0 for about 8 months It is a beautiful car and a pleasure to drive with its power and great handling But I really feel that a bright red convertible draws more cars to collide with them Now for the downside in these 8 months of joyous driving I have been hit 6 times So the transmission slips and cars seem to flail wildly about when they are near this one but who cares Once I was sideswiped twice I was rear ended at traffic lights and three times I was hit while parked or stopped in a parking lot Maybe I have bad CARma It is as fun to drive as it is attractive Its a car that you can drive and actually enjoy yourself Ample room for four but small enough to fit in those all too prevalent compact car parking spaces Another problem the car has is that in many 93 95 Fords the transmission has been known to slip an operation which costs about two thousand dollars to repair and I am currently undergoing the operation for the third time this time under warranty thank heavens It is a beautiful car made to run on 87 octane which saves money and now is very inexpensive to buy Buy one keep it for two years and then sell it just so you can have the experience of driving this fine piece of magnetic metal
Pos,This vehicle has been a very solid reasonably reliable hauler My 1987 Ford Taurus GL station wagon was purchased new in Columbus Ohio My car has low miles 140 000 over 16 years regular maintenance and easy driving style The large and versatile cargo area adds incredible utility enough to fit a full sized bicycle without taking the wheel off The 140HP 3 0L Vulcan V6 is rock solid but delivers tepid acceleration Brakes no ABS available are no better than adequate but the car handles predictably even in adverse conditions We ve used Goodyear Aquatreds which certainly help in the wet and snow Highway ride is pretty good up to about 75 MPH after which things become loud and jiggly The wagon has been used to tow a 1000 lb trailer without issue Personally I think the original 1986 1995 models are the best looking wagons ever produced the smooth proportionate aerodynamic shape influenced EVERY car produced since The car is comfortable to drive and the handling is really outstanding for its day Remember this is the car that saved Ford and wowed the world with its Audi class handling and driving dynamics in 1986 This car is still good looking after 16 years people are amazed when I tell them how old it is These days a 1987 Taurus can be a good choice for either a durable inexpensive beater or a piece of American automotive history NOTE The speedo only goes to 85 after 16 years this is not not_a not_speeder not_Reliability and durability have been surprisingly good BUT this is a Ford and keeping up with maintenance is important or it ll come back to bite you Long term problem areas include alignment issues tires wear out rather fast in this heavy front drive car issues with random stalling but it always started up again immediately or within minutes and coolant system problems The car is not not_happy not_in not_continuous not_stop and go city traffic and can overheat and spill coolant Rust is a big factor in the older vehicles stay ahead of it or it will attack doors and rear wheel wells Original generation Tauruses are said to have problems with A C and transmission A C no problems but rarely used but transmission has slow leak after 140 000 miles and I think could be busted up much faster under hard acceleration Good news parts are cheap and plentiful Insurance costs are low
Pos,No wonder is the best selling car in Europe The car is very well equipped for the money Lots of space and nice unexpected features everywhere My dog loves the car and hopefully the trauma of riding in the minimalist back seat of the Mustang is forgotten and forgiven This was way back in August and since the car is almost 5000 miles old I believe I can make a fair review While leaving the lot to take a Midnight Edition Escape I glanced at a bunch of little Focus Station Wagons and finally left the dealer in one of those The front wheels are permanently dirty due to fast fading brake pads I suspect but so far the braking power has been adequate and enough I really like the instrumentation and the interior design In the meantime I am enjoying the ride and the money saved Focus is a very good car that Ford consciously failed to make a great car Only they know why The dealer had none of these wagons with manual transmission traction control or airbags so despite the fact that I was willing to pay the extra cash for such features I had to leave the lot in an automatic Ford Focus ZTW Although the engine power is rather modest the wagon is kind of fun to drive due to great on road dynamics Fuel economy not not_as not_good as advertised but pretty decent and improving with time Now its making about 23 mpg So far I have not not_experienced not_any not_of not_the not_problems not_and not_mechanical not_failures not_that not_many not_people not_have not_reported not_here not_Just not_a not_very not_annoying not_squicky not_noise not_in not_the not_rear not_that not_hopefully not_the not_dealership not_will not_be not_able not_to not_take not_care not_of not_when not_taken not_to not_the not_5 not_K not_service The other day I was looking at a sales brochure for the European Ford Focus and couldn 146t believe how spartan the American version is when compared to the one over there Features like climate control better headlights chrome inside door handles hood lock backseats headrests The initial quality problems plus the failure to offer many of the features offered in Europe cemented Focus 146 reputation as a very unreliable cheapmobile bad for Ford and even worse for the owners whose resale value will be greatly affected I own a 2002 version in which most of the problems supposedly have been already addressed but I suspect that such fact will be of little help when the time comes to get rid of my ZTW I used to own a 2001 Mustang convertible but had a terrible experience with the dealership not not_the not_car and fortunately got them to buy the car back it was THAT bad I might review this experience in the Mustang section I decided to give Ford a second chance and since in the meantime I had adopted a 100lbs dog I decided to take a look at bigger vehicles With the Ford Escape in mind I went to a different dealership There is storage space everywhere in the cabin Inside the car feels much larger than it actually is The only objection to the interior would be that the seat cushions feels short I am only 5 148 and not not_heavy and in long rides the seat makes its presence known I mean a seat cushion is not not_something not_you not_should not_think not_about not_unless not_its not_really not_good not_I not_don not_146t not_want not_to not_think not_how not_a not_larger not_guy not_would not_feel not_after not_an not_hour not_in not_one not_of not_these
Pos,Our biggest problem with the car She had never let us down The interior of this car was roomy enough for our family of three We went and talked price and drove away the proud new owners of a 4 door 94 Aspire My husband is tall at over 6 and never had a problem in this car Not having a lot of money we decided to look at used vehicles The car dealer had a few 94 Ford Aspires on the lot and we decided to try them It always perks my spirits to see her Even better yet it means she still is running It was a very sad moment for us as we had seen a lot and done a lot in that Aspire of ours We test drove a nice burple color one as it became known to us since the color was a cross between blue and purple In 1996 my husband and I having just recently had a baby set out to get ourselves a new car since the 89 Escort we had needed some work The only thing was to get enough merging power we would have to turn off the A C This car diligently moved us from California to Louisiana and then to Alabama with no problem The windshield hummed at any speed over 55 Unfortunately at 60 000 miles a large promotion and the thought of another child we decided that it was time for us had come for us to trade our Aspire for something larger with more options This car actually seems bigger then the Escort to us Many people have complained about the power in this car While we found that you could not not_expect not_0 not_60 not_very not_quickly not_it not_did not_perform not_well not_enough not_for not_us not_I not_mean not_we not_are not_not not_racecar not_drivers We traded her in and said our goodbyes and before we even took delivery of our new car her new owners who bought her right after we traded it in were driving her out We watched her drive down the road and I must say it was like watching the end of an era for us On a lighter note we do see our Aspire around town every now and then
Pos,The car model was purchased and marketed in the states by Ford before Kia made its move in the American market As I now see it anyone who wants an affordable reliable and fun car should get this one But if you are looking for performance and style steer clear this is not not_the not_car not_for not_you not_FYI not_the not_Ford not_Aspire not_is not_actually not_a not_Kia not_Avella I bought my Ford Aspire in 1994 brand new off the lot I paid 9000 out the door I had cruise control and a stereo added and later replaced it with a CD player The car was 80 Kia and 20 Ford If you are looking for a car similar to the Ford Aspire in todays market check out the Kia Sephia the body style and features are different but under the hood is pretty much the same At first I didnt not_like not_the not_car not_the not_interior not_was not_plain not_the not_engine not_had not_no not_get not_up not_and not_go and I had to put up with the wise cracks about how I was driving a washing machine on wheels This is all the repair I have put into the vehicle and it is still going strong I predict this car could go 180 000 with proper maintenance and I only paid 9000 dollars for it What a deal But now 6 years later I still have the car my husband drives it now and with 125 000 miles on it the car is still going strong 500 miles a week commute I have put 2 brake jobs on the car changed the tires all around 3 times changed the battery once had one tune up and recently replaced a rotor in the engine all in the 6 years ive owned the car Not to mentioned the car has slid into two ditches and hit a curb hard which inturn it needed two front end alignments and a new rim
Pos,Other then these mechanical problems we do like our Windstar Its roomy comfortable easy to drive The 900 I paid for the warranty was money well spent So far I have had 1800 worth of work done using my extended warranty The computer had to be replaced at about 52 000 miles covered under extended warranty The front tie rod had to be replaced at 68 000 miles covered under extended warranty That doesnt even include the head gasket and engine rebuild that Ford paid to fix The head gasket had to be replaced at about 56 000 miles covered by Ford due to a faulty gasket problem My wife was looking for an SUV a couple of years ago and I talked her into a mini van The v6 3 8L does fine pulling the trailer but eats a lot of gas The Windstar has the cargo capacity of an extended Dodge Caravan The engine had to be replaced at 73 000 miles covered by Ford for the same problem as the head gasket A note to all Windstar owners We pull a pop up trailer with it but you cannot not_find not_air not_shocks not_for not_the not_Windstar not_so not_all not_you not_can not_really not_get not_is not_heavy not_duty not_shocks not_to not_pull not_a not_trailer Got it back from shop with the new engine and now the transmission fluid is leaking I finally got it back to the Ford Dealer and he said it was the seal at the torque converter Another 50 on my extended warranty We picked out a 95 Windstar because it had everything we wanted V6 engine to pull a camper seats seven extra cargo space and a reasonable price used Our Van had 34 000 miles when we purchased it We now have 74 000 miles and had a number of minor and major problems Luckily we purchased an extended warranty and have not not_had not_to not_fork not_out not_too not_much not_cash This helps on grocery day or for trips I would not not_recommend not_an not_older not_model not_Windstar but I would hope the newer models have all the bugs worked out For all you older model owners cross your fingers and save your pennies repairs could be in your future David Since writing this opinion I had a sensor for the EGR valve go bad which cost 134 to fix and It was covered on my extended warranty Ford will replace your engine up to 100 000 miles or reimburse you if you already had your head gasket replaced or your engine replaced After comparing problems with a friend of mine I was alerted to a transmission problem and a break problem with the 95 Windstars I have not not_had not_any not_problems not_with not_the not_brakes not_or not_transmission but if I do I hope they come before my extended warranty expires
Pos,The transmission is sensitive We own a 95 Windstar The second and third seats are removable but not not_on not_wheels You must always use your emergency brake on the slightest incline Heavy second and third seats If you dont not_have not_it not_lined not_up not_JUST not_RIGHT you will not not_really not_be not_in not_park not_drive not_reverse not_etc You can see everything around you very well No terrible blindspots at least for me Handling Drives like a car not not_a not_large not_van not_Bad not_points Buggy transmission With the rising prices of mini vans a used one is a good option for many people and 95 Windstars are easy to find and reasonably priced for a family We bought ours in Nov 1997 and it had 30 000 miles on it We bought it because of its safety rating safest mini van made and its roominess It has a 3 8L engine which makes all the difference in the world Mileage As minivans go it isnt not_bad not_I not_can not_get not_about not_380 not_400 not_miles not_on not_one not_tank not_21 not_gallons not_Visibility The second seat can be removed by one person without much trouble but the third seat really takes two It is not not_impossible not_just not_a not_pain not_Overall not_I not_really not_like not_the not_vehicle not_and not_would not_buy not_another not_and not_recommend not_it not_The not_pros not_outweigh not_the not_cons not_I not_happily not_put not_up not_with not_the not_heavier not_seats not_and not_lack not_of not_drivers not_side not_sliding not_door not_for not_the not_extra not_room In the last 2 1 2 years I have learned a lot about this vehicle ive driven it in snow wind rain long trips etc Good points Roomy one of the largest mini vans made Plenty of leg room in the first and second row An adult can stand bent over next to the seats and maneuver children and items fairly easily Fast The Windstar has great pick up which is vital when getting on busy highways
Pos,The long wheelbase helps provide an absorbent ride The Windstar is adequately powered at best Gas mileage on our van has averaged 18 20 mpg If not not_keep not_on not_looking not_The not_Windstar is a quiet comfortable vehicle with a good view of the road The rear seatbacks fold flat in an instant an option I use a lot to haul my bike in the back The Windstar meets our needs as a family of five very well Now that its paid for we plan to run it into the ground The cabin is comfortable up front a bit claustrophobic in the rear Didnt get the rear captains chairs but after riding a few hours in back recently I wish we had The rear seats are difficult to remove for hauling but once they re out you have a huge space for cargo My 95 Ford Windstar at 90 000 miles has settled into a comfortable middle age but it went through a lot of grief to get this far An automatic transmission rebuild and head gasket replacement are the two major repair items so far Anyone looking to buy a used 95 check to see if the head gasket on the 3 8 liter engine has been replaced
Pos,We had our first problem with the sliding door The sensors would go off and the chimes would start We decided to trade it in and buy a bigger vehicle We bought a 95 Windstar about 4 months after they came out in April of 94 Took it back several times but could not not_find not_a not_problem not_with not_it not_They not_even not_tried not_adjusting not_the not_door The seats were alot more comfy I would recommend this van to families Overall it really never let us down until the end It would not not_shift not_into not_first not_gear not_after not_stopping not_Xmas not_was not_not not_the not_time not_to not_give not_me not_problems not_with not_an not_upcoming not_trip not_home not_for not_the not_holidays We had owned two Aerostars previously I loved driving it We made alot trips in it and it never left me on the side of road We had finally payed it off this past September and thought we would be without a car payment for a couple of years Wrong In December with 69 000 miles on it the transmission was acting up For the most part it was a good van it served its purpose while we had it IT was getting small for since we have teenage boys and they are all over 6 feet tall I liked the ride better than the Caravan We finally figured out the problem if you get the contacts wet or they are dirty even just a little then that will set the chimes off and turn the interior lights on WE didnt not_have not_any not_more not_problems until a trip to Phoenix and the check engine light came on Took it in and is was an oxogen sensor Had to have the brakes done at 30000 miles IT took four times to get it right I blame that on the dealer
Pos,There is lots of cargo space Then I just turn around and hop in the drivers seat It is the best purchase we could have made We have a large wagon and we just plop in in the back for day trips I have a 1995 Ford Windstar and I think it is the best around I have three kids ages 3 2 and newborn There is plenty of legroom THe most I have seen in a minivan Even being very pregnant I can drive the Windstar comfortably Also we are campers and there is plenty of space for our tent action packers and cots Even all the extras we need for baby like a pack and play I highly reccommend the Windstar It is so easy to get them in and out through the side door I never have to worry about leaving my oldest on one side of the car unattended Plus the van is roomy enough that I can strap them all in easily
Pos,How the vehicle holds up to a family We are a young family of 5 and our 2 youngest 4 amp 5 have grown up with this being our only vehicle The gas mileage 3 8 ltr engine is a little less than I would like about 23 highway and 15 city The only things we ve had to replace or fix in five years is a power window motor and one a c relay switch IF YOU HAVE KIDS AND NEED A VEHICLE A 5 year owner and I dont not_like not_FORDS but I do like this one I own a 1995 Ford Windstar and love it I have had it long enough to know whether Id buy another or not not_What not_really not_matters not_when not_owning not_a not_van not_in not_addition not_to not_reliability We have never had any major problems with the van and people still are amazed to find out that the Van is nearly 5 years old and still looks new What I am getting at is that we have not not_done not_anything not_above not_normal not_maintenance not_and not_cleaning not_maybe not_even not_a not_little not_less not_than not_the not_average not_person and the van still looks good inside and out The fabric does not not_show not_wear not_or not_stains not_the not_carpet not_has not_maintained not_its not_look not_as not_well
Pos,The gauges are in full view and well lit My most recent purchase was the Ford Power Stroke Diesel Model year 1997 The stereo works well with front and rear factory speakers and provides a good balanced sound I have owned a lot of different vehicles over the years for various purposes including four different pickups One is that the transmission I have the three speed automatic with overdrive is weak The temp gauge often sticks in the normal operating position during an overnight cool down my brothers does the same thing The fuel mileage is good for a working rig with a big mill 17 mpg w o the trailer on 12 w the trailer These same mechanics have also recommended to me that the transmission be regularly serviced at least as often as the manual recommends and more often for any significant pulling The trucks digs right in from a dead stop and accelerates well even with the trailer on There two things to be wary of when considering this vehicle The other thing to remember to consider is that being a Diesel regular oil changes are a must Changing the oil and filters are spendy considering it has a two quart filter and a fifteen quart oil capacity It can not not_stand not_to not_be not_overheated not_much not_at not_all not_and not_so not_it not_needs not_to not_have not_an not_auxiliary not_transmission not_cooler not_for not_any not_significant not_pulling not_the not_mechanics not_I not_go not_to not_have not_recommended not_to not_me not_that not_it not_should not_have not_at not_least not_a not_3 not_loop not_cooler My only complaint here is that the clock literally gains a minute each day which I dont not_think not_should not_happen not_with not_a not_fully not_electronic not_unit not_The not_Air not_Conditioner not_works not_very not_well not_as not_does not_the not_heater not_both not_are not_musts not_in not_my not_book However this is a minor cost considering that with regular maintenance some of the diesel trucks have gone 500 000 miles with out a major repair BODY AND COMFORT AMENITIES rating 7 out of 10 The engineers did a good job of putting together a nice cab seats etc on this particular model amp year The truck also exhibits a wide turning radius which again you get used to but it would be nice to be able to turn in a narrower radius in parking lots and on back country roads OVERALL rating 8 out of 10 I really enjoy the truck It pulls nice and I feel that I could do almost anything I wanted to do with it it has the power that I need yet provides the comfort space and other amenities that I desire in a vehicle especially for long trips with the RV attached The drivers seat with lumbar and 6 way motorized adjustment gives me an ability to move the seat into almost any position I want My brother has the same model amp year pickup and hates the feel he gets out of his seat he says he always ends up with a back ache out of it so I have run into mixed opinions on this feature It is a F 250 XLT model Supercab with and automatic and 4 wheel drive I have owned it for a year and the following sums up my experience with the vehicle MECHANICAL ATTRIBUTES rating 8 out of 10 The Power Stroke has proven to be a real reliable engine with lots of low end torque while at the same time providing a fair amount of top end cruising ability I pull a 35 foot fifth wheel trailer and have been able to climb a 4 to 5 grade and still maintain 50 miles per hour with the trailer attached The front passengers seat tilts forward and rolls full forward all with one release lever which allows extremely easy access to the rear seat Speaking of the rear seat I have found it very stiff and uncomfortable although my kids and other passengers have not not_complained not_I not_used not_to not_have not_a not_96 not_GMC not_3 not_4 not_ton not_Sierra not_extended not_cab and I found the rear seat in it to be much more comfortable however SUSPENSION AND RIDE rating 9 out of 10 This is a truck and it rides as such and so I dont not_expect not_anything not_different not_out not_of not_it not_For not_the not_most not_part not_you not_do not_feel not_the not_bumps not_in not_the not_road but it is smooth and comfortable and so not not_unpleasant not_of not_a not_ride
Pos,It handles like a smaller car in many ways including cornering The notable comfort deterioration that has occurred is in various electrical system failures Neither the dealer nor Ford has taken an acceptable level of responsibility for repairing electrical defects I purchased my 1995 Ford Explorer Eddie Bauer Edition new it was a dealer demo in 1995 after shopping and comparing nearly every competing SUV The Explorer was the most comfortable of all comparable SUVs at that time and five years later has lost very little of its comfort for driver or passengers It has served its purpose quite well for me My primary consideration was comfort for driver and all passengers with transportation reliability being a high priority as well It is well suited for family trips Overall this was an expensive car to purchase is expensive to fuel and at a nuisance level has been expensive to keep functioning electrically It does burn a lot of gas averaging about 14 miles per gallon with a mix of city and highway driving The Explorer is not not_designed not_for not_hauling not_large not_loads but can fit a surprising amount of bulk if necessary Although the sound system has been repaired 5 times at no cost other failures such as heat AC fan speed adjustability and wiper timing adjustability were not not_warranted not_The not_Explorer not_has not_provided not_100 not_reliable not_transportation not_having not_never not_required not_any not_functional not_service not_other not_than not_for not_normal not_maintenance
Pos,This is for both front seats On the outside this truck is a winner Its tall heavy and has a sporty look So I had to go to an auction to get me one The instrument cluster seems somewhat not not_so not_luxury but it gets the job done To small glove box for my taste tho Seats are the bomb confortable soft and lumbar support It has the 4 0 CID engine Mine was 6 cylinder but theres a 8 cylinder model too This baby came along Eddie Bauer loaded 4X4 control track Man my first SUV and I had a winner HEres my opinion i Exterior The previous owner did a terrific job taking care of it i Interior Leather baby all leather all over front and rear seats central and side arm rests The millage on this baby was kinda high 170 K miles but if you could only hear her its like the day it rolled off the assy ine Otherwise you will get yourself a kidney milkshake Only Motorcraft plugs are recommended for Ford engines I hope this review has helped you and please rate it Hi I was out in the market and I came accros with the idea of purchasing a SUV I found none that would fit my pocket The side moldings and trim add a lot of personality to it Big all aroung glass allows you to see all over the place Keyless entry and alarma integrated Roof rack and a hitch ball come to make everything more appealing Wheels and Tires 225 75 16 and beautiful 16 3 spoke chome wheels i Engine On the back theres space for that trip or the groceries A convenient jack storage space and 4 frame bolted hooks so you can strap that baby seat or a flat tire i Extras 6 CD changer and premium sound kicks it subwoofer integrated Automatic antenna Rear wiper and squirter Premium carpet job Rear seat radio and AC controls Automatic climate control Power windows and locks Cargo Cover off ebay 4 x 4 BABY ALL THE WAY i Inconveniences so far AC unit on all explorers had a failure called blend door actuator Mine has it It wont let you mix the temp for the air its either all cold or all hot Change the shocks for a model that allows you a softer ride
Pos,Purchased a new 1997 E 150 conversion van Oh and we just replaced the tires Have never used the plug in block heater One of the best vehicles we ve ever owned The rear bench folds down into a bed thats both comfortable and easy to operate The separate reading lights allow the kids to read or play games at night without distracting the driver The captains chairs are very comfortable and can be adjusted to just about any position one could want The van is extremely roomy and cost less than any of the minivans we looked at All in all a superior value for the money On other than level roads though the transmission shifts frequently when the cruise control is on and the speed is over 65 But on level roads it works just fine The noise level is very low We had the cold weather package added even though we bought it in El Paso TX The extra insulation sprayed on the bottom insulates the sound too Not bad for a vehicle thats driven across the US three times and made innumerable road trips with a family of 5 all the boys have their own seat no one touches anyone else The van now has about 50 000 miles on it The only repairs have been a new starter 160 and a front brake job 400 Both were done by a Ford dealer so im sure better prices could be had elsewhere We had a Rear A C installed not not_a not_separate not_compressor not_but not_a not_separate not_coil not_and not_blower not_Works not_extremely not_well not_best not_75 not_we not_ve not_ever not_spent not_Opted not_for not_the not_6 not_cylinder not_like not_the not_mileage not_we not_get not_up not_to not_22 not_hwy not_miles and it holds highway cruising speed quite well
Pos,The Bronco II is an awesome vehicle It also has a pretty hefty 23 gallon gas tank Most vehicles this size have no bigger than a 19 gal tank The only major problems ive had are ones ive caused I crushed the muffler 4 wheeling punctured the gas tank 4 wheeling and then the leaf spring sag and minor things to be expected with age The B2 has outlasted my brothers 94 Jeep and his Saab 900 Ford makes great vehicles Its got 194 000 miles and my broncos still running strong Its a pity that they quit making the B2 in 1990 I wish they still made em I love my Bronco II The leaf springs on Bronco IIs tend to wear out after a while causing rear end sag but just a little Nothing a leaf spring helper wont fix ive also seen 4 Runners with the same problem Leaf springs are relatively inexpensive anyway probably 150 180 for a full set unless you get lifted springs It can out maneuver any 4WD out there except maybe the classic Bronco has good power its comfortable strong axles and manual transmission 5spd is the only way to go rides great etc I cant not_say not_enough not_good not_things not_about not_my not_1990 not_Bronco not_II not_XLT not_ive not_had not_it not_almost not_2 not_years not_and not_enjoyed not_every not_bit not_of not_it not_This not_thing not_is not_awesome not_Its not_very not_versatile not_and not_rugged and you can do just about anything with it check out bronco2 com and jamesduff com I get great gas mileage for an older vehicle
Pos,You dont not_hear not_much not_road not_noise I just recently bought a ford escort because of the style of the car This ford escort is really good on gas I recently took the car on a short road trip This is a new type of car for my family I think the car its self is roomy and smooth riding The only problem I had with it so far is that the radio volume will get louder then it wll go real low Any one who is looking for a good dependable car should look into getting one except those with to small kids wish are in car seats
Pos,It gets you where you need to go And this car has so much character You will not not_find not_a not_car not_with not_more not_character not_than not_an not_Escort not_I not_promise not_you not_that 95 of my Escort experience has been extremely positive I own a red 1990 Ford Escort LX four door hatchback to be precise Id have to get all technical about under the hood stuff that I dont not_know not_a not_whole not_lot not_about not_and not_alls not_good not_there not_All not_in not_all not_a not_great not_little not_car It fights a little going up hill but any four banger is going to do that The biggest problem I have with my Escort is that it doesnt always start this doesnt happen as often to me as it does to my cousin who has 1989 Ford Escort LX but my uncle and grandfather devised a way to start them with a screwdriver We only paid 200 because my dad knew the guy he bought it from my Escort is easily worth 700 800 I love my Escort with these gas prices a car that gets 30 to 33 miles per gallon is always good and you can take them anywhere interstate city dirt roads etc I take my escort up over the mountain and down a dirt road a couple times each week when I go to work the gelding im showing in 4 H this year and it does fine
Pos,My wife and I love the fan The 7 passenger seating is great it allows us to separate the girls so they won t fight on long trips We highly recommend this van Anyone with a large family would benefit from this van ps this van has 230 000 kilometers on it and it still purrs like a kitten has the pickup of a new van The seven passenger van was just the ticket for us We purchased a 91 used in March 2000 and so far no major problems save for having to replace the sliding door track at a cost of 200 00 including labour My present car passed away one night on the way to work and my wife and I needed a another car van to replace it I was always interested in the Aerostar as our friends have them With 11 year old triplets we needed a van to hold all of us
Pos,There are however some sacrifices made when purchasing a light truck The truck rides very well smoother than small trucks ive driven in the past It has 65 000 miles on it now and I havent had a single repair The XLT package with sport wheels dress it up nicely I have been more than pleased with my Ranger The room in the cab is tight and unless you have a camper shell shopping can be a problem My only regret is that did not not_invest not_in not_the not_extended not_cab not_model not_Overall not_I not_give not_my not_Ranger not_an not_excellent not_rating not_I not_would not_highly not_recommend not_a not_Ranger not_to not_anyone not_considering not_the not_purchase not_of not_a not_small not_pick not_up The 2 3 liter engine with the five speed manual transmission is sporty and fun to drive I was originally worried that it would be under powered but for light hauling and in most driving conditions the engine is more than adequate I purchased my Ranger new in March of 1996 I purchased it because I needed a truck to use while remodeling a home but I wanted a vehicle that would be small enough to commute to work I picked the Ranger over the other small trucks out there for a couple of reasons First and foremost the Ranger was rated at or near the top in most of the ratings categories in Consumer Reports Second in its price range I felt that the Ranger offered more in terms of styling and options
Pos,If anyone has any advice any problems with 4 0 or questions please e mail me at cornfed 621 aol net I will gladly answer any questions reguarding the 4 0 ranger any advice would be greatly appreciated I was in the market for a small truck I looked around and I found that the ranger offered the most for your money although I later found that the resale on these trucks drop very quikly For less then I could have bought a toyota standard cab with a 4 cylinder I got a super cab ranger with a 4 0 V6 with a 5 speed trans and power mirrors I have put 62 000 miles on it with no problems what so ever the gas milage isnt not_the not_greatest but its worth it the 4 0 has more than enough power and tows my 19 ski boat with little effort I was really impressed when I hooked up my boat to see how it tows I drove it from L A to NewYork to Maine and back to L A with no trouble what so ever I recently installed a vortech super charger with 5 pounds of boost and the truck just screams very very reliable
Pos,We bought it two weeks later p We took it for a test drive and fell in love immediately When the weather gets nasty our model came with the optional hard top The overall look and feel of the Thunderbird can be summed up in one word Style My wife and I set out to try every convertible on the market The range went from the tiny Toyota MR2 with absolutely no storage space to the Chrysler Sebring convertible This car is a definite head turner be it a weekend driver or a daily commuter We were ready to settle for the Chrysler when we spotted the Thunderbird in a Ford specialty showroom The retro stylings take you back to the original Thunderbird in most every detail Even the rag top has its original roots With the top down the noise level is acceptable Raising the windows brings noise down to soft conversation levels We are still getting used to this feature but I can say that it does improve acceleration p The auto manual shifter is selected by pushing the shifter to the right then selecting up or down a gear manually without using a clutch It was well above the price range we were shopping in 42 k list but in the end that didnt not_matter The 2003 Thunderbird has two options that earlier models did not not_280 not_horsepower and an auto manual shifter Since the car weighs close to 4000 lbs the additional horsepower was a welcome addition It now runs 0 60 in a respectable 6 8 seconds Keep in mind this is not not_designed not_as not_a not_sports not_car not_so not_acceleration not_in not_that not_range not_is not_admirable Heated seats dual climate control 6 disc CD changer dash ignition key steering wheel mounted radio controls power mirrors cup holders and cigarette lighter adapters round out the dash Power seats make driver swaps a breeze p We only have 1500 miles on the car so far the engine wont really be broken in until 3500 miles or so I have to give Ford credit for building a high quality product with little competition Rather than take the car to a fully automatic top as was done in the Volvo C70 another Ford they left a simple manual latch in the center of the top with an automatic open close button easy to reach on the dash The real fun for this car is a good twisty road Rear wheel drive combined with good weight distribution and lots of it make for a very fun drive Brakes are extremely competent especially given the weight of the vehicle Testing panic stops left me very happy with the cars safety systems This includes both wind and engine noise I cant not_believe not_how not_quiet not_the not_engine not_is not_while not_cruising not_Put not_your not_foot not_in not_the not_floor and it will audibly remind you of the v8 heritage under the hood Speaking of the windows each time you open the doors the window automatically drops a quarter inch to release from the rag top This top snaps easily into place but be sure to have two strong adults to remove it It weighs a solid 85 lbs and is fairly awkward Fortunately it also came with a stand for garage storage of the top during the fair weather months p Inside the cabin you will find tastefully detailed leather seats with wood and stainless appointments The window automagically creates a tight seal when you close the door again Inserting the key in the ignition prompts the power tilting steering wheel to return to its previous position in front of you One turn of the key and you wonder why you didnt not_just not_sleep not_in not_that not_comfortable not_drivers not_seat not_Unfortunately not_the not_trunk not_only not_has not_space not_for not_a not_couple not_of not_small not_suitcases not_or not_a not_large not_garment not_bag not_This not_would not_not not_be not_a not_good not_car not_to not_take not_on not_a not_two not_week not_tour not_of not_the not_country not_p not_Gas not_mileage not_has not_been not_fairly not_consistent not_running not_18 not_city not_and not_23 not_highway
Pos,This is my third over the past fourteen years This is the first that ever had a glitch I just turned over 30 000 miles on my 1998 Ford Ranger four door XLT 4x4 The door ajar light stays light and occasionally the dome light stays on by itself The rear transaxel clanks once for each of the first two gears when accelerating from a stop The dome light is always on for the first few tire revolutions I havent counted the actual number but about twenty feet worth Of course the original tires were Firestone Recall brand I was lucky enough to have my blow out just before the story hit the media I paid six hundred plus for a set of Big O tires at less than twenty thousand miles At this time there is no known recourse for people like me who only got hurt in the wallet when their Firestones fell apart For the most part I love my truck Its got personality and a past Like most of my friends
Pos,My initial reaction when I saw the reveal of this car is wow The body roll is very minimal as the body feels more rigid than did my 2001 The front seats are VERY comfortable for a sports coupe strongly bolstered yet still supportive and soft The second run etched an image of the car driving around on tires lined with double sticky tape The spoiler is now more integrated into the body reminiscent of the spoilers on the BMW M series cars The engine has been modified from its aluminum block cousin that was in the 1999 and 2001 cobra The new engine block is cast iron to increase strength for the added stress created by the supercharger This cobra is the second of this particular breed that ive owned the first being a 2001 Cobra Convertible The drivers seat is power with adjustments to the height angle pitch side bolster rear end bolster lumbar support etc It was when I decided to put my foot into the floorboard that the car underwent a metamorphosis The rear of the 03 is very different with a much cleaner look than its predecessors and its own siblings in the Mustang corral The steering is firm and responsive as is the clutch shifting engagement though the shifter can be a bit quirky at times As I pulled out into the highway I noticed how mild mannered this supercar seemed to be as I drove it into afternoon traffic One can only wait in stitches to see what kind of work of art the guys at Fords Special Vehicles Team will produce on that platform This car could very easily be slated into a comparison with Clark Kent Superman With a light foot on the throttle its not not_jerky not_or not_hard to control in the least The Mustang platform is going to be retired for the 2005 model year in favor of a modified version of the Jaguar X type and Lincoln LS platform code named DEW lite The hood has been modified from the previous hood both to add room for the blower and with the addition of finally functional hood vents to vent hot air from the engine compartment The 2003 holds the title of being the most powerful 5 more advertised horsepower than the 2000 Cobra R Mustang to roll out of the Ford plant and it carries the honor with flying colors Ok now I dont not_just not_THINK not_the not_car not_is not_fast not_I not_KNOW not_it not_is not_Lateral not_acceleration not_however not_is not_just not_one not_part not_of not_the not_equation not_that not_makes not_a not_great not_sports not_car The road is a blast for a driving enthusiast two 90 degree curves and soft slopes that turn halfway down a hill etc I made one run at a normal pace just to get a feel for the car As you sit down inside the car you noticed the snake badged two tone leather suede seats the electroluminescent instrument cluster Mach 460 6 disc in dash CD player and the coveted 6 speed Tremec T 56 6 speed manual transmission shared by the Cobras arch nemesis the Dodge Viper The front fascia has been modified with more open areas to allow cool air to pass into the engine compartment to facilitate better engine cooling and venting of the massive front disc brakes Along side the vehicle Ford has changed the rocker panel trim slightly and the side scoops unfortunately not not_functional have been modified from the 1999 2001 run The compression ratio has also been reduced again to accommodate the forced induction After the typical male rush of testosterone not not_a not_sexist not_comment not_have not_seen not_plenty not_of not_ladies not_sporting not_Cobras not_as not_well not_as not_gentlemen not_I not_closed not_the not_hood not_and

firm stomp on the brakes brought the massive 13 inch front Brembo rotors to life and as expected in true Cobra fashion the car stopped on a dime and handed over 9 and 1 2 cents change The clutch does take some getting used to as one person that I let drive the car put it you ll have the legs of a linebacker after driving this thing every day All in all one couldn 146t ask for a better balance of ride quality and handling ability in a better package The ABS system on the car is very advanced and even in panic braking in wet conditions the car comes to a very confident stop I have yet to experience it in snowy weather but I am hoping that this car will have to experience very little of it with me residing in Georgia Ok that 146s two parts of the equation passed with flying colors it can accelerate like a tomahawk missile and stop like it had reverse thrusters but can it handle anything less inviting than Interstate 75 I took the car to the road that my house is off of in rural Paulding County Georgia The tunnel like large tail pipes make themselves very visible as does the Badging naming this Mustang the head of the SVT pack Minor tweaks such as spoilers on the windshield wipers making them functional up to a frightening 130 miles per hour body color keyed break away mirrors and the restyled fascia set this snake apart from the others in the SVT cobra den This car is glued to the road Pushing it near its limits will illicit a bit of a happy rear end in hard cornering which is to be expected and is welcomed as long as the driver is as capable about handling it as the car is doing it The handling is brilliant with many welcome tweaks to the suspension in 2003 The base price tag on the Z06 is in the neighborhood of 51 000 For comparisons sake a 1300 dollar investment into modifications will put the Cobra to a performance level of 500 Rear Wheel Horsepower not not_that not_this not_author not_would not_every not_encourage not_the not_modification not_of

not_it not_dramatically Now that I had investigated all that I could about the car with it motionless it was time to wake the beast up for a little stretching of the legs Immediately upon ignition the car makes its intentions known with that typical American V8 burble turning every head within 300 feet After playing with the shifter I decided it was time to set out on this little adventure That basically sums up each of the individual parts that are required to make up a good sports car Tallying all of the scores the Cobra is simple an achievement on the part of the Ford Special Vehicles Team The Cobra unfortunately lost its competition from GM this year with their F body cars no longer being produced after 2003 Authors note the 2003 Cobra is faster than any F body GM offered in 2002 snicker On the open highway the ride is as nice as to be expected in a car with the handling capabilities of this vehicle if you want a smooth ride opt for the same base engine in the Mercury Marauder this is after all a supercar Wet traction is also above average with help of the cars Goodyear Eagle F1 tires and the standard traction control I do at times find it easier just to reach down into the endless pool of torque and start out lazily in second gear in heavy rain to eliminate any rear wheel slippage The backseat is small as is to be expected in this breed of car most cars that can compete from a performance standpoint don 146t even HAVE a backseat so my theory is be glad I have one at all Popping the hood of the vehicle reveals a beautifully trimmed 32 valve Dual OverHead Cam 4 6 litre 281 ci American V8 A small metal plate will grab the eye of anyone looking at an SVT engine for the first time as each engine is hand signed engraved by the two man team that built them Mounted proudly atop the large American V8 is an Eaton Roots type supercharger capable of 8 pounds of boost from the factory The statistics alone are mind boggling for any car 390 Horsepower underrated by Ford intentionally realistic figures are somewhere around 381 at the rear wheels and 415 25 at the flywheel 390 foot pounds of torque 0 60 in 4 5 seconds 1 4 mile time between 12 5 and 12 9 all OUT OF THE BOX Finally an auto maker took the drawing board out of the engineering room in the basement and took it out the enthusiasts that are actually buying and driving the car and said OK guys what should we do next From the beginning you go in knowing that you re getting a frighteningly fast car but the deal just keeps getting better The Boost needle went full tilt to 8 PSI the tachometer started its screaming climb to 6500 RPMs and I was firmly planted goofy grin and all to the back of my seat WOW As I shifted into second at about 6000 RPMs the whole cataclysmic process repeated itself Approaching 6300 RPMs this time I noticed OH MY GOD I am in second gear going 73 miles an hour in just a bit shy of 6 seconds Deciding that I wanted to keep my privilege to drive I was in a 55 zone I backed off the accelerator and shifted into third giving my internal organs a moment to catch up to my body I got on the interstate and repeated the jet like acceleration up to about 100 MPH and back down The price on this car at its release was 34 750 though many dealers across the country are price gouging it anywhere from 1000 dollars over sticker to 10 000 in areas where the car is hard to get I absolutely refused to pay a dime over sticker and finally found an honest dealership here in Atlanta that was selling the car for the same sticker it got onto their lot with The price tag on this car is a true steal considering the next rival to this car is the Corvette Z06 the two vehicles are truly not not_in not_the not_same not_class not_but not_as not_the not_2003 not_Cobra

Pos,I bought my 1995 4 door hatchback Aspire used from my neighbor It had 70 000 miles on it and I paid 2 000 for it I just love this little car My boyfriend is tall and was very surprised about how much leg room he has in it I get excellent gas mileage 40 mpg Its air conditioner has a hard time while driving in town and sitting in traffic but works fine when on the open road It will go fast speeds 85 if you are in a hurry but does tend to start vibrating at 70 Excellent for shopping trips fits well into tight parking places and has plenty of cargo space I drive this more than my new 4 wheel drive Ford Ranger I really enjoy owning this little car
Pos,It is fully carpeted too It has several where the heck is that coming from rattles buzzes and clunks The brake rotors are warped now I am sure turning them will help at least for a little while The shifter is rubbery but if you are gentle with it it will slip right into and out of gear It used to vibrate at higher speeds because the tires were a cheap off brand Michelin Weatherhandlers fixed that problem This particular Aspire having been previously wrecked probably will not not_last not_much not_longer but for right now it is doing me just fine as a courier delivery vehicle There is plenty of room for cargo and the rear seat not not_only folds down but flips up against the front seats to provide a flat cargo floor This car always starts right up and runs smoothly does not not_smoke not_or not_knock and has enough power for me Some people might say this car is underpowered I own a 1995 Ford Aspire base model 2 door hatchback with air cassette and the standard transmission I purchased it recently for a very low price because it had been previously wrecked This car is however in excellent condition for a 5 year old mini with 75 000 miles I ll be honest most people would probably hate this as a used car The only major problem I foresee with this car is the clutch it is slipping slightly when I drive harder but if I take it easy it shifts and engages fine The rougher you treat it the tougher it is to get it to shift I would say this car is not not_the not_best not_for not_long not_trips not_I not_have not_a not_Buick not_Century not_for not_those But to do the basic point A to to C to D of courier work this car is okay I used to own a Geo Metro and this car is a welcome change not not_necessarily better but it is different For these folks do not not_worry not_Most not_1 not_6 not_and not_1 not_8 not_liter not_Mazda not_engines not_will not_bolt not_in not_with not_little not_modification not_as not_will not_the not_better not_geared not_Mazda not_transmissions not_I not_have not_been not_averaging not_an not_honest not_35 not_mpg not_with not_this not_car not_under not_hard not_driving not_in not_Dallas not_Texas not_with not_the not_AC not_running not_about not_75 not_of not_the not_time not_Having not_no not_power not_steering not_is not_only not_a not_chore not_during not_parallel not_parking not_which not_I not_have not_to not_do not_little not_of not_because not_most not_of not_my not_deliveries not_go not_to not_businesses not_I not_have not_learned not_that not_keeping not_the not_tires not_inflated not_properly not_will not_keep not_the not_steering not_light not_above not_a not_crawling not_speed
Pos,The bench seat does not not_give not_enough not_back not_support Most materials of are very high quality You get a sinking feeling when you sit down The chrome wheels and bumpers along with the two tone paint really accent the exterior The speakers work well and surround the whole truck cab with your choice of music In June of 1998 a 1996 Ford F 150 XL was given to our family as a company vehicle You could steer this truck with your index finger Surprisingly this truck is a blast to drive You can throw the F 150 any curve and it inspires confidence every time Reliability is not not_a not_problem The only problems ive had with it so far is a broken drivers door lock a cassette stuck in the cassette player and a minor transmission repair The box is huge and can handle most loads but the tailgate is too high and rather heavy Loading the box requires 2 people The paint is average but there are swirl marks all over after washing and the alloy wheels where equipped corrode quickly so one must keep them clean The 4 speed automatic with overdrive transmission robs the engine of much needed power and shifts roughly However it handles curves responsively and with confidence and parking is not not_a not_problem The air conditioner keeps you ice cold in the hottest weather and in the dead of winter the cab is red hot in only a matter of minutes Outside the whole truck looks great It was grey green two tone with grey cloth interior and automatic transmission Inside the truck is a well designed and easy to use dash Most knobs and dials are easy to find and fit well in your hands However the radio controls are awful the buttons are too close together and you have to take your eyes off the road just to turn it on However the radio and cassette player put out amazing sound quality If you are looking for a truck to do basic hauling moving or just to run back and forth to the store then the F 150 is the truck for you Its tough reliable and fun to drive Its a combination truck family sedan and its one great buy The ride is bone jarring You feel almost every vibration the road can throw at you There is little wind and road noise though The V6 engine provides ample power and torque but you get the feeling you re driving a family sedan instead of a pickup
Pos,The engine runs flawlessly in stop and go driving with heavy loads in the Arizona heat of 100 110 degrees and is pleasant to drive I must say I am very pleased with this vehicle it has made me a ton of money and still looks and runs like new Bought truck brand new September 1996 XL Shortbed 4 9 engine 5 speed with 3 55 rear end has 100 000 miles I bought this truck for use in my landscape buisness it has never been driven without a trailer in tow usually about 3 000 lbs Still has original clutch amazing has only gone through one set of front brake pads I had a problem with a leaky smog tube which was misdiagnosed and ended up costing over 1200 and have replaced both fuel pumps and had the fuel system cleaned out at a cost of 1400 however this may have been caused by running the tanks low to avoid gas stops I live in the Arizona desert and the truck is parked outside so I am very impressed that the finish still looks like new as does the interior this vehicle is very sun resistant
Pos,Why Ford Focus We found ourselves more relaxed after longer drives We have been driving a leased 2003 Ford Focus auto sedan for about 6 months now in Australia Driving Experience Also the indicator noise is incredibly loud its unbelievable that the designers included such an annoying noise in their design The door lock and boot lock remote is something we love Plenty of space in the boot The stereo controls on the steering wheel are so close to the actual stereo controls its of no benefit to have a second set We have certainly enjoyed the improvement in our driving experience as compared with our previous 7 year old small car Daewoo Cielo Much quieter smoother more powerful Of the choices available to us through our leasing program the Ford Focus was simply the cheapest model with the required safety features twin airbags anti lock braking system The features that we like are this cars comfort handling and performance Its got high headroom which is a big plus From that perspective we are very happy with this car Features and Options Some of the features are annoying particularly that the indicator controls are on the wrong side of the steering wheel The options that we got were roof rack we removed this immediately the noise on the highway was shocking scuff plates yes we like them passenger seat bag too big gets in the way boot liner excellent for cleaning up spills and boot carrier net saves the shopping from rolling around In fact the track radio station control on the steering wheel is not not_intuitive and I have to work it out every time I use it ive stopped using it now A common problem with the Ford Focus is that the fuel gauge fails during the first two months this happened on our car and on several others that we know of A further issue is that the cigarette lighter does not not_seem not_compatible not_with not_our not_phone not_charger not_the not_same not_charger not_works not_in not_a not_number not_of not_other not_cars not_that not_we not_have not_used not_Finally not_the not_air not_intake not_defaults not_to not_open not_every not_time not_that not_the not_car not_starts not_so not_closing not_it not_in not_traffic not_becomes not_a not_regular not_chore not_for not_us not_So not_much not_for not_the not_negatives
Pos,The suspension in the Cobra R is rock solid The ride was slightly rough but I could care less This and my love for this car is why I am writing this epinion The car has side exiting exhaust tips directly in front of the rear wheels To say the least the year 2000 was an interesting year for Fords Special Vehicle Team SVT This automobile also comes with a new 6 speed manual transmission as opposed to the standard 5 speed which comes with most Cobra vehicles Suspension The Cobra R is a pure muscle car which is probably owned by people who have money to burn This huge piece of equipment forced the redesign of the hood of the car just to fit this bad boy in the front of the car When he hit the gas I was awestruck with the power of the engine I literally was pinned to my seat If you feel I deserve an NR for not not_driving not_this not_car not_then not_that not_I not_will not_accept not_it not_Thanks not_hope not_you not_enjoy not_the not_review One thing is for certain if I had the money I would definitely do what I could to get my hands on the 2000 SVT Cobra R With delays on the production of the 2000 Mustang Cobra because power outputs were lower than listed SVT produced a limited edition of the 2000 Cobra which was given the glamorous name Cobra R This is good and also bad For track use which is basically what the Cobra R is intended for the Cobra R handles exceptionally however for road use the rock solid suspension creates a rough ride The Cobra R is truly an All American sports car Other notes about the Cobra R Most people who know some information on this vehicle know that this car comes without an air conditioner and a radio Due to the powerful engine and amazing aerodynamics of the Cobra R the top speed exceeds 170 MPH Exhaust on the Cobra R is also been modified greatly Because of rear suspension and fuel tank complications rear exiting exhaust pipes had to be voided The large bulge in the hood gives evidence to the size of this mammoth power house Intake and exhaust ports were redesigned by SVT to improve the air flow for the car Despite the rather heavy weight of this car the 385 horses under the hood make this car zoom 0 60 in about 4 7 seconds and 0 100 in about 10 9 seconds When he started up the car I was amazing at the ear pleasing sound which resonated from the exhaust pipes I have always thought that Mustangs have great sounding engines but all I can say about the Cobra R exhaust tone is Wow Although we only were in the car for a minute or two it was amazing Note I have not not_driven not_the not_2000 not_Cobra not_R not_Many not_people not_have not_criticized not_me not_and not_given not_me not_NR not_ratings not_for not_lack not_of not_personal not_experience not_I not_have not_ridden not_in not_this not_car and since there are only 300 of these cars in production I feel my personal experience will suffice I have a vast knowledge of this vehicle due to research The car is strictly a racing vehicle not not_for not_every not_day not_driving not_Because not_of not_the not_rarity not_of not_this not_car not_prices not_have not_gone not_over not_70 not_000 not_the not_Cobra not_R not_I not_rode not_in went for 74 000 SVT Ford has created a legendary special edition of a classic car The Cobra R is truly an amazing vehicle that I would love to even be able to see another one in person again The most powerful Mustang automobile ever produced the Cobra R brings awesome power and mean looks to the road Because of limited production of the vehicle only 300 were made the prices have boomed past 50 000 Some people think it is crazy to pay such outrageous money for a Ford while others are willing to pay the premium to own such a majestic vehicle Performance The Cobra R packs a 5 4 DOHC V8 engine The Cobra R has a lowered ride height and 18 inch wheels wrapped in 265 40 ZR18 tires Exterior The Cobra Rs most noticeable features on the exterior are definitely the front racing air dam and the rear spoiler Both body pieces give the automobile a definitive look as well as the look of a mean racing machine The 300 Cobra Rs produced are all the trademark color of red When I first saw one of these cars at a fairly large Ford dealership where I live I was in awe There is a majestic aura about this car that is difficult to explain maybe its the fact that only 300 of these vehicles exist or maybe its the combination of beauty and power Being a huge Mustang fan I believe this car is stunningly beautiful I actually got my friend who works at the dealership to take a couple pictures of me and the Cobra R Personal Experience with the Cobra R I have a friend who works at the SVT licensed Ford Dealership in my town I convinced him to let me come in and ride with him in the Cobra R he wouldnt not_let not_me not_drive not_it not_Being not_a not_huge not_fan and having read every known article on the Cobra R I took this opportunity without a second thought
Pos,We have grandkids The CD player has great sound This has been such a convenience That is perfect for long trips It also has beautiful very comfortable leather seats It also performs various system checks at my request It has a very smooth ride and handles well The sound system is great and has the optional 6 CD player Both the driver and passenger seat comes equipped with this option No more arguments with my husband you moved my seat Power seats driver and passenger You can even let them hookup headphones in the rear The rear heat and air controls have been very convenient for transporting passengers As a happy 3 time Explorer owner I highly the Explorer Limited 2000 It allows them to control the blower and keeps them comfortable We ve hauled a lot of stuff in it especially right before Christmas It also holds lots of suitcases golf clubs and or dive gear when needed You can move seats forward backward up down theres also the ability to tilt slightly forward or backward It was a bit interesting on the drive home but we got it all in there The Explorer is just the right size for me and my husband and is comfortable for our occasional back seat passengers The console display gives me several options to view my gas consumption gallons used miles per gallon and gas remaining Two clicks on the remote lock assures me that all doors are shut and locked and the alarm is activated It really is the best of both worlds the comfort of a luxury car the cargo capabilities of a truck The speakers seem to be everywhere and you can easily adjust their performance to your taste Remote Lock Security alarm The owners may just hold onto this baby for a while Its the perfect luxury car that just thinks its a truck My husband is tall and I was constantly having to re adjust the seat when he would drive my previous Explorers Now we with just a click of the remote opener the seat is perfectly adjusted for me when I get in There is a 5 disc changer in the console as well as the ability to play a single disc in the slot in the dashboard Its easy to use just depress the button on the side of the seat and in a few minutes the leather seats are comfortably warm This would be great if I was hauling older kids in the back Some of my favorite options Memory seats only available on the Limited We ve had snow and ice a couple of times recently very unusual for Memphis and these seats have kept me toasty warm Convenient Rear Controls We bought our first Explorer in 1996 I have to admit I was reluctant about driving a truck but was soon won over It is averaging about 19 miles to a gallon of gas I get rave reviews whenever anyone rides with me to lunch as well Thats always a nice plus The rear seats fold down for carrying larger items such playhouses and bicycles in the box I can also tell you we have hauled a new computer with 19 monitor big boxes and 8 foot step ladder at the same time One friend laughs that my husband and I have single handedly kept the economy going by our weekend shopping sprees Bonus Bun Warmers ive also discovered during the unusually cold weather we ve had in Memphis that the seat warmer is an absolutely wonderful option My husband wont let me call it a car I refuse to call it a truck and SUV is so well you know This Limited Explorer rides very comfortably on the road and it is great for driving around town It was almost as luxurious as any car Id owned and boy could I see better on the road I really enjoyed it and it was very reliable After a couple of years we traded it for a 1998 Eddie Bauer version Even more bells and whistles and again very reliable There have been a couple of times a door didnt not_shut not_well and I was alerted to by using this feature I love this car and think it would probably be a great buy when it starts showing up in the used car market if you ever find one At this point I knew I would never go back to a car again Recently we bought the 2000 Limited edition I absolutely love it It has power everything Probably more buttons than I ll ever be able to figure out but I will have fun trying My favorite new feature are the memory seats Theres plenty of room in the back to haul groceries or even sustain a massive shopping spree Trust me Update added January 7 2001 Having driven this Explorer for almost 8 000 miles and several months I am happy to report knock on wood that I have had absolutely no problems with it I very much love this vehicle The memory feature remembers how you like all these options Power windows standard on Limited and Eddie Bauer versions Windows can be locked and unlocked by the driver Dual controls on steering wheels its really nice to be able to adjust the temperature and fan as well as control the volume of the radio or cd without moving your hands from the steering wheel Power moon roof is nice on warm sunny days
Pos,The engine and the transmission are powerful and perform smoothly When I purchased my Explorer it had new General tires on it I like the feature content such as rear air and radio compass CD player and power equipment I also like the rear wiper washer the running boards and the fog lights The gas mileage isnt not_great but its an SUV and the mileage is just as good as that of my Jimmy was I know some people say Explorers arent stable even with tires other than Firestones but my Explorer seems very stable I bought this 2000 Explorer XLT as a replacement for my 1997 GMC Jimmy I wanted a new Explorer but my Jimmy was a piece of junk see review on it and I spent a lot of money and I had to buy what I could afford I purchased this Explorer at the local GMC dealership with 34 600 miles on it I have put about 1 000 miles on it so far and I have had nothing but good service
Pos,The E150 is a nice family van to go on long trips It is also nice to drive around except for the fact that it is about the size of a semi It gets bad gas mileage because our has a 5 8 liter engine but it has very good power for being as big as it is It is also very comfortable in the front and back and for kids can be very enjoyable since their is tv and vcr plus any game consoles they want If you live somewhere where it snows a lot this is not not_very not_good not_in not_the not_snow and I added a lot of weight in the back and it still wasnt The only thing I had a problem with was when I was getting off the freeway and I took the turn at 45 mph and the tire ripped off the axle causing it to break the running boards and me to do a 360 degree turn
Pos,The entire car would ve had to be re wired I purchased my Probe SE 5 speed used in 1998 with 53 000 miles This did not not_include not_labor not_so not_unless not_you not_want not_to not_put not_them not_in not_yourself not_these not_are not_costly Also the electric wiring shaft was severed causing the car to lose power while driving 70 mph on a curvy interstate Id recommend this vehicle for someone who performs regular maintenance on the Probe and loves to drive long distances The cost for the panels start at 2000 a piece to replace with upper cost of the door panel to 2700 these are after market value prices To replace an O2 sensor retail price from the dealership was 300 each and both need to be replaced when one goes out pricy 600 for a set of sensors Airflow sensor was 300 retail price from dealership as well Up until a few weeks ago she was going strong at 198 790 miles I drove her hard fast and rough Only had to replace the O2 sensors Airflow sensor and tires Great ride fun road tripping car and handled very well in all kinds of weather Only drawback was the price on replacement parts The design lacked in handling tire blowout I had to retire my baby after she was totaled beginning of this month I had Cooper Cobra tires on the car when the front drivers side tire split causing the entire front fender front quarter panel side panel undercarriage panel and door panel to become squashed as if Id run into a pole requiring complete replacement if Id decided to pursue restoration The damage was caused due to a poor design in handling tire split Granted sports cars are not not_meant not_to not_handle not_these not_situations not_beautifully but having made minor design changes could ve prevented some of these damages Overall ive never had such a great car run so well with so many miles im sure she would ve kept going for another good 40 000 miles easy All parts excepting for the sensors mentioned above and the tires were stock and still going strong
Pos,My favorite thing about this car is the spacious interior not not_for not_hauling not_people but things The hatchback with the removable cover and easy fold down backseat make it very easy to stick a lot in there In the city this is the perfect car becuase it runs smooth and is easy to drive Freeway driving on this car however isnt not_very not_fun So if you would like a cheap car that will last you forever is pretty dependable and nice for commuting this is a decent car for you The car starts to get a little shaky anywhere after 60 mph although 60 is where the car is happiest to sit and is very slow to accelerate I must give it credit though for maintaining speed smoothly There isnt not_a not_lot not_of not_room not_in not_this not_car not_either not_so not_I not_wouldnt not_reccomend not_it not_to not_a not_family not_of not_four not_or not_more not_however not_its not_just not_fine not_for not_a not_short not_ride not_Driving not_this not_car not_has not_always not_been not_enjoyed not_especially not_on not_day not_trips not_up not_to not_the not_ski not_resort They ride really well and are fun little cars to have My car may be no Audi but its mine and I love it The only thing ive done to my car was buy it a new stereo because ford factory radios arent worth a thing The only shame is sometimes going around the corners you slide a bit when its not expected the cars ride can trick you sometimes into thinking the car can do things it really cant not_Cheap not_cars not_when not_it not_comes not_to not_purchasing not_parts not_and not_gas The feature of being able to fold down one seat alone or the entire back bench has been very nice in many situations as well I drive up to Mt Baker Washington quite often to snowboard this car is perfect for an intensive hour long drive around fast corners with three friends for passengers and one seat folded down for the snowboards Purchased from City of Seattle in an auction for 2000 ive been the owner of my 1991 periwinkle blue Ford Escort LX for a little over a year now Receiving this car when I had first received my drivers license this car and I have been together through a lot Mainly driving the car to school and work the interior is quite nice and comfortable for myself although I wish the seats had more adjustment options because they can get to be quite stiff at times and arent very back friendly for anything more than a daytrip The only problem ive ever had with this car is the alternator and dont not_go not_to not_a not_ford not_dealer not_to not_have not_this not_one not_fixed and the pesky little check coolant light that mysteriously flashes on for a while randomly and randomly shuts off when the coolant is just fine Gotta love Ford If the car does break down however be glad its light Because this car is really easy to push out of intersections and very easy to tow with a tractor if need be I know this from personal experience and I was pretty glad
Pos,This was my very first car ever And my husband could not not_have not_chosen not_a not_better not_car We originally chose it because of the price There have been very little problems with this car Other than the air conditioning we never had any problems with the car The only recurring trouble that we have had to fix year after year is the air conditioning So considering the price and the mileage we have gotten out of it I think that the Ford Escort Wagon was a fantastic deal They told us a few years ago that it was a broken O ring they tried to give it a recharge of freon but it still never worked properly It was economical and good on gas and we were hoping to have a family at some time during the cars life so we chose the wagon Nine years four kids and 125 000 miles later the car is still taking care of us
Pos,This is the perfect car for a teenager It becomes a little jumpy and the steering loosens slightly The only problem I have noticed is when the car reaches 65 miles per hour on the interstate I have a 1991 Ford Escort LX im 16 years old and this is my first car I totally recommend this vehicle Throughout the time I have had it I havent had any major problems which is suprising considering the age of this car Its reliable and gets good gas mileage But my dad is basically a car expert and he believes this is nothing to worry about Buy this car you will be happy you did For parents it is a relief to know your child is protected and wont be broken down on the side of the road every other week Its an automatic and easy to drive and handle
Pos,The main fuse blew on several occasions The other problem with Escorts is the locks and alarm system It is caused by a faulty electrical part on either the drivers or passenger side door locks or both You would be looking at over 400 600 Each escort model has a different fuse box so finding the correct scrap one was hard This may not not_be not_too not_much but if you got the Ford dealer to do it for you it would cost 200 labour I love Escorts I think they re great I owned this European 1 6s model for about 6 months and had a few problems If they are very noisy and the car claims to have done 30 000 miles then it is more likely to be 130 000 The engine was the same model as the ones used previously in the 1984 91 model and so are not not_advanced and can be very noisy if worn Listen to the tappets It can be fixed but the parts will probably break again Check this if you are buying one and use it to knock the price down Also check ALL electrics You may never even experience any problems but be aware of them and carry spare main and regular fuses at all time Conclusion Popular car and good value for money Cheap spares availiable never go to the dealers Check the heater inside fan engine fan and electric windows and anything else you can think of I would not not_recommend not_buying not_a not_GHIA not_model not_or not_high not_spec not_model not_with not_a not_lot not_of not_electric not_parts not_as not_there not_is not_to not_much not_room not_for not_error The main problem in mine was the fuse box Its a really common problem and was why the escort was considered unreliable I know enough about cars to change it myself but it took a long time and a scrap box cost me 30 45 The barrels wear out very easily although if you know how to dismantle a door panel and remove the lock the dealer only charges a small amount to change the barrels for you The alarm is another problem on other European Fords as well If you lock the door from the passenger side and then unlock the door from the driver side the alarm will go off Other than this i found the car nice to look at nice do drive and the handling was good as well Seats were a little uncomfortable on long journeys though Mechanically they are actually very good and the engine problems that occured were purely electricaly related Check the exhaust for rust on the back box though as they do not not_last not_very not_long The noises can start from 60 000 miles onwards depending on use People try crafty methods such as using thick oil or if the oil is not not_clean then this will also dampen the noise find out what oil was used Dont be put off by this If the car is clean with a full history and is quiet ish then if the price is right buy it All electrical problems can be fixed very cheaply if you do it by yourself
Pos,The engine was fairly punchy for being only 88hp It had rust under the back wheel wells but I fixed it myself It keeps on asking for more punishment because we were both teenage first time drivers I owned a 91 Escort LX Wagon passed down from parent while first having gotten my license This car had a 136 000 miles on it when i received it and sold it to a friend with 139 000 miles The car is light enough for it The steering is a little sloppy but not not_bad I felt very secure in this car and always trusted the reliability While I will admit that the interior materials are cheap the stereo sucks and there were no power windows or locks I think that it was bought new for about 11 000 dollars so whats to be expected The paint had begun to faid as well it hadnt really been cared for before I got it Either way I think that it is a safe bet and a good easy car for first time drivers to learn on I drive a 95 Dodge Avenger now and probably would hate to go back to the less refined Escort read my gushing review of my Avenger love that car but I probably would get one real cheap if the Avenger was in an accident But that Escort is an amazing car
Pos,These features really give the Excursions interior a fantastic appearance The exterior body of the Excursion Limited is as attractive as the interior The transmission is a 4 speed automatic transmission with a shift on the fly 4X4 system This oversize SUV is really beautiful whether you look at its exterior or its interior The second row of seats can either be completely folded or folded in a 60 40 manner As for the front cabin the rear of the excursion will again offers lots of room The Ford Excursion Limited 2002 An Oversize Status Statement Looking at the Ford Excursion 2002 there is no doubt that it is a formidable machine The towing capacity is 11 000 pounds and the cargo space with all seats folded and third row removed is 146 cubic feet The top part will open upward as for most other SUV but the lower portion of the rear will split open in the middle As you probably noticed after reading this review is that I really do have mixed feeling about the 2002 Ford Excursion Limited It is a very beautiful truck actually I think that it is too nice to be used as a working vehicle The sound system an AM FM cassette single CD stereo is superb and it is only surpassed by the quality of the sound it emits The Limited Edition comes equipped with leather seats a 6 way captain style seat for the driver and rich looking wood grain trims on the interior door panels and also on the front console For the driver with the exception of the glove compartment which is to far on the passenger side all other gauges and controls are easy to see and reach The third row seats can also be folded and you will also have the option to remove it from the truck if you need to transport cargo Two words can describe the interior of the Ford Excursion Limited ROOMY and LUXURY Sitting behind the steering wheel of the Excursion you have the impression that you could park a second car inside But then it is also much too big to be used for city commuting I guess this leave that it is an expensive SUV TOY for those who have it all The color of the Excursion I test drove was Deep Blue with beige body side moldings and this made for a super color combination with the tan leather interior I really liked the tri panel rear door it sure makes it easy to load cargo and equipment in the Excursion The Excursion also comes equipped with a class IV load equalizing trailer hitch that will allow to safely pull a load of up to 11 000 pounds Driving the Excursion on the highway is a great experience but aside from driving it on the open road I do not not_believe not_it not_makes not_for not_great not_driving not_within not_city not_limit not_and not_for not_off not_roading It is a very comfortable truck to drive and it is dead quiet to me it is like a Lincoln on a truck frame A friend of mine who owns a marina uses his Excursion to pull boats around he told me that his old Suburban would do a much better job at pulling a loaded trailer than his new Excursion The 2002 Excursion Limited I drove was equipped with a V 10 powerful engine
Pos,Purely Physical Originally That is important especially with these gas prices The Ranger provides a smooth comfortable ride under normal weather conditions I fell in love with the looks of the truck The only car that gave me better fuel economy was an old VW Bug If you are looking for a truck with a lot of power this is not not_the not_one When I went to turn the key nothing That little trip to the dealership was 267 00 The side steps the sliding rear window the emerald green paint job the plush front seats the little cupholders and of course the awesome stereo system It really is annoying to be driving down the highway with inside lights that wont go off In the last year I have had to have the switches in both doors replaced that control the overhead lighting system The 4 cylinder engine would not not_be not_my not_choice not_next not_time not_around not_I not_hate not_when not_those not_big not_trucks not_pass not_me not_by not_on not_the not_onramps One day I just hopped in the truck and all my panel lights were on as well as the radio but there was no key in the ignition The Ranger has been a decent vehicle mechanically until this last year but I will get into that later Besides the physical appeal the truck is incredibly economical to drive This was a freebie because the dealership said there was a recall I also had to have the accuator switch on the ignition replaced just recently The Ranger is priced right with a lot of features for the buck but whether you like the truck or not not_is not_going not_to not_depend not_on not_your not_ability not_to not_deal not_with not_the not_downfalls The bed of the truck is capable of hauling small lightweight loads I like it because not not_that not_many not_people not_ask not_me not_to not_help not_them not_move not_since not_the not_capacity not_of not_the not_bed not_is not_limited However I have had several problems with slipping in the rain and snow even on the lightest of days I weighted the truck down last winter with 25 lbs of sand and still had trouble on snowy days Bad News Of course my warranty ran out about 3 months ago Now the check engine light has decided to come on and continues to shine brightly even though I have had everything checked out Who knows why Overall Rating Overall I would say that this really has been a good truck but I do plan on going with a larger version next time with more power
Pos,Even that is debatable They re not not_for not_everybody What sucks about your Ranger The thing didnt not_come not_with not_a not_cup not_holder The truck gets better gas mileage when the hubs are unlocked The problem is that there isnt not_a not_hotter not_looking not_color not_for not_a not_truck not_than not_black My truck has locking hubs and a shifter on the floor to engage the four wheel drive The aluminum alloy wheel are stylin and non corrosive so they should stay shiny forever This is a really nice system as I only lock the hubs between November and April snow season While the regular cab is small I have no problem taking the truck on long trips So whats so great about your Ranger Well the stick shift V6 is smooth as silk The seats are the most comfortable of any of the trucks I tested Dodge Chevy Toyota If they re for you I would definitely recommend buying a truck in the Ford Ranger series The only advantage I can see to a step side is that it may have more stylish lines When I need the four wheel I just shift the extra shifter and its on even at full highway speed The price was right with new college grad discounts and rebate I only paid 15 000 for a brand new 4x4 set of wheels Now the alternative is the push button four wheel drive which is the equivalent of having the hubs locked at all times This means a little worse gas mileage but a little easier operation only having to push a single button whenever you want 4 wheel Ok I say that now and when I see another black beauty in the showroom I ll probably buy one again Oh yeah and it might be easier to climb up into the bed if you tend to need to get in there often 4x4 or 4x2 The Black paint for the reasons mentioned above All I can say is know what you re getting into before buying a small truck The Regular cab my next truck will have an extended cab or be one of those SUPs Sport Utility merged with a pickup so that ive got ample interior space and still have a bed for hauling dirty stuff im 6 4 and own a 97 Ranger XL Regular cab pickup I give the truck a rating of 5 stars because it is perfect for someone who wants what my particular truck has to offer As a matter of fact you might be able to get more stuff out of the weather in a Miata than in my regular cab Ranger I bought a truck box just to solve the problem of no interior space The extra ground clearance of a 4x4 while making the truck a little top heavy is a great when you want to clear the 3 foot snowdrift that the plow left for you at the end of your driveway Theres plenty of power there for all road conditions I cant

other small pick up Color My truck is gorgeous black with metallic gray trim and a gray interior I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER BLACK TRUCK AGAIN If you live in any location that has snow please do not

the Future Heaven forbid that you use your truck like a truck though Any little scratch shows I had a heart attack the first day I took my truck to the car wash only to see it come out with swirls where the dryers terry cloth towel had been You can imagine my dismay every time I haul mulch around or put bags of cement in the bed When clear coat gets scratched on a black paint job it shows up white Black also looks terrible when it gets salt on it from a the Northeastern roads I would say your best bet for truck colors is 1 silver 2 tan 3 white 4 red Cab Size Regular cab trucks have no benefit in riding convenience over a Mazda Miata At least the box gives me a place to put 1 or 2 bags of groceries Really though if you plan on hauling kids or even going on long trips either buy an extended cab or buy another vehicle A regular cab Ranger is only useful for around the town hauling and possibly longer trips with only 2 people Dont even think that you can fit a 3rd person in the middle seat especially with a stick shift Bed style ive got a fleet side long bed and I love it Fleet side trucks are the only ones that will fit 4x8 sheets of anything
Pos,I recently purchased a 1997 Ford Ranger XLT It is the 2 3 4 Cylinder engine with a 4 Speed Automatic The standard engine is peppy enough to not not_aggravate not_you and the interior feels very nice This truck feels solidly built the ergonomics are some of the best for a compact The ride is bouncy but its a truck so thats normal but it does handle good though This is the beginning of a beautiful relationship As of Mar 15 2002 my truck is still running strong no squeeks or rattles of any kind The only things that I dont not_like not_about not_it is that it has no tachometer and the speedlimit governer stops the party at 96 MPH when a lesser Toyota Tacoma tops at 105 MPH The stereo is the AM FM Cassette player and it sounds great for being stock the A C will either freeze you or toast you if you overdo it so needless to say it works good It is the single cab shortbed version Its Caymen Green with a prarie tan cloth interior First off this truck was a screaming deal it was very low mileage and the price was very nice and the dealership Hemborg Ford of Norco Ca is a very reputible and good dealership Otherwise im quite happy with it and when I get out of college and get a better paying job I ll get a brand new Ranger XLT or Edge with the 4 0 Liter V6 5 Speed Automatic Transmission 4 Wheel Drive CD Player Power Equipment Group Off Road Alloy Wheels and the 4 Door Supercab No mechanical problems save for a burnt out lightbulb that was easily replaced and a flat tire due to broken glass The Twin I Beam suspension is very competent off road as I found out in the Cajon Pass is So Cal for a 4 banger with an auto tran it hauls off road with only a touch of oversteer that is easily controled I was expecting poor braking performance due to the rear drums but I was pleasantly suprised about how good it stops
Pos,I bought Be forewarned please purchase the 4 wheel drive option My 1997 ranger not not_knowing not_a not_whole not_lot not_about not_trucks not_in not_general and was pleasantly surprised with the test drive The cold missouri winters arent a problem either the cab is usually too hot over a long period of time It handles and accelerates fine and is very handy when moving furniture and crates from place to place though im guilty of not not_getting not_regular not_oil not_changes not_I not_havent not_had not_any not_mechanical not_problems not_all not_of not_the not_instruments not_are not_easy not_to not_reach not_and not_operate and the air conditioner will freeze most anyone If the patches are unavoidable the only option is to get off of the gas pedal and ride out the turbulence this is a small problem at least for me because the bad roads are only in particular areas I cant not_fault not_Ford not_for not_Missouris not_bad not_highway not_maintenance not_so not_all not_in not_all not_im not_quite not_pleased not_with not_the not_Ranger If you live ANYWHERE where the roads tend to ice up kansas city YOU WILL need it I have to pile a minimum of five 35 lbs sandbags in the bed to have any traction at all this is my only regret and will buy another Ranger with that option when this one is paid for Another problem is portions of Missouri roads are horrific and I have potholes memorized for my route to from work due to the fact that I have nearly lost control after hitting uneven patches of highway in my ranger
Pos,The durability is tops The gas mileage is tops We have traveled numerous miles in this auto spending very little in fuel or maintenance Its economy features is astonishing Its rugged and durable Also cheapest tires on the market It has great pick up and go power I prefer the automatic over the standard any day however the standard shift has more go power as with any standard really We now own our third Ford Festiva Well actually the first one was a Fiesta the forerunner of the Festiva it still has the same features actually I am a happy camper here If you are looking for economy this is it If you are looking for luxury forget it This auto was popular for its economy not not_quality not_of not_ride not_I not_do not_not not_have not_a not_problem not_with not_its not_ride not_etc not_I not_have not_thoroughly not_enjoyed not_each not_one not_we not_have not_owned not_Bought not_all not_of not_them not_used not_Its not_sporty not_look not_and not_cuteness not_appeals not_to not_the not_young not_and not_old not_alike not_I not_realize not_some not_are not_eye not_soars not_as not_with not_any not_automobile not_and not_its not_savings not_appeals not_to not_all not_Its not_ease not_of not_parking not_is not_wonderful not_squeeze not_into not_those not_tight not_spots not_that not_others not_have not_to not_drive not_away not_from
Pos,But why give up a good thing Too much time and money at the gas station Oh and then there was that minor recall on the tires When I lived 30 miles from work 60 miles roundtrip this was a problem In the Sport the rear seat is not not_the not_easiest not_to not_get not_into and getting car seats in and out is time consuming The interior is attractive richer looking than other SUVs in my humble opinion and the body style still looks current despite Fords yearly body style updates on Explorers The mileage is not not_that not_great not_I not_would not_say not_I not_get not_on not_average not_15 not_16 not_MPG not_and not_I not_drive not_a not_5 not_speed not_still not_got not_the not_original not_clutch The standard stereo with CD player sounds great speakers are high quality I cannot not_drive not_without not_tunes not_in not_my not_car not_so not_this not_was not_important not_to not_me It is the best car I have owned When I first purchased it I thought I would keep it for 2 3 years tops If you re worried about a bumpy Explorer or any other SUV the tires will make all the difference in the world Since I dont not_have not_children not_the not_2 not_door not_Sport not_works not_for not_me not_If not_you not_have not_children not_or not_frequent not_rear not_seat not_passengers not_you not_may not_want not_to not_consider not_the not_4 not_door Of course im grateful that nobody was ever injured because of my Firestone tires I have to admit though that in my situation the recall worked in my favor I had 60 000 miles on my car when the recall began and needed new tires I got 5 brand new tires for free I should comment that since trading in my Firestones for better quality Michelins the ride in much smoother But now that I am 4 miles from work I only fill up once a week and am much happier Poor gas mileage comes with owning a big car Ford Explorer or other I highly recommend the Ford Explorer People tend to either love or hate Fords ive heard it all Ford stands for Found On Road Dead blah blah blah but I cant not_say not_enough not_good not_things not_about not_my not_Ford Okay I have to admit this is my first Ford Up until 1997 when I bought my Ford Explorer Sport new I had always been a Volkswagen girl I LOVE the way Volkswagens handle and look but I spent more time gettin them repaired then driving em So in 1997 I decided to shop around for an SUV and fell in love with the Explorer Sport THe Explorer is the most reliable car I have owned I never worry about getting stuck somewhere because the engine wont start or having it die on the freeway NOT fun in L A I have 70 000 miles on it and have only needed routine maintenance on it oil changes filters brakes
Pos,It pays to have a ford We average about 17 miles to the gallon The only down fall is that the gas mileage is not not_that not_great We have the extended cab version and it has six seats total My husband and I like trucks for the fact that it does anything and everything you want From moving yourself to transporting our dogs and anything else you need to going over terrain that most cars and some trucks cant not_even not_begin not_to not_handle But there is two tanks that hold 32 gallons total so it is nice not not_having not_to not_hit not_the not_gas not_station so often I also like the size you dont not_feel not_so not_small not_on not_the not_road not_parking is not not_that not_great but it is worth it for saftey reasons I would recommend having a large vehicle for any family I was in a wreck a drunk driver hit me from behind at about 50 mph while we were sitting at a red light and We felt nothing it took out my bumper but that was all we were fine an the other van was very badly damaged
Pos,They handle like a dream These cars are built very solid They even have a very sturdy roof They can absorb much force in a collision They have a very large amount of space It usually ranges from 20 to 21 miles per gallon One owned as a private vehicle would work positive wonders on your maintenance bill We use them as chase cars basically but we call them zone cars Working for the rescue squad in my city I occasionally get the chance to drive a Ford Crown Victoria It keeps us extremely mobile First I need to comment on the handling of these cars This may not not_seem not_like not_much not_but not_just not_think not_of not_how not_many not_times not_we not_gun not_the not_engine not_with not_these not_cars not_everyday The city garage maintains the cars however we still get the chance to see what repairs have been made if any The seats in addition to this are designed deep in an effort to keep you in place while going around curves Most of the equipment will fit in the trunk if not not_all of it if you position it right Along with tools a jack and the spare tire We can carry everything an ambulance has on board with the exception of the stretcher and still have plenty of room for a couple of passengers They have a very tight grip on the road and the steering is not not_lose not_at not_all and has little to no play in it unlike the majority of Ford built vehicles When an ambulance responds to a scene a paramedic can chase the ambulance or beat the ambulance to the scene using one of these cars Response time for paramedics is much more efficient this way There are plenty of other vehicles out there which would have worked just fine for the job we use the vehicles for but I can see why the city chose to use these above all others They are designed to do just that absorb most of the impact and protect the driver Loaded down with brake and sudden motion activated seat belts dual airbags shatterless windows and a crumbling body they can be trusted to get you to where you need to be safely Once in a great while something other than that will have to be repaired but what car does that not not_happen not_on not_If not_you not_can not_find not_one not_let

preventative maintenance and for the most part all we have seen done on these cars is fluid changes engine cleaning and adjusting the alignment balance rotation and changing tires I can say that the tires seem to get worn more often than a lot of other cars but once again look how we drive these cars and besides a different tire brand could help that but our city is pretty stubborn If you re wondering where I became familiar of how well the car protects the driver they have been rolled wrapped around poles had head on collisions beent boned rear ended etc etc and drivers walked away from all of it with nothing more than seatbelt sores airbag abrasions and a bruised ego statement based on info gathered from sources in this rescue squad as well as the local police departments I have yet to wreck one and I hope I dont The space in the front is very good as well Located up there is a clipboard many map books a mounted computer several radios the control panel for the lights and sirens and yes still room for passengers I think these cars are very comfortable I have to drive them constantly around the city for 12 hours at a time and by the end of the day other than being tired of working I still feel just as comfortable as I did when I first got into the car A direct quote given to me from one of the people that spends much of their duty time in a zone car All of these factors

Pos,I bought this car as a repairable for 3 k and I am glad I did Not that far in deep snow trust me on that one I put a new Sony sound system Yes all Sony in a car In the condition I have it in now it is valued at 6 000 Anyway it is a great first car for a student and is very safe with dual front Air Bags It was all right I strongly recommend this car I have had a great time driving this around town Seeing it is so small it can go anywhere The seating is comfortable for about a few hours then may get a little tiring No long road trips I was a little hesitant to get on the freeway the car being so small in all for the first time but a few times after When looking for an Aspire look for one with under 60 000 miles I bought mine with 43 000 on it and it has run fine A friend of mine bought one with 96 000 and has had to have the transmission and various other things replaced If Ford was still making the Aspire I would send the 11 000 base price and buy another It sounds good in it a few months after I bought it the previous owner did not not_take not_care not_of not_the not_old not_one not_I not_would not_recommend not_the not_four not_door not_model not_over not_the not_two not_door not_because not_it not_has not_Power not_Steering not_and not_it not_is not_easier not_for not_the not_rear not_seat not_passengers not_to not_get not_in not_I not_would not_also not_recommend not_for not_those not_in not_the not_North not_like not_me not_to not_get not_one not_with not_a not_Rear not_defroster not_or not_have not_an not_after not_market not_one not_installed not_I not_also not_recommend not_getting not_A not_C not_Little not_cars not_with not_big not_windows not_get not_pretty not_warm not_in not_the not_summer
Pos,It is a good buy if you want a small car The suspension and other parts of the car should last you for a long time It has good gas mileage which is necessary for these recent gas price increases and it handles beautifully It has a lot of room in the back for all of the passengers or any other cargo that you had to carry The trunk is really big so you can fit whatever you need it to The steering is tight and responsive and the car is solid I drive cars hard and have yet to have a problem with this one The Ford Contour is a nice roomy little sports car that wont sack you in the wallet Its got the option of a sporty engine still small liters for good gas mileage a 2 5 liter V 6 under the hood that packs a little kick behind the pedal The stereo is what really shocked me though For a Ford stock radio and speakers it really sounds nice I have the stock tape deck I dont not_think not_that not_they not_offer not_any not_other not_options not_for not_the not_radio but I could be wrong All in all the contour is a nice car for a little money if you re in the market for a small compact car
Pos,The recalls Also the car looks great and feels great All of the buttons are reachable and the cup holders are a great feature Here are the issues 1 The trunk Sporty sturdy cute thats what I thought when I first saw the Contour on the lot of my local and thankfully reputable used car dealer Overall I have been very pleased with the gas mileage drive ability and passenger room It leaks Granted this may have been the result of an unreported collision by the cars first owner However it took me three trips to my local Ford dealer the car was still under warranty to fix the problem 2 They re copious Every other day I seem to get a friendly but pointed letter asking me to bring the car back to a licensed Ford dealer for yet another tune up While I genuinely appreciate Fords commitment to their drivers safety I wish they would iron out these issues before the cars come to market My mechanic and I are becoming best friends
Pos,As soon as the car warms up the transmission stops slipping The second thing that we have experienced is a headlight problem Of course my husband is a mechanic so maybe he just made it look easy It still slips on really cold mornings but its something I have learned to live with and expect One is the transmission gave out a few years ago and my husband contacted a transmission guy he knows who told him how to fix it with practically a twist of a wrench Those are the only two problems we have ever had out of our Thunderbird and it is 9 years old at this point so I am very impressed with it And we arent easy on the old gal either We wanted something big enough to accommodate 3 children in the back seat because we werent ready for becoming a minivan family and this car is perfect to seat 2 car seats and another child comfortably in the back My Thunderbird has 106 000 miles on it and we have only experienced two minor problems When we purchased our 1991 Ford Thunderbird Sport with a V8 and automatic almost 5 years ago I really had to do some convincing to get my husband to buy a Ford He has always been a Chevy man I must say it has turned out to be a really good decision on our part It has primer on the door panel where I had a slight mishap and she gets way over due on her oil changes but she just keeps on trucking along for us I have been really happy with the ride comfort and the reliability and I would recommend the 1991 Thunderbird to any of my friends We will be driving down the road at night and suddenly the headlights will go out My husband has replaced the headlight switch and it didnt not_remedy not_the not_problem not_A not_friend not_of not_his not_who not_owns not_a not_Ford not_says not_that not_he not_also not_has not_this not_problem not_with not_his not_headlights not_so not_maybe not_it not_is not_a not_known not_problem not_that not_can not_be not_easily not_fixed not_I not_dont not_drive not_a not_whole not_lot not_after not_dark not_so not_this not_isnt not_a not_real not_major not_problem not_for not_me not_but not_it not_is not_quite not_bothersome not_when not_I not_do not_have not_to not_drive not_at not_night
Pos,The bottom line is that the Thunderbird is a comfortable and well designed car at a reasonable price This is a important feature for me as I seem to move every 3 6 months The brakes do tend to squeek a bit but the noise is no indication of a performance issue The Final Verdict As long as you like burgundy vehicles and live in an area thats at least 30 Italian the Thunderbird is a great option That kind of positioning allows the Thunderbird to provide the rider with great control as your feel for the road is significantly enhanced In the same arena as the ride is the ease of use of the console which for me equals smoothness and ease The Thunderbirds radio and air console is incredibly well designed with everything within reach and intuitively organized Seem trivial to you Try changing the station at 75 miles an hour and see how important knob placement is 4 Trunk The trunk on the Thunderbird is big enough for all of your luggage not not_to not_mention not_the not_corpse not_of not_Vinnie not_The not_Chin not_from not_a not_rival not_family not_My not_Defense not_I not_have not_read not_another not_review not_of not_this not_vehicle not_that not_criticizes not_the not_brake not_quality and I have to vehemently disagree with it I ride my brakes hard and I have never had a lockup or other incident Cruising In My Big T I have had my 91 Thunderbird for 4 years now bought it way back in my freshman year and it has served me well throughout college I am a horrible Northern driver and brutal on my vehicles but this piece of Ford craftsmanship refuses to bail out on me Its a rough and tumble vehicle that remains an incredible deal for the price especially when bought used from a reputable dealer The Advantages 1 Seat Space These are big seats people with the kind of legroom that only those pretentious you know whats in first class usually get their hands on And that spaciousness isnt not_just not_about not_spoiling not_the not_people not_up not_front not_either not_it not_extends not_to not_the not_back not_seat not_as not_well not_which not_means not_that not_everyone not_feels not_just not_a not_little not_bit not_more not_comfortable not_and not_relaxed not_when not_you not_get not_to not_wherever not_you not_re not_going not_And not_not not_only not_are not_the not_seats not_big not_but not_the not_generous not_amount not_of not_padding not_in not_each not_makes not_for not_an not_especially not_comfortable not_ride not_2 not_Appearance not_ive not_gt not_to not_admit not_it not_to not_you not_I not_just not_love not_the not_look not_of not_the not_Thunderbird not_though not_it not_is not_an not_acquired not_taste not_to not_be not_sure not_I not_can not_best not_describe not_the not_style not_as not_Italian not_sleek not_in not_a not_chunky not_way not_and not_available not_in not_colors not_like not_burgundy not_that not_make not_it not_look not_like not_a not_cross not_between not_a not_hit not_mobile not_and not_a not_hearse not_3 not_Smooth not_Ride not_Riding not_in not_my not_Thunderbird not_has not_always not_seemed not_quite not_smooth not_to not_me not_especially not_when not_you not_consider not_how not_low not_to not_the not_ground not_it not_is not_Why not_so not_low
Pos,When we left Williams AZ the car was buried under snow as we had a cold snap and snow dig the snow away and turn the key starting the engine at once and never missing a beat The car came with the premium sound system but the radio cassette was playing up so replaced it with a Pioneer radio CD I went to the wreckers and bought an electric motor seat assembly for the right hand side so when converting to RHD will have an electric adjustment Also bought a sports instrument cluster and centre handbrake assy out of a super coupe These cars were never made for export or for Right Hand Drive so have to get all the parts needed now for conversion I did 18 000 miles in 9 months without the car stopping or letting me down I gave the car 4 oil changes added fuel octane booster with every tank of gas it has the factory 15 alloy wheels with Michelin tyres I found the car very easy to drive and steer but did experience brake shudder which appears to be a common problem due to thin brake rotors I added a rear spoiler and had the windows tinted which makes the car look sporty as in Australia the only 2 door cars are mainly Jap imports so in the end I shipped the car back to Australia where I have to convert it over to Right Hand Drive for our road rules this cars owes me 10 000 Australia 5200 US landed back at my house in Australia which when converted to RHD they sell from 35 000 to 40 000 18 000 to 21 000 US BEST CAR I HAVE EVER OWNED I arrived in the states from Australia at the end of March 1999 to stay there for a year and come home at the end of March 2000 I stayed with friends in South Carolina who is a Ford man as I have always owned GM or Chevs they lent me a 1979 red corvette until I bought myself a car so after 3 months I did buy a 1985 Z28 Camaro 350 to fix up and use for the 9 months after looking at it I thought this was a bad idea so looked in the local paper and found a red 1991 V8 Thunderbird with 114 000 miles on it for 3000 After taking it for a test drive offered the lady 2800 and drove it home it had a slight water leak from the water pump so while replacing it I installed a set of under drive pulleys which I could notice the power increase the first time I drove it put a K amp N air cleaner in as well I had a friend come over from Australia so we drove from Greenville SC across to Sequin TX did about 3000 miles in that trip we took the long way and had no trouble at all and got 27 MPG sitting on 80 MPH had a radar detector it has a highway ratio in it 2 75 My brother came over from Australia so we went from Greenville SC down to Daytona Beach and back then drove across America to California which we did about 4600 miles trouble free
Pos,The previous Mustang looked more balanced Engine The list of standard equipment looks good Or maybe im getting old and grumpy Suspension The dealer talked too much during the test drive It might eat some power but not not_that not_much not_Transmission The 3 8L 193 hp engine does not not_seem not_all not_that not_powerful not_even not_with not_stick Note the A C was on during the test drive and was very efficient The suspension is not not_only stiff but creates a lot of unnecessary up and down motions The car uses live axle in the rear so I didnt not_expect not_much not_anyway not_Standard not_Equipment The last three safety fuel economy and reliability also depend on the way you drive Pricing As I said the C pillars are wide in coupe and the interior room is smaller than Id like The clutch also engaged very high in the pedal travel I drove some Eastern European cars for several years and never had complaints like this one They always try to do that to distract you but I noticed the following things Styling You can argue but I think it could be better The car looks bulky the C pillars are thick which increases blind spots I was afraid to run over somebody while backing up the standard wheels look crude The shifter has quite short travel which is good but the clutch does not not_provide not_any not_feedback not_you not_cannot not_feel not_it not_engage not_by not_the not_pedal not_pressure or the dealer talked too much We went on the freeway onramp and I was disappointed Strange considering the 220 lb ft of torque rating at as low as 2800 rpm European and Japanese manufacturers manage to extract more than 200 hp out of 3 0 liter engines It includes power windows mirrors locks and remote keyless entry alloy ugly wheels AM FM CD cassette player A C dual vanity mirrors etc Interior Interior materials fit and finish looks cheap I did not not_expect not_walnut not_for not_16 not_K but Ford could have done better This review is about Ford Mustang 3 8L Coupe with stick shift I test drove when I considered buying it I say considered because I did not not_buy not_it and here is why Test Drive If you like Mustangs styling and features and decide to buy it it is a good deal providing you with electric everything remote keyless entry radio CD cassette V6 engine and alloy wheels for less than 16 If you want refinement fit and finish safety and reliability get ready to pay more for something else I The price was good in theory I know that you can get the car for less than 16 K at CarsDirect com for example but the particular dealership I went to wanted more than 17 K and did not not_want not_to not_negotiate not_the not_price not_at not_all not_Besides not_they not_were not_very not_pushy not_and not_rude not_Needles not_to not_say not_they not_did not_not not_earn not_my not_business not_they not_didnt not_even not_try The dealer was constantly asking what monthly payment I can afford Well I can afford the payment I need to get better car I walked after which they called me several times asking how they can make me buy the car today I was unable to produce any kind of positive reply on this one I In car buying a lot depends on personal taste The steering wheel tilts but does not not_telescope not_which not_might not_be not_a not_problem not_for not_the not_tall not_people not_Insurance not_and not_Safety not_Insurance not_rates not_are not_high not_especially not_if not_you not_are not_a not_male not_younger not_than not_25 not_The not_crash not_test not_results not_are not_not not_encouraging not_either not_the not_overall not_rating not_is not_Acceptable not_with not_Poor not_death not_rate not_and not_Marginal not_injury not_rate not_Fuel not_Economy not_I not_didnt not_get not_a not_chance not_to not_see not_the not_actual not_fuel not_consumption not_myself but on paper its 19 MPG city 29 MPG highway Not impressive for the car of this size with manual transmission Warranty and Reliability Consumer Reports magazine says that Mustang has poor reliability Ford provides 36 000 mile 3 year warranty and 5 year corrosion warranty Majority of other manufacturers offers 60 000 mile 5 year powertrain warranty 100 000 mile 10 year warranty for Hyundai Kia
Pos,That will be a whole different proposition and will see about it then Surprisingly good quality Two latches one switch and no roof Many may not not_agree but to me Mustang looks super sexy especially in convertible form The current Mustang is the best value you can find if what you are looking for is power The all new 2004 Ford Mustang will be based in the DEW98 platform the state of the art base for the Ford Thunderbird Lincoln LS and Jaguars Type Ford tried to make a front wheel driver out of the Mustang but at the very last minute they backed up In a very different and less relaxed way however than more sophisticated entries in the market Mustang is all about rough power and it shows all the time No other car offers you such bang for your buck now that the Camaro Firebird twins were killed by corporate father GM and those two were super uncomfortable cars anyway The ride is the best you can expect from a rear wheel driver with a solid axle rear suspension and that does not not_mean not_is not_bad not_at not_all Is a throw back to the days of the original pony cars but with a very contemporary feel provided by a extremely well behave steering quick to respond and very linear If you ask me I think is a great thing Why Lets see First Mustang was able to retain the rear wheel drive configuration that is the way a pony car is meant to be In the late 80s Ford has made little or no buzz about the fact that the current Ford Mustang is based on the current longest living platform in the American auto industry and probably of the American market as well the current Mustang is based in the Fox platform first used in the 1978 Ford Fairmont Mercury Zephyr Maybe they are not not_sure not_whether not_this not_is not_a not_good not_or not_a not_bad not_thing not_to not_let not_people not_know The result was the Ford Probe not not_a not_bad not_car not_in not_any not_respect not_but not_definitely not_not not_a not_Mustang not_Maybe not_a not_Celica not_or not_a not_Prelude but not not_a not_Mustang not_Second Is really cheap to buy own maintain and repair Third Ford has had over 24 years to improve this platform and it shows Mustang 3 8 V 6 Convertible Ride The Ford Mustang 3 8 V 6 convertible with a stick shift is a really fun car to drive It actually is a very enjoyable ride with a very distinctive American flavor Cowl shake is not not_nearly not_as not_bad not_as not_you not_would not_expect not_from not_a not_convertible not_in not_this not_price not_field but there is some which I guess is the price you have to pay in exchange for the pleasures of open air motoring Interior Seats are supportive enough if you are not not_an not_NBA not_player and there is plenty of space in the front cabin and nearly none in the back which anyway is a given in the pony car segment Interior materials are far from being the best and I would advice to take a good look at Fords accessories catalog to personalize an although well designed monochromatic and cheap looking interior None of the above means that the instrumentation is not not_well not_laid not_out and that controls are not not_at not_the not_reach not_of not_your not_hand not_when not_needed not_Power not_Power not_is not_more not_than not_adequate not_190 not_hp not_inV not_6 not_form not_moves not_the not_Mustang not_convertible not_from not_0 not_to not_60 not_mph not_in not_7 not_7 not_seconds not_this not_is not_former not_GT not_territory not_Top not_Convertible not_top not_is not_simple not_fast not_and not_powered
Pos,When it does respond though you do have some decent power It is well worth the extra money IF you want a decent stereo system These break EASILY and it somewhat ruins the look of the car Be careful on wet pavement though as the tires fight to get traction One complaint the front end Where the optional flood lights would go the Mustang has some plastic air vents The glove compartment is too small and in a very inconvenient location I do like the OPTIONAL mach 4 audio system The body styling of the Mustang is beautiful Many people tend to stare at the Mustang longer than most cars The 2001 Mustang is a fun car to drive and look at With its rear wheel drive it handles the corners quite nicely The antenna is in an awkward place and it also detracts from the look of the Mustang Overall the Mustang delivers a decent sports car for the price The light knobs a c controls are very cheap looking If you want rear floor mats for this car you have to purchase them seperately The v 6 engine has some pep in it This car really takes off from a stand still Passing cars on the highway is not not_a not_problem not_as not_the not_engine not_has not_a not_lot not_in not_reserve If you are looking for performance I would recommend getting the GT v 8 When you get to the interior of the car you start to see where Ford cut costs Two small problems with the engine First between 35 50 mph the engine seems to lose power and gets sluggish Secondly when you accelerate it takes a few seconds for the engine to respond
Pos,The car overall looks good The paint is also very nicely done This thing hugs curves like a car half its weight It doesnt like to shift too hard which hurt performance The ride is however jarring because the suspension is fairly stiff to accomodate its excellent handling The only issue I have with the looks is the plastic inserts in the fake hood scoop and side vents The motor responds well to pressure on the pedal but isnt not_as not_harsh not_as not_many not_of not_the not_other not_big not_V not_8s With the upcoming demise of the GM F body cars the Mustang remains the first and last of a long breed of American muscle The exhaust looks and sounds good but I would have preferred a slightly throatier note from it Next up is the handling The only complaints I have otherwise are that the transmission in the automatic is somewhat sloppy for a purported Muscle Sports car With the traction control it even survives hard mashing on the accelerator so you get some extra traction thats somewhat atypical of RWD muscle The 2001 Mustang GT certainly holds itself to some pretty steep standards and it does just fine in meeting them too First off lets talk power On to more practical items the car is fairly comfortable considering its lineage I have charcoal gray leather and they look good and feel very supportive but not not_hard The thing is rated at 260hp and 300 lb feet of torque For those of you who dont not_know not_what not_those not_numbers not_mean not_its not_fast From a distance they look fine but up close they re not not_very not_attractive not_I not_might not_go not_so not_far not_as not_to not_recommend not_actually not_removing not_them not_from not_the not_side not_vents However the stick has issues of its own so I would recommend following my lead and just get a good aftermarket system if you dont not_want not_to not_live not_with not_the not_annoyances not_of not_the not_stock not_5 not_speed not_and not_the not_power not_loss not_of not_the not_automatic The interior overcomes the annoying Ford plastic dollhouse look and unlike say the Probe doesnt look cheap and flimsy at all In fact what clinched the Mustang for me over a brand new Tiburon GT besides the extra power was the less cheesy looking insides of the Mustang You have to be careful because the short light backend is highly prone to scampering out from under you but on dry clean pavement this thing holds the road tight and doesnt let go Just watch it in the rain though and snow is out of the question It can grow tiresome very quickly on constantly rough pavement Also dont not_try not_to not_shove not_anyone not_except not_the not_smallest not_children not_in not_the not_back not_Anyone not_over not_about not_10 not_years not_of not_age is not not_going not_to not_be not_please not_with not_you not_otherwise not_Gas not_mileage not_is not_acceptable not_but not_this not_is not_a not_moderate not_size not_V8 not_so not_dont not_expect not_miracles not_I not_get not_about not_19 not_26 not_with not_my not_driving not_habits At 260hp its easily out muscled by Camaros and Trans Ams but not not_much if anything else in the general price range provides the tire shredding power that a properly driven GT can produce and the F Bodies generally cost a little more anyway Mine is temporarily and automatic so I lose a little in the 0 60 and 1 4 mile numbers but its still no slouch Onramps have never been this much fun and passing is a breeze
Pos,There are three types of Mustangs The cabin has a high quality feel for the price The sound system provides great quality even with the base system The brakes are exceptional Inside the Mustang is well finished It was once a rental car and it has 15 800 miles The car has the firm ride of a sports car and is relatively quiet The steering communicates lots of road feel and the car handles well One weakness with the car is the lack of rear seat room and the small trunk When driving around town the car quickly accelerates and passing is very easy However all this power means below average fuel economy ive been averaging 18 miles per gallon At first I didnt not_realize not_that not_I not_could not_afford not_a not_2001 not_Mustang not_I not_found not_a not_great not_deal not_and not_purchased not_my not_red not_Mustang All the controls are within reach and very well designed and the cup holders are of the best in any car ive seen When picking out my first car I had a lot of factors I considered First I wanted a car that was fun to drive and attractive I also needed a reliable that was under 15 000 The 194 horsepower V6 the GT V8 and the high performance Cobra I purchased the V6 with the Deluxe package ABS traction control power seat spoiler CD ive owned the car for about 7 months and I havent encountered a problem yet The car is very fun to drive However most people in the sports car market dont not_have not_a not_spacious not_rear not_seat not_on not_the not_top not_of not_their not_priority not_list not_Overall not_the not_Mustang not_is not_an not_excellent not_car not_A not_sports not_car not_should not_be not_fast not_attractive not_and not_fun not_The not_Mustang not_has not_all not_these not_qualities not_and not_then not_some not_which not_is not_why not_it not_has not_been not_one not_of not_Americas not_most not_popular not_sports not_cars not_for not_almost not_40 not_years
Pos,To date I have only one minor complaint about the car it is thirsty Time will tell as we have only had the Mustang since June of 2001 Relatively poor gas mileage Captured by the styling I have to admit we were captured by the appearance of the 2001 GT Convertible We own both a new style Camero and the Mustang The Mustang seems to have more durable components in the cab then our Camero One caveat though if you opt for standard interior instead of the premium the seats are much less comfortable a least for a guy my size Make sure to test both before deciding Good fit and finish I have read less then favorable remarks about the fit and finish on the Mustang However I am very pleased We average 16 miles to gallon in town I guess we should have expected this but I actually thought it might be closer to 20 It has a beautiful beefy sound under acceleration but is quiet at steady speeds Small but comfortable on the inside I am 6 1 and 230 lbs but feel very much at home in the cockpit of the Mustang As teenagers in the early 70s the stying is obviously a through back to that era We love looks Strong V8 Although I wouldnt not_want not_to not_race not_a not_325 not_h not_p not_Camero not_SS not_the not_260 not_h not_p not_V not_8 has an amazing amount of power Ford must have also done their homework in producing the exhaust note of this engine
Pos,The instrument panel is put together very well This window lacks a release from the inside ive been driving a 2000 6 cylinder 4 door 4wd Explorer for six months now So far it has its ups and downs The downs although better than some SUVs it drinks gas like a dog on a hot day the interior is fairly noisy it is not not_the not_ideal not_choice not_for not_towing not_large not_loads The ups you sit higher and get a better feel for the road it reacts quicker than most vehicles because of its short wheel base plenty of room to stretch my big feet The back door which lifts up has a glass that can also be opened up Ideal for putting small items in the back without having to put all you weight into shutting the big door You have to open it from the back door I titled this review Explod er because of the tire incident this past summer I believe you should really look hard at this vehicle before buying it The Explorer certainly fits some lifestyles but for others there are better vehicles It is easy to read and everything important is exactly where you want it to be The back seats fold down easily to make an eight foot bed Plenty of room for spreading out a sleeping bag I wish it had a cable release for the back window
Pos,You must anticipate these repairs For example my SHO carried an average wholesale over 3000 and retail 4800 but I bought for 2900 If this was not not_done not_by not_the not_original not_owner anticipate a 700 repair by an honest good reasonable shop twice that by a dishonest shop The automatic has had no problems but the clutch plate for the SHO must be upgraded because the original is too weak and will fail However if you are considering these vehicles you must get them at a price that allows you to address the maintenance and repairs that are common to this vehicle The LX is loaded with everything like climate control electric seats etc all continue to work well The SHO has many sport car luxuries such as sun roof fog lamps powerful engine etc However the design has flaws which once fixed and usually with upgraded Ford redesigned parts that replaced the original design you end up with a super very reliable car Just anticiate the extra investment The repairs that will typically cause the owners to sell are front axle boots drive joints engine rear seal oil leak and cooling system leaks particularly the heater block which is inside the fire wall and very difficult to replace These are solid heavy cars that even with no airbag or one airbag will often in an accident hammer the other vehicle as hard as a SUV Remember bulk and weight are very important when in an accident the heavy guy usually wins The SHO has a 5 speed the LX an automatic I have purchased an 1989 SHO sedan with 97 k miles 2 900 in 3 2000 vs 4800 book and a 1990 LX sedan with 85 k miles 3 000 in 8 1998 vs 4500 book Both were mint condition no damage and like new inside and nearly new outside Both have proven to be solid cars reliable and safe If the seller does not not_believe not_you not_go not_to not_the not_NTSB not_web not_page not_and not_printout not_the not_repair not_and not_recall not_lists not_for not_the not_Taurus not_in not_those not_years not_and not_show not_them not_what not_to not_expect not_I not_do not_not not_wish not_to not_scare not_you not_away not_with not_these not_stories not_these not_are not_very not_good not_solid not_cars not_if not_you not_find not_well not_cared not_for not_ones At times there can be engine block problems particularly with the 3 8 engine usually caused by people driving away without allowing some warm up time I didnt not_have not_the not_vehicles not_checked not_by not_a not_mechanic not_I not_used not_my not_relatively not_good not_judgment not_on not_condition not_After not_investing not_1 not_000 not_in not_the not_1990 not_and not_1600 not_in not_the not_89 not_SHO not_I not_have not_two not_vehicles not_that not_are not_in not_my not_opinion not_as not_good not_as not_new not_certainly not_good not_for not_75 not_000 not_to not_100 not_000 not_more not_I not_care not_for not_my not_vehicles not_currently not_with not_a not_Corsica not_1990 not_at not_193 not_000 not_and not_still not_going not_strong not_Since not_I not_was not_buying not_very not_well not_cared not_for not_cars not_and not_still not_had not_to not_pay not_for not_major not_repairs not_I not_urge not_you not_to not_only not_purchase not_one not_of not_these not_vehicles not_at not_below not_book not_even not_below not_average not_wholesale
Pos,the 1990 year ford taurus is a excellent family car there is ample room for cross town trip or cross country trips the ford taurus gives you a very reliable means of transportation and you get very good gas mileage on average i get 27 mpg in town and 36 mpg highway this car is a good car for some one with a family but i would not not_recommend not_that not_you not_get not_a not_taurus not_for not_a not_young not_adult not_if not_they not_a not_sports not_car not_kind not_of not_driver not_it not_is not_not not_made not_to not_be not_driven not_like not_that not_the not_ford not_taurus not_does not_have not_very not_well not_take not_off not_and not_is not_a not_very not_reliable not_car not_and not_very not_comfortable not_car not_to not_drive not_or not_ride not_in

Pos,They gave the Windstar 5 stars out of a possible 5 for crash worthiness The van finished third behind the Toyota Sienna and Honda Odyssey in their tests The turn signal control is a silly place to put a wiper button anyway The stems off the steering wheel were the only item that caused me concern On the right side stem the driver finds the gear shift lever with the overdrive button recessed into the tip These little things like the aforementioned cup holders and map pockets make a surprising amount of difference in overall consumer protection Thats simply annoying design but the dangerous design is on the left side stem which controls turn signals and dual interval wiper systems The stereo was big and bold sounding with the requisite tuning and pseudo equalizer buttons I particularly liked the oversized radio station buttons On more than one occasion I signaled for a left turn only to unexpectedly spray the windshield with fluid and start the wipers The Windstar has plenty of get up and go Theres a 3 8 liter V6 with 200 hp more of both than the Odyssey or the Grand Caravan There was always plenty of power left over to respond to changing road conditions I also found the ride itself to be smooth The Windstars critics have complained of the same top heavy swaying feeling I found in the Grand Voyager I didnt not_find not_much not_swaying not_at not_all not_even not_when not_accelerating not_in not_curves A safety group run for the insurance industry the Highway Loss Data Institute found that the addition of the side air bags made the Windstar one of the safest passenger van in its 40 mph crash tests This van has torque to spare with 240 foot pounds at 3600 rpm again better than both vehicles I found myself passing slower moving vehicles with just a tap on the responsive accelerator That said the dual interval wipers are neat and do a tremendously good job in maintaining visibility through even heavy rain Interior visibility is terrific however thanks to a mini mirror that swings down between the driver and passenger seats in front The very first thing I noticed when I settled into the drivers seat was the ledge over the window well Its a perfect height for resting a drivers arm yes I know you should drive with two hands on the wheel And along with reliability family buyers treasure safety above every other attribute Airbags including side airbags are standard on this vehicle but that only comprises a small portion of safety The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA or http www nhtsa gov is the agency responsible for crash testing vehicles for the federal government In fact the biggest criticism I could find on the ride was that there is a small but significant blind spot just off the right rear bumper Some jiggling with mirrors restricted from field of vision to other sides but stopped me from driving several smaller cars off the road SAFETY Lets face it Families buy minivans This is not not_intended not_as not_a not_rear not_view not_mirror but as a way to watch folks even in the back row Parents with kids are going to love this feature because it doesnt detract at all from the rear view mirror and is easily seen from either driver or passenger seat Finally the killer comfort issue was found on the fourth door That gets you 10 of the way there if you use the money down and based on your trade you might even be able to lower your payments if you mix 1000 cash back with a Ford Motor Credit APR offer Until I get a chance to drive the Odyssey Fords Windstar has leaped to the top of my minivan list The ubiquitous minivan is frequently sold on consumer feel good items such as the placement and size of cup holders the presence of map pockets or the number of zones in which the climate control can be split Fords 2000 Windstar does well on these creature comfort areas but excels in safety and reliability critical areas for the family oriented minivan market segment I just spent a week driving the Windstar through a variety of street and weather conditions And speaking of the cup holders the two recessed under the ashtray in the front were adjustable and fit different sized cups with a simple squeeze of the ratcheted plastic ring I was very impressed with the interior lighting which gave plenty of directed illumination at night without making it difficult to continue driving Even the climate controls for the passengers in the rear two rows are illuminated at night a nice feature that not not_every not_minivan not_shares This is the third minivan ive test driven in the last five months and so far is my favorite I still havent driven the Honda Odyssey which has better all around numbers but the Windstar performs better than the Plymouth Grand Voyager and its Dodge Caravan twin Since this was Dodges baby to begin with thats a hard statement to write but Ford has done a terrific job with this van THE RIDE Feel the acceleration The Windstar weighs a good 100 pounds more than the Grand Voyager and although neither are in serious big SUV territory at just under 4000 pounds they are solid The Windstars wheelbase is bigger than I would have liked at over 120 inches contributing to a bigger than expected turning radius Several times I found myself faced with the choice of making a three point turn or doing some curb cutting I knew that acceleration was there for some reason This was actually a step down for the Windstar which used to be rated as best in its class but the Odysseys redesign catapulted the 2000 model over the Windstar Still these three vehicles were the only ones to receive HLDIs overall good rating in their class Self sealing tires and a reverse sensor system that alerts the driver when the rear bumper is within five feet of something are safety options that are well worth considering Ford has packaged multiple options into several safety packages so depending on what you want to put on your van you might find it cheaper to buy a package than to add single options CREATURE COMFORTS Yes the Windstar is available as a four door unit too perfect for families who can enter on driver or passenger side I also found that the bucket seats in the second row were nice and roomy while the third row bench seat easily folded down or was removed THE BOTTOM LINE Auto dealers are still getting near sticker price for the Honda Odyssey last years minivan darling If price is a factor at all I find that the Windstar stacks up very favorably against the Odyssey and now is the time to buy 2000 models since the 2001s are now in stock Ford is also trying to move the 2000 units and has a 2500 customer cash offer out through October 31
Pos,If you are thinking minivan for your next purchase The right front door cannot not_be not_opened not_with not_a not_key not_there not_is not_NO not_keyhole So what are they good for Like the song says Absolutely Nothin Thats pretty neat makes me wish I had gotten the left door that way too It was a close call over the Honda Odyssey Truth is there are a lot of great vehicles out there nowadays You might want to just take my word for it I did the research Windstar is a good deal You know what else is pretty neat the outside mirrors not not_only are they powered mirrors they are heated To melt the ice which we will be getting our fair share of starting any day now No more scraping mirrors No matter though they have two others I think loaded with even more stuff if you have to have it The right side back door opens and closes at the push of a button It would have been a minor ding I am sure but it would have ruined a great driving record Thanks again Ford If this model doesnt have enough bells and whistles for you well I gotta tell you that you are pretty spoiled The only other thing that really bugs me is the back door lift gate or whatever they call it If anything ought to be powered this is it im guessing that if there is one feature that costs The ones in the front section of the car just under the radio that you have to pull out like a drawer Well they re a little chintzy if you ask me I dont not_trust not_them not_to not_hold not_my not_medium not_diet not_pepsi and they dont not_hold not_my not_coffee not_mug Works for me I could go on with what I like about it but if you re looking to buy one of these or one of the competitions versions then I better tell you what I dont not_like not_about not_it as well Gotta be fair The ride is nice of course when your vehicle is new you are careful to miss most bumps larger than a bottlecap but nevertheless I did not not_miss not_a not_few and I can tell you from experience Its a nice ride I got the SE model with

Pos,ive recently purchased a 2000 Ford Windstar LX The front end is more rounded imitating Chryslers styling initiatives This allows all passengers to ride in comfort The styling on the 2000 model has also been refined Due to poor visibility over the nose Windstar drivers were are constantly hitting parking rail guards If you are in the market for a Minivan and Safety and Comfort are a priority The sound is exceptional for a factory installed system Also recommended is the rear heat and air option The 6 way power drivers seat option with lumbar support adjustment is highly recommended Also optional is on the LX is remote controlled automatic passengers side sliding door This is a great convenience when toting small children Ford also offers a premium sound package with a CD player as an upgrade for about 300 Id highly recommend that you test drive the Windstar I think you ll agree that it compares quite nicely to its competitors But the Windstar is relatively easy to maneuver is quiet and is quite pleasant to drive and ride in The Captains seats are well padded and comfortable and are quite improved from earlier models The Windstar is adequately powered however you pay dearly for the additional boost in the anemic gas mileage you ll get The Windstar has a decent road feel but steering can at times feel vague But on the plus side this also seems to have improved visibility over the front nose of the van Next time your in a parking lot look at all the bent front license plates on earlier Windstar models A minor irritation becomes evident in rainy conditions you ll notice that the rear window wiper only seems to clear about half the drivers side of the window While I personally didnt not_have not_any not_problems not_with not_my not_96 not_model not_my not_sister not_had not_some not_of not_the not_renowned not_Windstar not_problems not_with not_her not_95 not_model not_head not_gasket not_electrical and has vowed never to purchase another Ford However from the group of people I know she is the only one to have serious problems with the Windstar Chrysler and GM have had there own share of problems mainly transmission related with their minivans We traded in our 1996 Windstar and are very pleased with the refinements that Ford has continued to make to the Windstar with each successive model year Ford was a little late in adding the fourth sliding door option and quite frankly they were probably caught a little bit by surprise when Chrysler introduced this innovation to the minivan market a couple of years ago But while Chrysler and GM were adding the additional door Ford was continuing to place an emphasis on Safety and Ride Quality The Windstar is the only Domestic Mini Van with a 5 Star Collision rating and for the year 2000 side impact air bags are an option
Pos,It makes for an extremely comfortable sleep The idea of removable seats is great It drives much more like a car than a van It doesnt have that top heavy awkward van feeling to it on corners The climate control system is quite good for the people in the front two seats We bought our new 2000 Ford Windstar last October and have been extremely happy with our purchase so far We often take them out when we go camping and put a mattress in the back The only thing that would be better would be if they could make the seats lighter There have been no mechanical problems at all Here are some of the features that we like best about our Windstar On the back of the back seat there are these great little hooks that you can use to hook grocery bags onto when you go shopping The tinted windows that we opted for help with this too Finally if you like to bring beverages in the car with you there are more cupholders in the van than you would believe We were also impressed with the amount of pep the engine has While its not not_a not_Porsche it does have very impressive acceleration for a van much more similar to a car again than to other vans I have driven This seems like a small feature but we really love it You no longer have to worry about the ice cream falling onto its side and leaking and you never have to repack your bags with all the items that spilled out during the drive home We used ours to move across the country and found it very helpful in packing and accessing our belongings once they were packed in We were quite impressed with the stereo system Before hearing it we had discussed having a better system installed but once we had our first listen we decided we d keep the factory installed model You need to be fairly muscular to take out the single seats we took the four bucket seats in the first two rows and the bench at the back option while the bench seat at the back is really a two person job to remove and reinstall Having the sliding doors on both sides is a very helpful feature that allows you to easily access just about anywhere in the vehicle We dont not_often not_have not_many not_passengers not_so not_it not_hasnt not_been not_too not_big not_of not_a not_problem not_for not_us but if you frequently carry a full load of passengers its something you might really want to think about I should add that there are two windows at the back that open slightly to help with air circulation which is great for your passengers when its hot and you dont not_want not_to not_use not_air not_conditioning From a cold start it heats up or provides air conditioning very quickly however there are no air vents to provide circulation to passengers in the back A couple of times now when we ve had a full load of people we have either had to bake or freeze in the front to keep our passengers in the back comfortable im not not_sure if there was an option to have rear climate controls but if there is it will be something we will think about getting next time
Pos,It doesnt The Windstar is also a much heavier vehicle We recently traded in our 1996 Dodge Caravan for a 2000 Ford Windstar It is practical and safe I would recommend it to anyone But the Windstar took right off ive been guilty of giving it too much gas many times because I expect it to need the extra push These are available in the Windstar but we did not not_want not_to not_add not_the not_cost not_of not_having not_them not_installed not_Our not_new not_Windstar not_is not_a not_beautiful not_vehicle We had had the Caravan for three years and I was very happy with it so when it came time to make the change I was a little leary However I found that the Windstar had almost all the features that I had had in the Caravan When I found out that the Windstar had a five star safety rating I was convinced The first time I drove our new Windstar I was amazed at the amount of power it had Our Caravan had always been rather sluggish when pulling out of our driveway and onto our uphill street The only thing missing from our new Windstar is the built in child restraints in the middle seat I dont not_use not_them not_for not_my not_own not_children but it is handy to have when extra kids are in the car unexpectedly It does not not_get not_swayed not_by not_the not_wind not_nearly not_as not_much not_as not_the not_Caravan not_I not_feel not_that not_it not_would not_hold not_up not_in not_a not_collision not_much not_better not_than not_the not_Caravan not_I not_feel not_much not_safer not_driving not_the not_Windstar not_knowing not_that not_it not_has not_a not_good not_safety not_rating not_I not_have not_three not_children not_of not_my not_own not_and not_always not_have not_my not_friends not_children not_in not_the not_car not_as not_well not_so not_safety not_is not_extremely not_important not_to not_me One of the most important features to me especially with getting three kids in and out is the sliding door on the driver side I was so glad to hear that the new Windstars had this It makes it so much easier getting small children and packages in and out without having to climb all the way inside Plus I feel much safer knowing that if we were in an accident there would be better accessibility to my children
Pos,It adjusts were well to abrupt and harsh driving conditions Being a young single person such as myself there is not not_much not_of not_a not_need not_for not_a not_minivan but I checked it out nonetheless When driving uphill you never fell the need to floor it just to be able to drive above 2 miles an hour No more line ups to get inside the van Once the seat is adjusted and you turn the engine on surprise a nice healthy engine with no obtrusive noises The only downside is inside the minivan Parents may notice that the rear window latches are a little on the clumsy side and have the potential to result in jammed little fingers After you hit the gas pedal and start driving you notice the immense power this vehicle has it is so smooth and able to achieve your desired speed rather quickly Its almost like driving a car While this isnt not_necessarily not_the not_most not_affordable not_minivan it is a good complete package boasting a modern appearance and a good ride making this a very good choice for people who need the roominess of a minivan but dont not_like not_traditional not_minivans When you see the light ahead about to turn red and get ready to hit the brakes the Windstar brakes so effortlessly coming to a complete stop exactly where you want to stop Even for those sudden slam on the brakes moments you will notice that this vehicle does not not_at not_all not_jerk not_you not_forward Aesthetically it has the same look and feel of other minivans but with a significant advantage Upon getting into the minvan you first notice the room no more cramped legs up front or in the rear with plenty of room to add accessories such as a console for beverages cds tapes etc Space aside the seats also have a great deal of maneuvering power so it is definitely possible to achieve that comfortable position you had in the last car Another plus is the rear sliding door as there is one on either side of the minivan
Pos,The ride is very comfortable The interior is very comfortable They all work great Concerns Long term reliability We ve had our 2000 Windstar SEL since July 2000 Its a much nicer more refined vehicle than our previous Chevrolet Astro and Plymouth Voyager Here are the things we like best about our Windstar That ll be a switch Id recommend the Windstar to anyone Its relatively spacious comfortable safe fun to drive and a good value These are relatively minor issues but I am concerned about long term reliability because we plan on keeping this van for many years The controls are laid out logically the rear ventilation system works great the seats are relatively comfortable and the power side doors work perfectly By the time we wear this one out our 2 older kids will be off to college and all we ll need is a car By far the Windstar is the most comfortable user friendly minivan we ve owned Its holding up well to kid abuse and the normal wear and tear of daily life The reliability issues concern us a little but it looks like we have the bugs worked out now We re looking forward to many years with our Windstar Its too bad however that this will likely be our last minivan So far we ve had the van into the dealer for 3 minor recall issues replacement of the intake manifold replacement of the front disc brake rotors and replacement of a front seat belt buckle to repair the malfunctioning seat belt warning system The styling is gorgeous Even though the Windstar design is getting a little old its still the most distinctive beautiful minivan on the road Safety Five stars Front and side airbags Reverse sensing system Anti lock brakes Traction control Conveniences like cup holders rear passenger ventilation system controls power side doors and the entertainment system Leg room for rear seat passengers is extremely limited Our sons are 15 and 12 and sometimes groan when they re relegated to the back seat As I said this is our third minivan Our kids are 8 12 and 15 and we ve worn out a Chevy Astro and Plymouth Grand Voyager through the years
Pos,The 95 year had transmission problems and all sorts HOWEVER Only the guy with the 96 has had problems No problem Still comfy for everyone in the van The extra power is very nice and the engine is smoother We ve been completely impressed with all of them The 95 model was the first model year so its sort of understandable My family has rented 3 Windstars a 95 98 and 99 each for over a month First I ll say this The 1995 and to some extent the 96 Windstar SUCKED reliability wise All the vans were very comfortable and the sound systems were excellent important if you are on long trips We used them for long drives we went two days constantly on the highway and also around town The new vans are GREAT Several people I know have Windstars of various vintages 96 97 98 2000 The interior is humungous Every time we rented a Windstar it was used to haul 6 people and luggage on long trips The only complaint was with the 1995 model the air conditioning wasnt not_very not_good not_in not_the not_back not_bench not_However not_this not_was not_completely not_fixed not_in not_the not_98 not_and not_99 not_models not_we not_rented They all had the 3 8L V6 and drove nicely especially the 99 Absolutely nothing went wrong with any of them including the 1995 and we were so impressed that we nearly bought one we decided on a Focus because we dont not_really not_need not_the not_extra not_space not_I not_highly not_reccommend not_the not_Ford not_Windstar not_but not_only not_models not_from not_1997 and on This is the van for families Tips Dont get a Windstar without the 3 8L V6 engine
Pos,We love our Windstar The ride is superb and quiet We especially love that convenience But we didnt not_trade not_in not_because not_of not_any not_problems We have had 2 Ford Windstars in the past 4 years And we ve also done closer trips to Vermont New Hampshire Rhode Island Theres plenty of room for a family and cargo too We traded it in to get a newer model and we are not not_sorry It is so comfortable to travel in We ve been to Niagara Falls Canada Toronto and Montreal also So I have good reason to stay with them Our van also has the automatic sliding door in the right rear When you re bogged down with tons of shopping bags from a shopping day at the mall you really appreciate this feature We are from Massachusetts I have never had any problems to speak of with these vans and love the dependability of them The seats are very comfortable I happen to like Fords anyway Havent had any complaints in the 29 years we ve had them in our family
Pos,We recommend this car with no reservations It even gets better mileage than was advertised We did extensive research and drove every mini van in town The built in TV and VCR are wonderful for the kids The car rides beautifully has lots of room nice features and is generally a perfect car For the first time we have chosen to lease and this is also a good experience This is the fifth mini van that we have owned but the first Ford We love the car So far 3 months we havent found anything about this car that we do not not_like We plan to get another Windstar in 2 years and our lease payment is only 350 per month
Pos,I bought my Bronco in 1999 There is plenty of interior space and seats 5 very comfortably No one has to ask me to move my seat up It was an 89 XLT with only 84 000 miles on the clock and it showed It has a 302 V 8 which is plenty of power for this vehicle You must also be prepared to get 13 18 MPG and even lower in four wheel drive The Bronco is great for someone who needs a dependable powerful and comfortable four wheel drive vehicle at a reasonable price It is 11 years old and runs great sounds great and looks great One thing Broncos tend to do is wander when traveling in a straight line It is not not_recommended not_for not_people not_who not_will not_only not_drive not_it not_around not_town not_Elderly not_people and or people wearing skirts dresses or high heels may have trouble climbing in this vehicle The previous owner towed his RV with this rig I have actually tried to get this tank stuck and had difficulty at doing so with the 33 tires it is equipped with right now As a previously stated this Bronco is a tank The 89 is the same as the 90 which is why I posted it here I bought this vehicle because I was moving to Northern Iowa and I had a 2WD 1986 GMC Sierra Classic with 160 000 on the clock and needed something new for Iowas winter weather This Bronco was a one owner and I paid a fairly reasonable price for it People who dont not_know not_much not_about not_truck not_models not_think not_it not_is not_new
Pos,I have already written an epinion about a 1992 Ford Ranger that I used to own but last week I traded it in for a 1998 model This time I decided to go with the off road package which gave me the 4 0 liter V6 I love the power A few nice emenities are a center counsel five speed tranny larger wheels and tires and a hard tonneau cover Now I cant not_wait not_for not_summer not_to not_take not_the not_boat not_or not_jet not_skis not_out not_One not_draw not_back not_to not_the not_extra not_power is the extra cost of gas I dont not_think not_this not_is not_all not_directly not_due not_to not_the not_larger not_displacement not_though not_now not_that not_I not_have not_a not_little not_power not_im not_putting not_my not_foot not_in not_it not_a not_lot not_more not_as not_well but on the highway its getting right around 20 22 mpg As for how it rides its pretty smooth much better than I had expected out of a truck with an off road package I also like the fact I sit higher than most other traffic that is except for the onslaught of Suburbans and Expeditions I am pretty comfortable driving this truck its a little cramped but tolerable im about average height 6 feet so my legs are bent a little bit but its not not_like not_my not_knees are rubbing on the steering wheel or anything I dont not_think not_I not_can not_say not_enough not_about not_the not_acceleration not_and not_towing not_power not_of not_this not_truck not_I not_love not_it not_After not_driving not_the not_standard not_2 not_3L not_Ranger not_for not_awhile not_it not_sure not_is not_nice not_to not_have not_a not_little not_something not_behind not_the not_gas not_pedal not_again not_Just not_to not_test not_it not_I not_tried not_towing not_my not_dads not_car not_trailer not_with not_my not_moms not_Bravada not_on not_it not_to not_see not_how not_it not_did and it handled it with no problem
Pos,I give this truck a definite thumbs up It is affordable and good looking The Ford Rangers have come a long way since they first were introduced This pickup truck has taken me where I wanted to go and for a reasonable amount of money For someone who is looking for a powerful safe rugged midsize pickup this is the truck I personally would suggest checking out There is nothing in this world that could compare to getting in my truck and taking it wherever I want to It goes when you want it to Thats why I chose this truck Although it is a challenge in the snow I find that the good far more than outweighs the bad It is comfortable but could use a little extra leg room if you ask me To drive this vehicle feels secure Its a safe vehicle and knowing that makes it much easier and more fun to drive
Pos,When I set out to purchase a new auto I did not not_really not_give not_the not_Explorer not_that not_much not_consideration My kid uses them as well to climb up and out of the auto Pleased I got it overall Oh ya last night while driving to work I got a flat I think that engineer who designed the tire changing system never had to USE this system But now after owning it for just over a year I can say that I am truly pleased with it I was impressed with how much you can tow the pulling power of the engine and the stereo is not not_too not_shabby It was a real pain I think that I like SUVs more simply because sitting at a higher elevation you get to see more of the road and it gives you time to mentally digest more information in a timely manner When I was a truck driver this is one thing that I found to be of particular value when driving long hauls I like the seats they have found to be comfortable on long or short drives I think that the side step bars or great for my wife who is a little vertically challenged In my occupation I am sometimes required to bring a lot of gear with me and I kind of wish that the cargo area was bigger but the Explorer is still larger that Chevy I think that while driving at a high rate of speed on the highway the exterior sound is too great to enjoy the stereo I wish Ford did a little bit more to make the auto more to insulate the exterior noise In my occupation I am sometimes required to bring a lot of gear with me and I kind of wish that the cargo area was bigger but the Explorer is still larger that Chevy I think that while driving at a high rate of speed on the highway the exterior sound is too great to enjoy the stereo I wish Ford did a little bit more to make the auto a little bit more to insulate the exterior noise
Pos,The power trailer mirrors are great and the amount of glass in the body lets you see forever almost Our intended uses for this truck include hauling our cattle to market farm chores and occasionally hauling the family around two adults three teenagers and one younger We have driven bumpy roads to test the ride quality as well as the ability of the cd player to withstand bumps without skipping and it passed My wife and I bought a 2000 F250 crewcab a little over a week ago Everything we wanted was not not_on not_the not_vehicle but it was a good compromise We looked at the Ford commercial pamphlet and decided for long life the 6 8 liter V10 and heavy duty automatic transmission would be able to perform the tasks we were buying the truck for It is a stout engine and has torque that becomes available at a lower r p m than the Chevy 6000 V8 Driving home and subsequently I have found the Ford to be quiet with a high quality ride more at home on a car than a truck We sat the kids in an extended cab to check legroom and found that size coming up short When I drive I dont not_care not_for not_kids not_knees not_in not_my not_back not_Once not_we not_had not_decided not_on not_the not_vehicle not_size not_that not_fit not_us not_we not_realized not_only not_Ford not_made not_a not_well not_equipped not_truck not_that not_large The gas mileage is about normal for a truck perhaps slightly better than I had thought for a large engine I enjoy driving this truck it is comfortable and not not_bouncy not_I not_put not_a not_half not_ton not_of not_feed not_in not_the not_back not_and not_didnt not_notice not_any not_difference not_I not_would not_have not_liked not_the not_captains not_chairs not_and not_a not_different not_color but I am happy with the purchase and it looks like it will last for years
Pos,It has a cd player which could be better The interior of the truck is wonderful it is a xlt with all options We have the truck set up with 3 73 rear gears it is not not_a not_four not_wheel not_drive We pull a 19 foot boat weighing in with trailer gas and all of us at about 4500 lbs The truck has an automatic and the v10 engine having 310 bhp and around 450 ft lb torque Its a pulling monster we have now had our v10 F250 for 2 years we bought one of the first 2000s back in October 1999 We have taken the truck on many vacations and it has gotten about 17 miles to the gallon then not not_to not_bad for a 6 8L engine With a roll top cover the bed is virtually waterproof and lockable The truck still runs like there is no weight behind it gas mileage drops from about 15 to 16 to around 12 to 14 depending on speed we have found that about 65 is the best speed to gas mileage ratio The air is ice cold and the heater blows out air hot enough to burn you It relativley quiet inside the main thing you hear is the ten cylinders in front of you working Room in the back is exceptional Room in the front is more then anyone would ever need
Pos,The steering wheel is thick and meaty These gauges can be found in a number of Ford performance automobiles The main power increase came by way of an intercooled Eaton Series II supercharger also found the Jaguar XJR You may want to check out a href content 49617079940 my review on the Dodge Ram a Happy Car Shopping While most owners will not not_utilize not_the not_power not_provided not_in not_the not_Lightning not_the not_Ford not_Lightning not_offers not_amazing not_performance not_attributes The exterior while not not_as not_bold as the 2002 Dodge Ram or any current generation Dodge Ram is much more bold than the regular F 150s The gauges are white giving you that sporty feel while looking at your speedometer rise same gauges that are in the SVT Mustang The Lightning is recommended 100 to anyone looking for an exclusive non off road hot rod production truck Looking to read about another truck The V8 got a special forged steel crankshaft sinter forged alloy rods and special dished alloy 8 4 1 compression pistons A Larger 2 28 dual bore throttle body was also installed Suspension The interior of the F 150 Lightning is very much like the regular F 150s All Lightnings comes with split bench seats with center arm rests and storage bins The drivers position is especially good allowing for easy access to the HVAC controls and all of the gadgetry in the cabin i Exterior Innovation i The stereo system in my test truck was not not_stock not_it not_was not_a not_6 not_speaker not_Alpine not_system but from what I hear they came with excellent sounding stock sound systems In the case of the 1999 F 150 Lightning though the feeling is enhanced With 360 horsepower at your right foot coupled to a silky smooth 4 speed automatic transmission dont not_expect not_a not_boring not_ride There is plenty of room for 3 adults and the seats are very supportive and comfortable to boot Like the regular F 150s for 99 model year the Lightning is very car like in configuration This vehicle may not not_be not_the not_best not_for not_off not_road not_use not_in not_fact not_off not_road not_use is best avoided however this type of a truck is one that will turn heads and burn rubber fair enough trade off Because of how collectible these trucks are the price is actually higher then what they were back in 1999 I have seen F 150 Lightnings go for around 40 000 New these trucks had a MSRP of around 30 000 even i Conclusion i The basic ladder type separate frame as used on all F 150s is retained for the Lightning as is the basic suspension short long arms up front and a leaf sprung live axle out back Modifications include a lower height recalibrated springs modified shocks thicker anti roll bars and some massive four wheel vented disc brakes i Interior Accommodation i The Trition was conceived primarily to deliver a lot of low rev torque 440 lb ft 3 000 RPM with a smaller bore than stroke of 3 60 x 4 22 Realizing that the Lightning buyers would want substantially more horsepower some significant changes were made over its predecessor and its lesser models Hot rod trucks are not not_a not_new not_form not_of not_radical

a regular F 150 or any truck on this planet for that matter The F 150 Lightning comes with side exhaust a very cool feature would have been better if it had dual side exhaust A SVT badge of honor in the rear Huge 18 rims matched with high performance tires and an aggressive nose lets other drivers know this is one serious truck All Ford Lightnings get the practical and convenient opening rear window Red black or white in all three of the available colors the F 150 lightning radiates real aggression and style with its lowered stance and sexy five spoke alloy rims and body extensions In terms of acceleration the 1999 Ford F 150 Lightning is astonishing ripping 0 60 in under 6 seconds and to 100 mph in an estimated 15 2 seconds according to many specs Unlike most trucks where weight and poor aerodynamics come into play at around 80 or so MPH the Lightning pulls far past that Add flat neutral cornering with excellent grip responsive steering and very supportive seats and the mixture is just about perfect for a hot rod show truck SVT special vehicles team selected the 5 4 liter Triton V8 offered in the F 150 and Expedition as the powerplant for the 1999 Lightning Very good idea if you ask me The 4 6 found in the Mustangs would have lacked Torque and power if they would have selected that particular engine
Pos,The ride is comfortable considering its work status The tailgate easily disconnects if necessary nice feature That big V 8 will break the wheels loose quickly and efficiently You can see what I mean about abuse The lack of cruise control is a bigger factor to me than the seats However if your shopping for a personal truck I would recommend a better equipped model The bed is sized to hold most of what we need The build quality is certain to be the same but you dont not_want not_that not_bench not_seat This truck is abused Numerous people drive it for deliveries getting supplies and weekend use This truck has an excellent utility aspect and I would recommend it to any fleet or local shop I utilize a F 150 XL Model through work Its a base model featuring a 5 Speed Titan V 8 and a tape deck The later primarily refers to several flat tires a broken front grill someone bumped on of our bigger trucks and a sheared off Lug on the right rear wheel It equipped with a basic cloth benchseat ive made several day long runs in it and it could be more comfortable but it could be a lot worse However the drive train remains quite solid Considering the base model and I drive it in workboots the thing picks up quite good and breaks loose quite easy Rain is the biggest enemy as with most trucks There is no doubt in my mind it takes a beating I have to say its durability has impressed me Our truck is approaching 40 K in mileage and the only work required has been regular maintenance and self induced
Pos,No more fumbling for keys in the rain We spent the next month searching for a replacement When buying a new vehicle my husband and I have different priorities Of course safety played an important part of our decision and the Windstar consistently ranks among the safest If you want comfort along with reliability in a minivan I highly recommend the Ford Windstar Late in the summer of 1999 my husband and daughter were in an accident that left our 1993 Chevrolet Lumina minivan totaled My concern is generally limited to the passenger area and comfort while he is concerned about what is under the hood The Windstar had everything we wanted and two hours later it was ours I realize that engine power and size are important and my husband is very pleased with that aspect of our new van We both have been very pleased with the minivan we chose a 1999 Ford Windstar After test driving many new and used minivans the first thing I noticed when I got into the Windstar was how well built and sturdy it felt It handled well and was very comfortable I liked how the instrument panel was designed everything was easy to find and clearly labeled I was also impressed with the amount of space there was both leg room and hauling space The rear bench seat can be moved to the center allowing even more space in back I also noticed the arm rest by the window A person in the front seat doesnt need the window down to rest their arm as if it were Every seating position was comfortable and the upholstery and door design were very pleasing to the eye Having the second sliding door is something we wanted as was keyless entry
Pos,This is a very reliable car not not_to not_mention not_its not_performance This is arguably the most popular mini van on the market for good reason ive owned a Ford Winstar for about a year and a half now and have had no real problems to date What car company has the experience that Ford does With Ford you know that you are getting a good quality automobile that will last you for many years to come Everyone who knows something about cars and or anything about the Ford Windstar then they know it is a very praised van 5 star crash test rating what could be more important numerous awards and more This car still has that new car feel when you first test drive it it is very smooth running Another thing that is great about the Ford Windstar is that IT IS A FORD For instance my father just sold his 1988 Ford F 150 which was in perfect condition from the inside the body was somewhat rusted and it turned out to be a bargain from the price he paid for it to last him 12 years with very minimal visits to the shop Back to the Windstar itself If you have a large family or even a small one you cannot not_go not_wrong not_with not_this not_car not_Just not_by not_looking not_at not_you can tell it has family car written all over it Its perfect to take the kids on long trips and the car is very versatile All in all the Ford Windstar is a great car that you and your family will enjoy for a long while
Pos,The drive train for all models is solid if unspectacular If this sounds like a big gold star for the LX you get a gold star All the same equipment is available on each so sooner or later your salesman will have to breakdown and confess the only difference is the chrome trim which mars IMHO the SEs grille and sides It can be loaded up with nearly every available option including a rear passenger stereo set up which has to be the envy of Honda traction control quad seating etc The SEL also harbors Fords hyped but likely high nuisance factor rear sensor array which is supposed to tell you when you are about to back into something but I bet sounds every time a cat swooshes past The 200hp V 6 moves the machine nicely at highway speeds providing for effortless cruising and passing But hey it is a mini van and not not_a not_dragster even though the copious amounts of torque in the low end can come on quick providing a less car like ride than the Odyssey or say the Sienna As dealers are getting rid of Windstars pretty fast and pocketing the several hundred dollars in factory holdback in the process it shouldnt not_be not_too not_hard not_to not_come not_in not_with not_a not_price not_at not_or not_slightly not_above not_invoice not_Couple not_that not_with not_the not_aforementioned not_special not_financing not_and not_anyone not_in not_the not_market not_for not_a not_people not_mover not_needs not_to not_check not_it not_out It looks like the chrome tape you can buy at Pep Boys but evidently some segment of Fords market research showed anything over 25 Gs has to have chrome Next you ll wonder why anybody in their right mind would pop for a top of the line SEL with the garish two tone paint and three spoke wheels which actually look LESS luxurious than the down market Windstar alloys Ford is making it very easy to find a Windstar that fits you First its only real competition this model year is the new Honda Odyssey and good luck finding one of those Second Ford Credit is willing to throw free money at buyers who rate it Third the Windstar can be dressed up in about any configuration imaginable Unless you are buying for some institution you ll skip the base and deal with the LX which comes with the second sliding door Next you ll scratch your head trying to figure out what the difference is between the LX and SE models
Pos,One more important positive part my wife doesnt like to drive big cars in general but really loves this one I live in the Netherlands Europe and bought a new Ford Windstar SEL which comes unfortunately with a 3 0 ltr engine in the Netherlands only We a family of 6 like to go on holidays on long trips like driving to Spain or Southern France occasionally with a trailer caravan In European cities you dont not_have not_much not_parking not_space but with this reverse sensor you can park it anywhere with great pleasure and people watching and admiring you for your craftmanship Also the seat configuration is hard to change with some European cars like Renault or Opel you need only to point to a seat to remove but in Windstar it is real work Of course this car also had minor drawbacks sofar like electric side doors not not_closing not_without not_some not_help not_every not_once not_in not_a not_year and plastic details just falling of but hey nothing is perfect and a Ford isnt not_a not_Ford not_with not_some not_less not_significant not_loose not_parts not_easy not_to not_be not_clicked not_back not_Auto not_Detroit not_is not_French not_for not_selfdestruct When I was in a hurry to get home I drove about 1000 miles from Spain to Netherlands in a consecutive night and day with hardly a pause Under such circumstances you really value the Windstar as a family limo 5 people are just sleeping and I am driving with comfortable seating music on a headphone fan to keep you awake and the small inside rearview mirror to watch over your family in the meantime dragging a fully loaded caravan mobilehome through the rolling hills I have driven Mercedes Volvo Audi Buick and other good cars but like this one most cause driving it doesnt tire you The only thing I dont not_like is that models exist with a bigger engine and I dont not_have not_it not_even not_at not_a not_gasoline not_price not_of not_5 not_dollar not_a not_gallon not_and not_that not_car not_probably not_costing not_as not_much not_as not_50 not_000 not_over not_here not_If not_Ford not_starts not_to not_export not_3 not_8 not_ltr not_models not_to not_Europe not_that not_will not_probably not_be not_my not_next not_one not_next not_year not_or not_so not_One not_other not_thing not_is not_the not_remote not_sensor
Pos,Then we came across the Windstar Much more attractive and private like for the riders In the front seat there is an unbelievable amount of leg room What a van it was very spacious and we got it at a great deal Wehn my parents were looking for a new car they were especially interested in a van Only problem was that they didnt not_know not_which not_one And dont not_worry not_about not_the not_back not_seats not_plenty not_of not_room not_for not_any not_sized not_person not_I not_recommened not_to not_get not_bucket not_seats not_in not_the not_middle not_seating not_area The trunk of the van is also unbelievably huge I couldnt believe it when i saw it So take my advice and go look at a Ford Windstar Whether it be a Quest Sienna Caravan or Windstar First we were interested in the Sienna but they were very hard to find available and they are a heck of a lot of money The seating is very comfortable and the remote door feature is an ideal one for youngsters and elders C mon think about it you know how heavy a Van door is Right Well all you have to do is press onw button and it is opened for you I also recommend that you select the option of no middle console because the van is much more spacious without And you really dont not_need not_it because there is a big bucket type drawer on the fron console
Pos,My wife and I own a 99 WINDSTAR that we bought in Feb 99 and we have had no problems with it at all WE HAD A 97 AND HAVE LEASED FOR THE LAST 5 YEARS FROM FOR WITH ONLY A COUPLE OF PROBLEMS OVER THE LAST 5 YEARS WITH 3 DIFFERENT VANs WHEN WE DID HAVE A PROBLEM FORD FIXED IT THE FIRST TIME IS WAS IN THE SHOP WE WOULD BUY ANOTHER ONE WHEN THIS LEASE IS UP THE RIDE IS GREAT AND IS VERY COMFORTABLE SHE REALLY LIKES TWO SIDE DOORS AND WITH A SET OF TWINS AND TWO OLDER KIDS ITS EASY TO GET IN AND OUT WE HAVE TAKEN SEVERAL TRIPS AND HAS A LOT OF ROOM
Pos,It is so comfortable quiet and spacious I have a Ford Windstar LX 99 The addition of a second sliding door makes the all new Ford Windstar a very good choice in your Minivan In the van I felt very safe knowing that is got quadrouple five star safety ratings very high marks It is the most comfortable quiet and spacious minivan I have ever been in and I was only in the LX model The redesign of this car was a complete success it is larger with more available amenities and the option of a much more powerful engine 3 8L V6 It is priced right at about 20 000 to start and boy it is well worth it I had an early nineties sedan that was much less manuverable than this van and it is three times the size
Pos,Go buy one and you will love it too My insurance went down 15 a month when I purchased it trading in my 95 Dodge Van My insurance agent was as happy as can be because the van comes factory equipped with a passive anti theft system The ride is great there is lots of room for my family and the gear that comes with two kids LOTS I purchased my new Windstar in August of 1999 from Bankston Ford in Frisco Texas I would recommend this vehicle to my best friend Ford continues to put out the highest quality cars and trucks on the road The Windstars safety record speaks for itself If I had to do it all over again I would buy the exact same vehicle 10 times out of 10 If you are in the market for a van that the whole family will love Ford has the van for you I have the Windstar LX which is the middle of the line as far as accessories go and highly recommend it The gas mileage is great for this big of a vehicle also
Pos,This isnt not_as not_bad not_as not_it not_was not_but not_is not_still not_there It was like a dream car it is so pretty and rides really well If the problems are not not_fixed you know where we are going To another dealer It must be the cheap gas well we upgraded to a name brand and the knock is worse My father in law mentioned it rides like a caddy and it does Handles well and everything It has an engine knock that has been checked over and the dealer said that there isnt not_a not_knock We also have been having problems with the transmission slipping again we were told they couldnt duplicate the problem The engine knock is bad from time to time was so bad the other day that it was hard to accelerate It was also one of the safest vehicles on the road at the time Last year 99 we bought the new model Windstar It sits all five of us comfortable and if there are a couple extra people with us they are fine also When we bought this van we had an Aerostar for almost 5 years and loved it It was very reliable and lots of fun to drive We are leasing and in 2 years our lease will be up and we will have to decide whether to buy this van or go on to another vehicle The gas mileage is good and it has taken very little to maintain it It has the highest safety ratings of all cars and this was a huge selling point for us comfortable and safe Both my husband and I were in an awful accident in Italy and dont not_want not_to not_take not_any not_chances not_again not_Well not_now not_what not_I not_dont not_like not_is not_this not_A
Pos,They are not not_without not_their not_glitches If they did they probably wouldnt not_be not_millionaires So I purchased a very clean used 99 Ford Windstar SE with 32 K for 14000 It has comfortable seats a comfortable quiet ride and most of all it is a good value And regular maintenance costs mufflers brakes any other parts you may need are roughly twice the price of parts for domestic vehicles In fact I looked at a used 2000 Odyssey in my area with 40 K that was 27 000 The newer Hondas and Toyotas may be made in USA but usually the parts are made overseas and are subject to import tariffs No one in their right mind should have to pay 2000 to 3000 above MSRP like some dealers are charging for the 2002 Odyssey If it needs a few repairs so be it The extra 13 Grand I would ve had to spend on a similarly used Honda will go a long way to any would be repairs Also a trademark of all my Hondas was a hard uncomfortable seat and a harsh ride that would be a good feel of the road and stiff handling to the Honda fans I drive 400 miles frequently with maybe one stop for gas The thing is going to run for a long time and I didnt not_have not_to not_break not_the not_bank not_to not_get not_one not_Not not_only not_can not_I not_haul not_my not_kids not_with not_the not_Windstar not_I not_have not_money not_left not_over not_to not_put not_a not_little not_away not_for not_their not_college not_fund My second child will be here in a couple of months so I reluctantly had to make the big break from a car to a minivan Would I have liked a Honda Odyssey or Mazda MPV Yes Could I have afforded a Honda Odyssey or Mazda MPV Yes Do I want to afford a Honda Odyssey or Mazda MPV NO It became almost unbearable with a Honda seat sometimes I would be saddle sore the next day Seats may seem like small things to consider but your hiney has a major interaction with your vehicle Most models of the Windstar have the features you most need as do most of the minivans out there that arent the absolute base model It was a simple question of value Getting something that works for not not_much money Lets face it The majority of Post 1980s vehicles are ALL much more reliable than they used to be Ford Chrysler GM etc A hundred thousand miles is nothing these days 250 K is a more realistic goal now You dont not_need not_a not_Honda not_or not_Toyota not_to not_achieve not_that not_anymore not_Furthermore not_ive not_owned not_three not_Hondas not_Two not_Accords not_and not_one not_Civic
Pos,Therefore I stuck some GT logos on the lower front fenders and added the FACTORY spoiler on the top of the rear deck The take off from redlights is a little bit better but if you were looking for tire burners get a Mustang The Aspire is a great little car equivalent with the Bug of the 60s and 70s but with real seatbelts and airbags to boot I have the intent to drive this car for a least 200 000 miles on the first engine and will periodically report the performance and cost of maintenance to Little Red If you have any quirks to comment on im open for discussion I will try to share what I have learned from the parts books and mechanics I have picked up a lot of info this way As a former employee of Ford I found the Aspire as a wonderfully refreshing replacement to the Festiva My first Festiva went about 18 000 miles before the rings came unseated and blew the oil out The Aspire engineers have cured this problem and I have the only GT Aspire that I know of I was with Ford for 22 years and can do just about anything that can be done to a car mechanically speaking The Aspire has the 59 HP Festiva engine otherwise known as a Mazda 121 Cosmo engine and is set up to run on fuel that is subgrade to US unleaded I decided to try an old trick of boring out the throttle body to increase the airflow through the engine and got a little more than I asked for The dyno gives me 64 HP with a decent highway mileage figure of 38 MPG

Pos,The point The old style bench seats give you every possible square inch of seating area The interior was dead quiet no wind or road noise no rattles squeaks groans or vibration The engine was nothing sophisticated cast iron block no computer parts or modules and pre electronic ignition That was the experience of owning and driving one of Detroits huge old style luxury cars Did you have to take your first car in to have its joints lubricated every 3 000 miles Though each manufacturer had its own fleet of flagships all of those cars had one thing in common Luxury If not you re going to learn something Other aspects of the 1974 LTD may also require some deep thought before you buy For those of you who were born after the 70s or were not not_old not_enough not_to not_drive then you missed something special Tune ups and engine maintenance in general are much more frequent than on a modern car Can you handle tune ups every 10 000 miles and oil changes every 2 000 You ll also pay for replacement parts that no longer exist on modern cars and for servicing they dont not_need not_Are not_you not_old not_enough not_to not_remember not_points not_and not_condensors The model I had boasted a 351 cubic inch V 8 It was a smooth running engine but only had moderate horsepower about 170 Cars were like that then not not_like not_cars not_now not_which can give you 200 horsepower in a 200 cubic inch engine Likewise the trunk is huge easily swallowing a dozen or more bags of groceries plus two spare tires or enough luggage for a whole family Naturally a car this old has its quirks though they werent seen that way when it was built because it had the technology of its day and not not_the not_21st not_century In fact there were several times during my ownership that the radiator failed completely yet I drove for miles without knowing the cooling system had broken down simply because the car didnt not_overheat not_Ride not_quality not_was not_fantastic not_nothing not_upset not_this not_cars not_poise not_not not_bumps not_railroad not_tracks not_potholes or debris Driving on the expressway at speed was like floating in complete isolation of the road And by the way theres no fuel injection in this car its got a carburetor Still theres nothing like driving a car like this with a hood thats long enough to be the prow of a yacht and a cabin thats big enough to be the command room of a battleship Such cars may never again be built by American industry but this essay is in remembrance to the times in which they were The cars power will do for everyday driving including emergency passing but you ll never burn any rubber Fuel costs to run this car may seem preposterous but remember it was built when regular unleaded sold for 43 cents a gallon Suffice it to say that even with the smallest V 8 the 351 which was advertised as an economy engine then you ll get about 10 miles per gallon city and about 14 miles per gallon highway That only enhanced listening

Pos,Good use of room The front seats are comfortable for longer drives The 4WD mode is superb in the white stuff The anti lock brakes are better than the average The tilted up seat does not not_provide not_that not_much not_more not_room The quality of this vehicle is truly first rate There are grab handles for all 4 outboard passengers Mechanicals It comes with massive 4 wheel disks and does a good job stopping quick The folded down shelf is useless because anything placed on the self slides right off This being my third Ford I like my controls predictable so I am very happy with the interior ergonomics The rear cargo area is cavernous and the pull down handle on the rear door is nice All in all this is one fantastic vehicle and I will probably buy another one in a few years The premium sound system not not_the not_Mach not_system lacks low end bass I fixed that with an add on sub The controls are standard Ford 3 rotary dials for climate cruise control on the steering wheel and minimal usage of steering wheel stalks The step up bumper allows easy access should you need to actually get in the cargo area The second row seat allow 3 adults to sit without touching one another or the seat backs in front of them In checking out the wildly popular line of Chrysler minivans I found roomy vehicles but a lot of wasted room Not so with the Expedition The handling is great for something so large and the ride is exceptionally smooth for what is essentially a dressed up pickup The electronic AWD 4WD works perfectly and is easy to use and understand although it is a little close to the ventilation knob both in distance and shape In all fairness I have taken some roadway dips at higher speeds and never actually bottomed out This might all be a perception thing on my part Seating We need to start with the model I own The XLT with Appearance Package Several of my comments relate to features found in this model The console is fantastic the cup holders LARGE and enough little storage areas to please a pack rat I would ask for more storage in the cargo area though The good point being that the receiver is capable its just the amp that is lacking The cargo area needs a net and some hooks to keep things in place The AWD system is not not_the not_best not_in not_the not_world not_producing not_noticeable not_slippage not_in not_snow not_However not_Ford not_compensated not_for not_this not_by not_adding not_in not_the not_unusual not_option not_of not_allowing not_a not_4WD not_mode The ride and power is comparable to other SUVs Remember I have the 5 4 In test drives I found the 4 6 to be underpowered which is not not_true not_for not_the not_F150 not_Pickup This being my 6th AWD 4WD vehicle I prefer 4WD in snow I refer you to the motto Transfers power from the wheels that slip to the wheels that grip My tire place tells me that the wheels are designed so that it is hard for balancing weights to stay on This is not not_normal but I like the distinct look of the wheels This is coming from someone who has had their vehicle broken into because of what was visible in the cargo area I got the 5 4 V8 and it gets about 12 MPG The steering wheel is large and cushioned and feels good in your hands I really like the CD changer being accessible in the center console yet still having plenty of room left for stuff try that with a smaller car The vehicle definitely looks cooler with it out Now on to the many many good points Design Room Room Room I am 6 4 and no part of this vehicle comes even close to any part of me shoulders head etc The key point is that some slipping must be going on When this is done well see my epinion on the Subaru Outback then you dont not_notice not_in not_the not_Expeditions not_case not_it not_is not_not not_done not_well but the 4wd mode compensates No normal feature of a car should require two people to use it They tried to compensate by allowing the seat to be folded into a shelf or tilted up Both of these features are nothing more than marketing My biggest gripe is that the cargo area does not not_come not_with not_a not_cover and there is no aftermarket ones available I fault Ford for not not_adding not_two not_little not_pieces not_of not_plastic not_into not_the not_sides not_that not_would not_have not_allowed not_me not_to not_add not_one My comment here is dont not_kid not_yourself not_if

not_Something not_is not_not not_right not_because not_my not_wheels not_require not_balancing not_every not_5000 not_miles If you ve done your research you know that there is 4 feet between the wheel wells allowing for sheets of building materials Everything seems to be solid no thin plastic parts check out the console on a Blazer for an example of cheap plastic parts While I feel that this vehicle is tough enough to take off road see my Subaru Outback epinion I found the suspension to be a little spongy for off roading When combined with the tremendous weight of this thing I suggest keeping it on the pavement The new line of GM full size SUVS seems to have dealt properly with this feature by allowing two separate seats I tend to keep my seat removed and only put it back in when I have a lot of people to move One interesting note is that there seems to be so much power and low end torque that extra weight in the car seems to have little effect I have had 800 lbs of passengers and could not not_tell not_from not_the not_way not_the not_vehicle not_handled not_and not_accelerated The 3rd row seat is good for smaller people I have had kids back there and they actually enjoy it kind of like riding in the back of the station wagon when you were a kid In 14 months of ownership I have not not_had not_a not_single not_problem The 3rd row seat while improved over previous years is still a pain in the butt to get in and out It is heavy and bulky and I always strain my back dealing with it Yes the manual says use two people but I dont not_happen not_to not_have not_an not_official not_seat not_moving not_helper not_on not_staff not_at not_the not_moment The Appearance Package provides step bars instead of running boards Being tall I dont not_like not_any not_step

Pos,The back seats are even comfortable It handles and rides like a car It was perfect and it opened my eyes That is where the posi trac rear end comes in handy The seating is more comfortable than any SUV we had previously driven and the adjustable pedals are a blessing We opted for the 2 wheel drive model as we live in Arizona and dont not_venture not_much not_in not_snow The automatic locking doors are perfect for keeping small children in tow while trying to remove groceries and such The third row seats are fine as long as you dont not_try not_to not_put not_a not_6 not_tall not_person not_back not_there not_a not_teenager not_or not_two would fit back there comfortably I personally never owned or liked Fords until my husband and I went shopping for vehicles I was a GMC kind of gal and was really looking more at the GMC Suburbans The only thing I dont not_like not_about not_this not_SUV is the small amount of space behind the 3rd row seats I guess that is why there is a luggage rack on top My husband is a Ford fanatic and has owned Fords all his life I didnt not_like not_his not_F not_150 because of the leather seats and even though it was a 3 door it was too small for us and his 3 kids This feature also keeps the curious kids from accidently opening the door while the vehicle is moving An excellent choice in my book Lots of other features and goodies are available but my advice would be to test drive one and fall in live with it on your own It senses slipping and the posi trac kicks in Hubby really liked that feature and was glad to have had it while going up through the Colorado mountains I think this is the perfect car for families wanting to travel in comfort or for people wanting to start a family sometime soon On this trip we went into a dealership and I was looking around while he arranged some maintenance for his pick up I actually liked the look of the Expedition and was asked if I would like to test drive it I said sure knowing my heart was set on a Suburban I LOVE the way the Expedition handles and the comfort level while driving
Pos,The Expedition is a dream to drive handles well and the gas mileage is reasonable We went to all of the differant dealers in the area and checked out the Dodge Durango the Jeep Grand Cherakee Chevrolet Blazer GMC Jimmy and Tahoe My wife is 5 2 and runs the pedals all the way up and I like to have the lowest pedal setting A touch of a button is all it takes She immediatly locked on to a gold XLT and the Durango was forgotten A test drive cinched the deal Since then we have taken a 1200 and a 600 mile trip experiencing all types of weather each time We then went to the Ford Dealer to see an Explorer before we went back to make a deal on the Duango While walking across the lot to the Explorers my wife spotted the Expeditions We looked at the Excursion while we were at the Ford dealer but it was just too big for us Try one on for size and I ll bet you will be the next buyer In November of 1999 my wife decided that she was interested in an SUV and wanted to trade in our 1997 Dodge Ram I had bought a 1999 Jeep Wrangler for myself earlier in the year so who was I to argue We have the small V8 and power is not not_lacking not_When not_we not_fold not_up not_the not_third not_seat not_we not_have not_all not_of not_the not_room not_we not_need and if we remove the third seat and fold the second seat the space approximates that of a pickup Long objects like lumber fit on the roof rack We get about 15 mpg in the city and about 18 on the highway I have owned a good many vehicles in my time including a new Cadillac Sedan Deville and this is my all time pick for comfort Safety is another factor as you sit nice and high and the Expedition has a nice heavy secure feel We have added tinted window vents about 40 tinted front windows about 70 and a K amp N air filter about 55 When backing the vehicle seems longer than it is and the rear window being up so high makes it appear that vehicles and objects behind you are closer than they are One special luxury that we enjoy is the power operated adjustable gas and brake pedal The only item I wish that it had was the memory settings for the seat adjustments but we can live without them All in all Ford has a winner with the Expedition the comfort of a luxury car while giving more room for passengers and cargo I had doubts at first about getting rid of our pickup because it was so handy but no more I am sold on the Expedition
Pos,You can drive it ar snowy rainy days without dangerous It is better than Lincoln Navigator and Dodge Durango Because It is an excellent car More roomy than Durango and strong than Navigator ENGINE V8 The current V8 gives out 260hp I feel more which are adequate numbers for adequate engine performance When I see a Ford Expedition on the street I decide for buy it Because it was excellent It is more powerfull than Durango cheap than Navigator and has same luxury whic I buy a Eddie Bauer 4x4 Fully Loaded My main gripe with the engine is the sub par fuel economy Even for an SUV the Expedition especially 4WD models I hear seemed excellent The Expedition uses an on demand 4 wheel drive system and can be shifted from 2 wheel drive into 4 wheel drive while the vehicle is in motion Maximum towing capacity is 8000 lbs We could feel the power draining a bit when we loaded the truck with people however Still the shifts are smooth and the power curve is evenly proportioned throughout acceleration The rather not not_small not_gasoline not_tank is not not_to not_blame not_for not_frequent not_fill not_ups not_I not_would not_not not_recommend not_the not_4 not_6 not_235 not_hp not_8 not_cylinder not_that not_is not_also not_offered not_Manual not_transmissions not_are not_not not_available not_for not_either not_engine not_selection not_although not_automatics not_are not_far not_more not_popular
Pos,We purchased the Expedition XLT Sport edition in Jan 2000 upgraded engine cloth seats upgraded running boards 6 disc CD player We have 4 kids 3 of which are still in some form of carseat booster seat So when we went shopping for a larger vehicle one major requirement was being able to seat 3 carseats alongside one another without any complications We only spend about 40 a month on gas price being about 1 60 gal in N Calif because we only drive places a couple times a week as a family We solved the space issue in the Expedition by folding down the two middle row seats leaving the 3rd seat behind the front passenger seat up and being used then placing the other 3 kids in the back row My only real complaint is the lack of storage if you are putting more than 5 people into this car I still think that once we re ready to trade this vehicle in im going to push for the Excursion or possibly a Suburban In many cars vans and even some SUVs its almost impossible to do that without having one carseat pushed up against the other to the point where the seats dont not_sit not_evenly not_Amazingly not_enough not_we not_were not_able not_to not_put not_all not_3 not_carseats not_in not_without not_any not_trouble not_at not_all This freed up a bit more usable area for groceries or the stroller Overall ive been happy with it I like the fact that the drivers seat is adjustable as are the brakes because im only 5 5 Its been an easy vehicle to drive unlike some of the minivans ive owned before ie Dodge Grand Caravan the Pontiac Transport and it actually doesnt drive like a large vehicle The other problem we faced was my husband his height Hes 6 6 That leaves a lot of cars out of the running because hes either scrunched up in the drivers seat with his knees hitting the steering wheel or his head is hitting the interior ceiling Personally I favored the design of the Dodge Durango but alas my husbands head not not_only hit the ceiling but if it had had a sunroof his head would ve been out of the car After looking at the Fords I really wanted the Excursion because of the extra storage space but my husband was concerned about the gas mileage Moot point in the end because he works from home therefore no commute
Pos,It is so much more convenient then a compact car My family has been a Ford family for the past 40 years if not not_longer My mother has owned a expedition for 3 years now so we were not not_really not_getting not_into not_something not_new She has had no problems with her expedition and we hope that we will have no problems either My husband and I have just purchased a 2000 Ford expedition earlier this month we are expanding our family and needed a bigger vehicle to fit our family and our belongings The third seat in the back is a great idea it can be removed if we need the space or it can be used for extra passengers This is a great car truck SUV what ever you want to call it it is comfortable to drive and easy to ride in so now I cant not_wait not_until not_our not_next not_long not_road not_trip We went from a dodge stratus to the expedition and in the car we could not not_have not_anyone not_ride not_with not_use not_so not_if not_we not_want not_to not_go not_some not_where not_with not_some not_one not_we not_would not_have not_to not_take not_at not_least not_two not_cars and that got pathetic
Pos,What a package So far this is where my baby has shined The controls are intuitive and well placed none have ever broken on me When new the published 0 60 times on this car were in the high 7s low 8 second region This allowed me to surprise many Taurus Olds Cutlass and Chevy Lumina owners at stoplights That was faster than many cars twice its size mostly because they were twice its size The A C is ICE cold still a good freon system not not_the not_lukewarm not_R134a not_system my wife has in hers The interior is sparse the cupholders good dash has usable space plastic is hard not not_great but not not_tacky either The logic behind this is that all of those things add weight which would slow the car down The only thing I wish I had was a quick little wrist shifting car like a Miata or Toyota MR2 The stiffness that makes for such good handling translates into so so ride comfort A little tire noise and bounciness over bumps is tolerable The stereo is good though again its speakers are odd sizes that are only slightly more difficult to replace with aftermarket than usual For the money some of the cheapest fun you can have on the road Good looks great performance solid reliability tough to beat in its class The dealership did a bang up job of putting it back together and it has tracked straight as an arrow ever since RIDE 6 Well tallying it up it looks like the average score for my little pocket rocket is solid 8 0 even though shes a 10 in my heart All in all for 150 000 miles I have had nothing but trouble free driving pleasure from this car and isnt not_that not_what not_its not_all not_about not_OVERALL No tranny clutch problems a LITTLE tiny bit of oil leakage finally the last few months what do you expect after almost 150 K all original hoses belts brake lines master cylinder suspension cables etc The car feels light and tossable in corners yet tracks straight at speed Stiff spring and shock rates coupled with wide tires make this thing hang on tenaciously in turns The one feature that I am continually AMAZED at is the amount of cargo space I have if I fold the rear seats and load from the hatchback This car is cavernous I haul to the dump carry lumber have moved twice with it it just has a ton of room for such a small car RELIABILITY MAINTENANCE 10 The only problem I have is that the car is geared relatively low for quick acceleration and so cruising at 75 mph it is turning between a fairly noisy 3500 4000 rpm The upside to this is if you mash the pedal even at 80 mph the engine is right in the sweet spot of the torque curve and surges forward nicely HANDLING 8 Again excellent in a car so priced The seats are comfortable for me but in all honesty not not_the not_greatest not_for not_long not_hauls not_but not_the not_side not_bolstering is good and adjustments are easy with a lot of room if you re tall and up closeness if you re short My solution after 100K miles was to switch up safely to 195 60s which are available in more and cheaper brands TRANSMISSION 8 Shifts just fine not not_crisp but not not_sloppy even after 146 000 miles never been replaced original clutch effort is light The A C compressor just went on me this week July 2000 and will need replacing I put new plug wires on it 5 yrs ago and I think I had one small leak quickly sealed around the rear window when I first got it One small niggling problem I feel like I have replaced a lot of headlights and foglights but what is that 10 or so for a bulb My wife talks on and on about her Civics superior quality but here is a stone cold fact my car has virtually no repair history to speak of No kidding And this car has 146 000 miles on it Replaced the timing belt at 100 K the 90 degree elbow off the exhaust manifold finally rusted through 6 months ago I replaced it but the all stainless pipes from the flex pipe back is all original I mentioned tires and brakes going quickly due to my driving habits This review comes about mostly as a rebuttal to my wife who insists on comparing her car a 1995 Honda Civic DX to mine 1993 Ford Escort GT Let us take a look at the individual parts and then the Gestalt whole shall we ENGINE 9 Possibly the strongest reason for buying the car Mazdas 1 8L DOHC pushes out 127 hp and it does so pretty effortlessly Willing to rev the secret formula is that the engine feels so strong because the car is so darn light There is one large BEWARE however Lift throttle induced oversteer can be extreme when cornering hard I personally enjoy it because I can flick the tail out easily when im in the mood but to the novice or inattentive watch out My wife was driving with me in the rain about 8 weeks after I bought my baby and she let off the gas mid turn on a wide sweeper and the tail came right around sending us grinding across a low stone wall taking out the entire undercarriage almost 9 K damage The lightness comes at the expense of not not_having not_much not_sound not_deadening not_insulation not_I not_do not_have not_to not_say not_I not_have not_gone not_through not_3 not_sets not_of not_brake not_pads but I drive pretty hard and this may be normal wear for 146 K miles I also seem to go through tires pretty fast which may also have to do with my relatively aggressive style sidenote OEM tire size is 185 60R15 and the ONLY tire made in that size is the OEM Goodyear

matched the cars paint color I ended up with the silver alloy wheels and I think they look even better Its no vette but it still looks better than a Tercel or Corolla or even my wifes Civic anyday

Pos,But other then that it is not not_a not_bad not_little not_car not_if not_you not_are not_looking not_for not_a not_beater not_to not_get not_back not_and not_forth not_to not_work The only other downfall is that is has aluminum heads on it and if you overheat the car once you will most likely crack the heads And they get great gas mileage about 30 miles to the gallon I would recommend this car to anyone that is looking of cheap transportation This is a nice little car but when i say little i mean it You could not not_fit not_four not_good not_sized not_guys not_in not_this not_cars not_it not_would not_come not_apart not_at not_the not_seems
Pos,The engine noise is very muted It also breaks quickly The 2000 Ford Escort looks and feels nice inside The windows go up and down quickly and quietly No having to push buttons back and forth The rear columns are thin meaning less blind spots This is where the 2000 Ford Escort impressed me the most But you probably want to know how does it drive It cruised well at 75 and is a very quiet car inside In a hurry we threw all the suitcases in the back seat of the car The seats are comfortable and you have a good view of the road The steering wheel is pretty thick My Dodges is a little thicker but its still formidable The window and lock controls are firm and sturdy the gear shifter well made and sturdy in your hand So I called Hertz and said I want the cheapest car I can get If Hertzs cheapest car is the Ford Escort anyone who pays for an upgrade is just throwing away money If I were still in college and had had a chance to drive this car I would have wanted one The other rentals felt plasticky with snap together pieces that didnt not_always not_fit not_well not_All not_of not_the not_climate not_and not_radio not_controls not_are not_easily not_reachable not_by not_both not_the not_driver not_and not_passenger The car handles very well Its steering is crisp and its acceleration is amazing im used to a much heavier car and I was incredibly surprised at how quickly this car accelerated The radio sounds clear and the air conditioner blasts cold air pretty well Whats really cool is that the radio displays the time and the radio station at the same time I discovered yesterday that it would be cheaper for me to rent a car than it would be to take a taxi or shuttle to get home It looked like it had decent legroom I got into the car and immediately noticed how it different from other rentals ive had several 98 and 99 Chevrolet Cavaliers and a 1998 Ford Escort Disclaimer ive also rented a 1999 Jeep Wrangler but these are for two different types of uses They set me up in a Champagne colored Ford Escort A rather nice looking vehicle For day to day use I like larger cars like my Dodge Intrepid But I simply needed to get from point A to point and then briefly to point C to drop the car off so I wanted something with four wheels and an engine
Pos,My best friend had just recently purchased a Ford ZX2 The ZX2 is such a blast to drive and the handling is outstanding Maneuvering through traffic is no problem with this peppy little four banger When I found out that he had traded his Camaro for this small gas saver I was greatly disappointed in him But my opinion changed when he was telling me about how little it cost him and how great it was on gas I was starting to get interested What I like the most about this car is its ability to get up to speed quickly its comfortable and sporty interior and its dual airbags make this a safe dependable low maintenence car for anyone who wants to save money and have something sporty at the same time I highly recommend going to the dealer and at least taking one of these for a test drive He invited me for a ride in his new car and I accepted As soon as I sat in the comfortable seat i fell in love For a small car it rode like it was at least 20 000 with a 6 cylinder motor under the hood But that was just the beginning We drove for about a half an hour and i was surprised when he asked me if I wanted to drive it I accepted in an instant I got behind the wheel and off we were
Pos,My husband and I bought an 85 wagon two years ago I feel that you can not not_go not_wrong not_buying not_a not_Ford not_Escort not_whether not_your not_buying not_it not_brand not_new not_or not_used We also purchased an 87 Escort about six months ago To our surprise it had the original factory oil filter tran filter spark plugs and wires We decided to drive it until it blew up Well guess what it is still running like a champ The same parts for twelve years I have never heard of any other car running on the original parts Ford has definitely won us over We dont not_plan not_on not_purchasing not_another not_vehicle not_any not_time not_soon but if we where to buy one it most certainly will be a Ford Escort It had 130 000 miles on it when we got it and now has about 300 000 miles on it We ve taken it on several road trips stuffed several people in it and loaded it down the groceries We also had an awesome Pioneer system in it that should have in all reality should have shook the car apart A couple of time we with a month or so over on oil changes and never had a problem with it Eight months ago we discovered that the head gasket was blown
Pos,I bought my Ford Escort ZX2 in November 1999 It was the first new car that I ever bought There is no other size that fits on the rims I went to 4 different tire dealers looking for cheaper tires Id previously purchased used cars I didnt not_do not_a not_good not_job not_comparison not_shopping and ended up paying more for it than I should have p These 79 tires lasted only a few months I went to another tire dealer who told me it may be possible to get different rims He looked in a junkyard for me and found 4 rims for 60 yes used BUT I was able to then get normal sized tires at only 35 each The lowest I found was 79 00 per tire plus installation p Since 2 of my tires were bad and the other two had a lot of wear I replaced all 4 tires The big drawback of all this is now I have ugly rims black with no chrome on my car that I should now paint p All in all I do love my car The only drawback that ive found with this car is the price of the tires Ford Motor Company decided to use a certain size tire on these cars and Goodyear is the ONLY manufacturer of this particular size The car is great I love the way it runs the way it looks and the way it sounds I get about 28 miles per gallon and thats so important with todays gas prices p
Pos,My wife and I are on our second Ford Ranger The jump seats come in handy when taking on unexpected riders We also got the four door option which is also very convenient The space that you get behind you seat is worth the expense But the Ford dealership that we went to forgave the mileage when we got our new one The Ford Ranger is a very good vehicle and I recommend it to anyone We leased our first one two and a half years ago We ve found that the Ranger is tough and reliable Not a thing has gone wrong with either Ranger that we ve owned The Ranger that we currently have is an extended cab model which I highly recommend My only complaint with my 99 is that I wish I had gotten a bigger engine as my new one is under powered Leasing frightens a lot of consumers we have found that there is nothing to be afraid about it The first Ranger that we leased went over the given mileage by twenty thousand miles
Pos,The Ranger doesnt have too much room in the interior And a person who depended on a truck for business would probably want a long bed But for my needs it is super It also had a 6 cylinder engine which was strongly recommended over a 4 cylinder by my male relatives and trusted mechanic im really glad I spent the extra money and brought this truck It is easy to drive and I feel secure in it Its isnt as high off the road as the Bronco was but enough height to feel I have adequate vision It was very difficult to find anything to meet my needs most trucks were standard transmission and had high mileage Finally one of the dealers called they had just gotten in a new 1999 Ranger XL which met my needs I had been driving an 1987 Ford Bronco selected by my husband who wanted a big vehicle which was slowly rusting away over the last few years and beginning to have some mechanical woes I started out shopping for a used small truck with automatic transmission I didnt not_particularly not_want not_a not_4x4 although had gotten out of some situations with the Broncos 4 wheel capabilities I looked on line in classifieds and at local car dealers My son who is quite a bit taller feels that his left arm is cramped against the door I recently added a cap and feel this makes the truck feel more solid now For example when I crossed train tracks the rear of truck would bounce Now it holds the road better I also added a floor mat and that seems to have made it a quieter ride I think the a c and heater are really great and do their jobs well the radio has good quality sound I have a cassette player which I like as I often listen to speakers on tape I would recommend this truck to someone who wants a vehicle for every day use I think it would be a uncomfortable for a large person
Pos,We have the extended cab flared sides 6 cylinder and it gets excellent gas mileage No question in my mind about that This is not not_a not_large not_family not_vehicle not_for not_certain My husband has always wanted a new truck and last year we went searching for a new vehicle But anyone who wants a truck for the smaller hauling jobs or trailer towing this is perfect In fact it does about the same as my little car and we can haul with this baby This was a terrific deal and the saleswoman and entire staff were easy to deal with and it is very fast getting regular maintenance appointments with our local dealership We waited until the end of the year clearance time and we found it We got in on a Ford red carpet lease at 3 4 interest For real You can easily allow two children to safely ride in the jump seats but they would have to be small children and I would not not_suggest not_a not_long not_trip not_because not_they not_would not_not not_be not_comfortable We put a hitch on it and took it to the home improvement store with our trailer on the back and it rode so smoothly you would never know that you had a trailer in tow This is also great to go shopping with put your large purchases easily in the body of the truck and you still have plenty of room for your groceries behind the seat I do it all the time It handles terrific and the paint job just gleams in the sun after being actually almost two years old We have had no problems with this truck and IF we dont not_buy not_it not_at not_the not_end not_of not_the not_lease not_we not_will not_jump not_into not_another not_one We are used to towing behind a Suburban so that is saying a lot The only thing I would change is that I would have more room in the extended part for seating but I know that is really not not_what not_the not_truck not_was not_designed not_for not_Driving not_this not_vehicle is as smooth as driving a car
Pos,It looks so much better The sound system is awesome The passenger airbag can be disengaged Good feature It came equipped with driver airbag and passenger airbag This is a very sporty truck that lacks no power This is my first NEW auto purchase as I have always preferred buying used So if you are looking for a truck take a look at the Ranger No problem I have the off road package 4 wheel drive with the skid plates on the transmission My hardest decision was whether to get the flarebed or straightbed I went with the flarebed It is a very comfortable ride with minimal windnoise I have had it in the mud and snow on several occasions The ONLY setback is the bed inside to inside is not not_48 not_wide not_I not_understand not_that not_we not_are not_all not_different not_and not_have not_different not_needs My truck is loaded with the exception of the power package which consists of power doors locks and mirrors I am very satisfied with this purchase It has the 3 0 engine as I dont not_need not_the not_4 not_0 not_which not_has not_a not_few not_more not_hp not_and not_less not_mpg not_I not_have not_no not_problem not_pulling not_a not_boat not_with not_this not_truck not_I not_have not_the not_automatic not_with not_overdrive not_transmission The Ranger was the best small truck I test drove and had the best overall looks I know performance comes first and it performs trust me on this I love the way this truck handles on and off road I had a 89 Ranger up until 9 months ago I finally decided to look for something newer I also have a Bronco so I was already set on a Ford product After going from lot to lot town to town I finally found just what I was looking for The truck I bought is a 99 XLT Ranger 4X4 Supercab quadcab
Pos,We bought the 1999 Ford Ranger for our daughter The cab is small but thats okay with us too She was headed off to college and needed reliable safe and affordable transportation We havent had one misgiving since purchasing it over a year ago This ensures she wont have loads of passengers with her My husband liked the idea of a vehicle with a full body frame I like the idea of the dual airbags The truck bed has come in handy especially when she moved all of her belongings away to go to college The 4 cylinder engine doesnt use up excessive amounts of gasoline making it a vehicle she can afford to drive We purchased the Ranger with Fords 0 9 financing With a little homework we discovered that we actually saved money buying her a brand new Ranger rather than the 1996 we had first considered We bought the basic model which included only a cassette player radio but no air conditioning Hey we were buying her a vehicle what more could she ask for My husband likes the idea that with a 4 cylinder she doesnt get a great deal of pick up when accelerating I just like the idea that it starts every time she turns the ignition whether in the heat of summer or sub zero winter temperatures
Pos,The interior is comfortable but not not_plush This is the first time I can honestly say I love my vehicle When I drive more responsibly I can get 20 MPG out of the truck although 18 19 MPG is the norm She refused to give up the Mazda and I realized this was the perfect truck for a 40 something Mom who never had anything so cute Whats more the 4 0 L engine allowed it to pull a horse trailer with horse I bought the truck used with 100 miles on it from a man who had won it at the local Ford dealership It was 15 MPG in the very beginning but increased as the truck broke in Unfortunately this truck has Firestone Wilderness HT tires and ive already made Firestone replace one for free when it was almost bald at 12 000 miles despite recommended rotations and balancing When I first saw this bright red 1999 Ford Ranger XLT Sport with aerodynamic striping I thought it would be the perfect vehicle for my teenage daughter Id bought her a 1999 Mazda B3000 Cab Plus 4 pickup three months earlier and assumed this adorable truck would steal her heart and give ME the stodgier four door Mazda truck It had never been titled or registered and was covered with the stickers of the local radio station which had sponsored the contest Luckily they came off easily I must admit that the powerful roaring 4 0 L engine has brought out the teenager in me and I sometimes just cant not_help not_leaving not_everyone not_behind not_when not_the not_traffic not_light not_turns not_green The seats are a mixture of a tweed like material with a little velour thrown in Very adequate I wish I had an extended cab but ive learned to simply take all the junk ive accumulated out of the truck each weekend I knew I never needed to keep that gallon of windshield washer fluid with me all the time but now I KNOW I cant They gave me a big talk about different qualities of rubber but I know I ll be replacing all four tires within the year After one year ive had no problems whatsoever and have not not_even not_visited not_the not_dealer not_ive not_changed not_the not_oil not_myself and had the rotations balancing done at the local Tire Kingdom I have another 20 000 miles warranty but hope I never meet the service department of the local Ford dealership
Pos,You surely would not not_want not_to not_make not_someone not_travel not_back not_there not_for not_long The only downfall that i have found is that the seats in the extended cab area are tight This past summer i bought my 1999 Ford Ranger extended cab off road truck I am pleasantly surprized with its options and handling ability My truck is fully loaded with all the options and is manuel and i love it It handles great on all the turns and since it is a V 6 i have plenty of power for all my needs The 4x4 is great in the winter and whenever i am hauling or off roading If you are looking for a truck that isnt not_huge but has all the power you would need the Ranger is the way to go The ride is quite smooth considering it is a pick up
Pos,This truck is built FORD TOUGH And all of them are wonderful There is a ranger for every price range I have a 1999 Wedgewood Blue ext cab 4 door automatic ranger The other car hit me pretty hard and my damage was minimal This truck is worth every cent that I paid for it 19 998 The only thing that I dont not_like not_about not_this not_truck is the color that I picked This isnt not_really not_a not_family not_truck but what truck is If you have long legs or a large build you will not not_be not_comfortable not_in not_the not_back not_seat The gas mileage could be a little better but if you want better mileage i would recommend a standard v 4 which is what i had before this truck It gets dusty where I live and my truck is constantly dirty A ranger is a great vehicle for anyone but since it is so easy to handle on the road its a wonderful first car It has a v 6 engine and its fully loaded I love this truck Not only is it the best looking truck i have seen in a long time it is so nice I would rather be in it than anywhere else This truck has great features like a switch to turn passenger side air bags off and on some extended cabs come with 4 doors which makes getting in and out alot easier mine can run on ethanol fuel and everything else that you can think of This truck is also safe I was recently in an accident
Pos,My sister has had to replace the engine and transmission on hers but its been driven rough Treat this car good and it will be a joy Not to mention mine came with the climate control that allows you to control the temperature of the car so its REALLY a joy to drive no matter what its like outside My T bird has been a great car so far Everyone who has driven it has commented on how smooth it drives and how well it handles the road Rain and snow are not not_a not_problem not_this not_car not_is not_built not_for not_all not_weather not_conditions The only problems ive had have been that the vacuum hose disconnected itself somehow but that caused minimal problems mainly it just made an annoying sound I need new engine mounts right now but I attribute that to the roads in this area my husband just had all 4 replaced on his car I love the options on my car and its good for getting the baby car seat in and out Its great for local driving or roadtrips
Pos,Not just things but you can fit several people in there and still have a comfy ride I am a proud owner of a Ford Explorer I received this car about 3 years ago and would not not_trade not_it not_for not_the not_world not_An not_Explorer not_can not_fit not_tons not_of not_stuff not_in not_it trust me I fill it to the brim everytime I go back to college In fact the Explorer is so comfy I can drive 4 hours without having to stop and stretch The Explorer has electric seats which makes it perfect for any size person to drive because it so easy to adjust Gas goes a long way as well granted it is expensive to fill up but once you do you wont have to for a while An Explorer is dependable and sturdy Over Thanksgiving I was rear ended by a car that was rear ended by a mack truck and there was no damage done Rarely do I need to take my car in for anything other than an oil change I know when this Explorer dies the next car I will get will be an Explorer
Pos,This vehicle is not not_made not_just not_for not_good not_looks This vehicle is for someone who wants to run their car haul and off road This vehicle is great for riding tough I change the oil regularly and the air filter maybe once a year I bought my Ford Explorer in 1993 when they werent the station wagon of the 90s I have a dirt road 1 3 mile long with lots of ruts and bumps I haul pot bellied pigs and my dog straw heavy food bags and drive on the lawn My Explorer has lasted with general maintenance and new tires
Pos,It even tows very well I towed my brothers boat 400 miles with absolutely no problems It handles great with no real problems and putting it in 4 wheel drive is easy just push a button I bought my 1993 Ford Explorer because I wanted a bigger vehicle to haul around all my and my brothers stuff For hauling its great My biggest problem is that in the winter im from Iowa this vehicle does not not_stop not_very not_well not_on not_snow not_or not_ice not_Unlike not_most not_vehicles not_that not_may not_slide not_slightly not_my not_Explorer not_is not_all not_over not_the not_road You have to start stopping over a block before the stop sign Anyone is fair weather climate should have no problems with this vehicle Its great for hauling all of your things and towing your boats etc and it gets around great
Pos,Three years ago we traded it for a custom van I miss my Ford Explorer so much A few years ago we bought a Ford Explorer used at the dealership where it had originally been purchased The ride was comfortable and the seats were so comfortable Throughout the time we had it there were the regular maintenance needed It did get to the point of needing the transmission replaced the repair shop never told us it needed to be serviced So when we had the transmission replaced we decided to trade it before it started needed more work Even though we have a van now it was easier to carry groceries or anything in the back of the Explorer I hope to buy another Explorer or perhaps an Expedition after the van is paid off
Pos,The exterior Front marker lights are large So far the car is holding up very well My body handles are easy to operate but are black and ugly The Taurus has very light steering Power steering assist is a bit extreme The Taurus doesnt like taking corners at much above the posted speed limit It has been no problems with only oil changes every 5000 k m Not much feedback through wheel Going over speed bumps is no problem The curved rear window seems like it would cost a lot to replace The interior plastics in the 2002 Ford Windstar have a softer more luxurious feeling to them The price paid includes conditioning costs New Brake Pads New Tires Good Year Regettas New Oil Pan New Fuel Oil Air Filters When you lift any of the four handles the interior lights turn on The interior The Taurus seems more stable in winter driving conditions then the Camry Brakes take a bit long to stop on black ice The ashtray my coin holder is illuminated All switches on the door and dash are illuminated except for the controls on the steering wheel Thorough vacuuming shampooing and vinyl conditioning Things done prior to purchase by previous owner New Struts 7 months New Exhaust 1 yr old New Hose Belts Wheel mounted cruise control is easier to operate then the stick type found on the camry Dashboard clock is a nice touch Overall I am satisfied with my Taurus There is a handy built in pen holder All controls are easy to reach Radio has many small buttons but that can be said about any DIN sized radio Handy storage compartment below radio The car has clean lines but lacks styling and personality Rear taillamps are only adequate in size Turn signals arent as noticable as our Windstar Camry since they are not not_amber not_Lower not_body not_cladding not_Car not_seems not_lighter not_then not_the not_new not_Taurus not_Windows not_are not_large When taking corners in the wagon you have to be careful due to the long rear overhang Traction in the winter is adequate I just worry about people slamming into me who dont not_have not_ABS not_has not_happened not_twice I am overall very pleased with my Taurus I am a student and my budget was tight Accords of similar vintage cost roughly double and up of what I paid for this Taurus Car was purchased with just under 140 000 on the odometer Car currently has just over 162 000 The low dash gives good visibility all around reminiscent of a Honda Interior has that old version of modern feel to it The front seats seem to be the same shape as the old Camry Interior of my wagon only holds 5 people Not much lumbar support Seats are covered in a soft material The material in the Windstar is much plusher Overall I like the seat comfort more then our 2000 Camry The Taurus has more windnoise inside then the Camry although part has to due with the age of the car Cars have come a long way in comfort Interior plastics seem a bit too shiny All maintenance done records included with car All recalls taken care of Air conditioning switched to R 134a and refilled New battery Problems with car Surface rust on drivers door fixed with friend The Little Things I Like Self supporting hood with light Courtesy lights on front doors Drivers side dual sunvisors allows you to put one to side and one to front Blue tinted factory reduced glare mirrors Secondary controls for radio Separate clock Bi level dash Vents include a positive off position Roof racks Console Powerful Air Conditioning More powerful then our Toyota Powerful Heater Interior gas and tailgate release Hatch can be opened with just window or whole tailgate Large controls for power windows and power door lock Power window drivers lock out Dual air bags ABS Standard The 3 8L moves the wagon better then our 3 0L Camry under a load Starts in 25 C and 40C weather first try every try Large alternator and battery Ride soaks up bumps barely feel speed bumps Storage compartment in rear floor Blue gauges The Things I Dont Like Weak Speakers AM FM Cass not not_CD not_Foot actuated parking brake Seats dirty spills from previous owner One cupholder Small Steel 14 wheels Headlights arent as strong our Windstars Rear turn signals are red No fender mounted turn signals Common in N A Rear wiper doesnt have intermittent setting Front passenger window lazy Stories heard about the 3 8L engine Space saver spare No Tachometer The Ride Quality The Taurus is not not_as not_sporty as our Camry The Taurus sounds busy when accelerating However once up to speed the Taurus is fine Dash shakes at about 180 km h
Pos,The trunk is huge And talk about trunk space The comfort level in the car is great You could probably fit a small calf in it I highly reccomend this car After wreaking the other car we decided on a mid sized car Well we have had it for about 3 weeks and are really enjoying it It seats 6 comfortably 3 in the front and 3 in the back it has auto windows with a window lock power door locks lots of foot space in the front and back and power steering I am really enjoying the power steering it turns corners so easy and smoothly
Pos,It drives smoothly and only had to make 1 repair since I purchased it And that was something small a hose I bought my 1993 ford Taurus a few months ago and im totally pleased I purchased it mainly because for an older used car it had very low mileage and was kept in great condition with 1 owner I have to say the size of the car took a little while to get used to since I had only had compact size before The mileage is fairly good for a bigger car Any used car should be looked at as that a used car Dont expect to have no problems especially with a 7 year old car However in my case I am extremely pleased with my purchase I would suggest this car for people who have a medium sized family and dont not_want not_something not_too not_large
Pos,This is handy on long trips This truck is still going strong No problems and made it through the winter without a hitch The ride is decent but a little noisy not not_too not_serious not_though not_Handling not_is not_decent There is one minor problem that im living with The dome light stays on intermittently When I park and lock the door the light stays on so I pulled the bulbs out of the sockets so I dont not_drain not_my not_battery The 4 cyl has enough power to do the job but sometimes I wish I had some extra power to pass slower cars and for steep hills It has 105 000 miles on it but im not not_finished not_with not_it not_yet not_I not_plan not_to not_keep not_it not_for not_another not_year not_at not_least not_130 not_000 not_mile not_update I was looking for my first truck in 1997 and after looking at all the makes I settled on the Ford Ranger I chose the Ranger because of the Consumer Reports Rec and the price Went to a dealer in Feb 1997 that had leftover 1996 models First I test drove the regular cab but I just didnt not_fit not_as not_im not_6 not_2 and my knees were jammed into the steering wheel Then I tried the extended cab model and found it roomy I bought the Ranger Extended Cab XLT 2WD 5 speed manual with AC cruise power windows remote entry I have loved this truck since im still driving this truck today with 105 000 miles on it Last week I just got a tune up for the first time for 240 I only had this truck repaired twice once for a noisy wheel bearing for 90 and another time to weld a loose tail pipe for 40 Thats it I find this truck very comfortable with the 60 40 split bench seat and the spacious cab Another feature I like is the 19 9 gallon fuel tank I average 22 mpg for mixed city highway driving so I can get at least 400 miles between fuelings
Pos,I know my limitations The Taurus is not not_a not_gas not_guzzler not_by not_any not_means The trunk is more than adequate for your needs My gas mileage has ranged from 31 mph to 25 mph All this allows you a pleasant driving experience relating to a safer drive The bucket seats are comfortable and the console is easy to use All three of my Tauruses Tauri have been reliable roomy maintenance free fairly stylish and economical The interior is very roomy for driving plenty of head and leg room The power to reach top speed is there when necessary freeway ramps etc The lease cost has always been competitive with prices compared to other similar competing models and dealers As for the wallet factor as I mentioned little or no major repairs just routine maintenance This includes smart air bags and deployment side crash bars and especially important child safety seat anchors The manual says take it in at 25 000 for this this and this I take it in Plus they keep an on line historical record of what maintenance has been done Ford has implemented a Personal Safety Package for the 2000 Taurus But why mess with a good thing I have a winner so stay with it Theres a reason why the Taurus has been one of the top three selling models in America This system works for me I might save a dollar or two by going to a quick lube place for an oil change but the peace of mind is worth going to the experts If you ever lost a wrestling match with the back seat seat belt trying to connect your kiddie seat this offers ease of installation and added safety against shifting Front Wheel Drive is a must in the midwest as even in May a snow storm can hit and make driving dangerous FWD as technical as I can get gives me the additional traction necessary for safer driving My knowledge about automobiles is practical and every day rather than research and engineering I hate popping up the hood looking at the engine and I cant not_tell not_a not_cam not_from not_a not_ham not_However im sure I ll be just as happy with my 2000 Ford Taurus as I was with my first two If you re looking for a mechanical high tech motor minded review of the Taurus stop right here However if you re interested on why I love my Ford Taurus please read on I have always been happy with my Taurus for three reasons Service and reliability safety and My Wallet I always have had a 60 000 mile lease on the Taurus With my first two my only major expense in over 120 000 combined miles was a small engine part less than 100 I do follow the service manual for maintenance relying on my friendly Ford dealer in Franklin Wisconsin for repairs and support with reasonable competitive rates
Pos,I bought a 1988 Ford Taurus in 1996 We have been very pleased with the Fords It was also a one owner four door sedan with low miles We love that Ford so much that we went out and bought another one in 1999 Not just any Ford Taurus my friends but another 1988 Ford Taurus They run and run and run and run I can depend on my Ford I know that when I get up in the morning it will start and when I drive home it will get me there We make sure the cars get a regular 3000 mile oil change and a six month check up with the old Auto Doc Maintenance costs have been low and repairs not not_much to speak of really I figure that I will be looking for another car in about 2 years and I can tell you with confidence that it will be a Ford Taurus It was a one owner four door sedan Now I got to tell you I do some serious driving I drive back and forth to work 50 miles one way This is a Monday through Friday driving experience and sometimes in not not_so not_nice weather because I live in Minnesota After racking up the miles on our Ford Taurus my husband took it over because he only drives 1 mile to work each day
Pos,The trunk is huge and the rear seats fold down The ride is smooth as silk and shifts are hardly noticeable Have not not_used not_the not_heater not_yet not_Front not_and not_rear not_defoggers not_work not_very not_well The steering is also very responsive and again it handles well for a heavy car As for the interior the design is very conservative compared to its competitors Very basic but functional controls The one thing I could not not_figure not_out is why it does not not_have not_4 not_wheel not_disc not_brakes Well I have had my 2000 Taurus for about 4 000 miles now and would recommend it to anyone The climate control is great and I have actually received several favorable comments on how fast the A C kicks in even on 90 degree days You could do much better at your local car stereo shop for the same price Its not not_horrible but for the money there is better out there The engine is smooth and quiet it shifts great and handles good for such a heavy car I believe its the heaviest car in its class The six disc changer is nice even though its located in the trunk Ford should take a lesson from Chrysler with the four disc in dash CD much more convenient If you can live with the plain interior this car should be at the top of your list I believe the 2000 model is back as the number one seller in its category this year but im not not_positive The rears are drums Come on Ford get with the program I have been averaging about 22 25 mpg on a 50 50 mix of highway city driving Leather interior is nice seats could use a little more side support The product was very good though The Impala was also good but very pricey in comparison and I was concerned with the new model design ot being proven Back to the Taurus I purchased the SEL model which has almost everything except a moonroof Its not not_as not_fancy as the Intrepid or Camry or any other of its competitors I also have the Mach stereo system as the car on the lot I chose had it already installed I would not not_recommend not_this not_system not_I not_believe not_it not_was not_a not_675 not_option It has great passing power in the 50 70 mph range ABS works great as I found out right after I purchased it The traction control is also great on slick roads no snow test yet However both of these features are pretty noisy when the kick in which is not not_unusual The new design is much more eye appealing and the 200 hp Duratec V6 adds plenty of punch for a mid sized sedan I looked at the Intrepid Impala and the Taurus The Intrepid was also great but I opted to steer clear of Chrysler after being poorly treated by several Chrysler dealers in my area The Taurus has a lot of great saftey features to go with its 5 star crash test rating a big factor as I begin to start a family Front and side airbags ABS fuel pump shut off to prevent fire glow in the dark drunk release in case a child gets locked in the trunk I also have the keypad entry which is a cool feature although I have yet to use it The heated mirrors will also prove to be useful when old man winter comes a knockin Automatic headlights are great although they do not not_go not_on not_automatically not_when not_you not_put not_on not_the not_windshield not_wipers not_many not_states not_require not_you not_have not_your not_lights not_on not_when not_you not_use not_your not_wipers
Pos,You see im very short The car rides much smoother than my Explorer ever did and its much more fuel efficient Although im still closer to the ground than Id like this model is much better than my mothers 1996 Taurus Well not not_a not_whole not_lot to be honest ive always driven trucks or SUVs and I was very reluctant about buying a car This may sound unrelated but im just over 5 feet tall and I never really liked the idea of being so close to the ground while I drove So if there is anyone out there whos been hit as hard by the gas price hike and is nervous about buying a car Id highly recommend this beautiful economical car Whenever I was forced to drive a car when my car was in the shop or being used by someone else I always felt like I was driving a go cart So when I recently decided to trade in my Explorer for something more fuel efficient I figured Id stay with Ford and go for a Taurus I purchased the Taurus LES the luxury model complete with leather interior and climate control And I have to tell you its been absolutely incredible Apparently Ford has been working on the new design for the Taurus for somewhere in the neighborhood of 5 years
Pos,The seats have lumbar support for those long travels The cold seats in the morning arent the best We were looking to trade in our 2 door Chevy Cavalier Only thing I wish it had was heated leather seats When we bought our 1995 Ford Taurus we were in the market for a four door car We had just had our first baby and the 2 doors werent helping getting the baby in and out of the car along with the other baby items It has lots of trunk space as well great if you have lots of things to take with you anywhere But I still love this car Its not not_a not_gas not_guzzler not_and not_its not_not not_a not_huge not_vehicle not_I not_would not_recommend not_any not_person not_with not_kids not_to not_buy not_this not_car When we saw the Taurus we loved it It had leather seats very roomy and power everything But we have encountered problems with it I dont not_know not_if not_it not_because not_the not_previous not_owner not_didnt not_take not_care not_of not_it or what We have had to fix the transmission twice and replace the fuel pump once Overall its costs us over five thousand dollars
Pos,If you are a family of 5 or more and looking for a nice roomy vehicle the Ford Taurus is the perfect family vehicle but if there are more than of you it starts getting crowded My sister and I had been out and about when we first saw the 89 FOrd Taurus Wagon sitting there on the lot saying buy me buy ME but I passed it off as probably too expensive Well with out my knowing about it my sister went to the lot and asked about the car for me If you had told me when I was 21 that I would be driving a station wagon within 5 years I would probably have laughed myself into a stuper Well I was 23 when I decided that my kids and I had outgrown my little Calais and we needed something with more room so I started looking for the perfect vehicle and I found it very quickly It was a 1989 Ford Taurus Wagon with 100 some odd thousand miles on it air conditioner AM FM radio tape electric seats locks and windows rear defrost and a few more nice little odds and ends and the price was ONLY 2500 Well I called my loan man and he said offer 2100 they took it and I was the proud owner of a very roomy and trustworthy vehicle I had that vehicle for over a year when I decided to buy a new used vehicle but the only reason I decided to get a new one was because my family was growing I now had myself my 3 kids my fiance and his daughter amp now one on the way so we talked it over and decided to get a Mini Van I still miss my wagon but I realize that for a family of 5 it is perfect but when you have a family of 7 that you need a bigger vehicle
Pos,However now the roar is more muted The interior is now much more mainstream My model came equipped with a standard power drivers side seat The Vulcan V6 still roars when under heavy acceleration The freshly restyled exterior and interior are also subjectively improvements over the old model My car is equipped with the full floor console with a floor mounted gear shift In this configuration Ford has designed a unique and very versatile cup holder The quality of the interior materials is substantially better than in the past All in all this is a very nice vehicle at a really great price point It can be adjusted to handle a beverage container of almost any size The seat also has an adjustable lumbar support which is handy on longer trips In the past we have had repeated problems with warped rotors and premature brake pad wear The only aspect of the old Taurus seats that I liked better were their side bolsters The visibility through the rear window is much better due to Ford deep sixing the oval rear window There is no longer an abundance of cheap plastic on the door panels center console and other areas For 2000 the seats do not not_have not_nearly not_the not_lateral not_support not_that not_they not_did not_in not_99 The ride is still far from that of a touring car but not not_at not_all not_unpleasant The reduced blind spots are welcomed when trying to merge onto the freeways in Southern California While still not not_up not_to not_the not_Accord not_or not_Camry not_standard it is still much improved from 98 and 99 This is particularly nice for those of us who spend hours stuck in traffic The squaring off of the rear deck provided these improvements Forward visibility is much better thanks to the redesigned headlights This is a nice feature on a car in this price range as it offers me an infinite number of seating positions This is especially nice on those days when the sun cannot not_decide not_which not_window not_it not_wants not_to not_attack They add an upscale look to a fleet vehicle Access to the trunk is also significantly better as is the usable trunk space This problem area was most noticeable on the 98 and 99 models My 2000 Taurus has 6000 miles on it and has shown no signs of any brake deficiencies In fact I like it so much that I may end up buying a Taurus or Sable Wagon next year when I retire my old Volvo 740 Wagon When compared to my 98 Mazda Millenia the Taurus falls short However I feel it is not not_that not_far not_off not_from not_99 not_Honda not_Accords not_and not_Mazda not_626s not_ive not_driven The oval dashboard has given way to a more traditional one which is slightly more ergonomic in design Radio controls are grouped more logically and the auxilliary 12v power receptacle is now more accessible The visors also have nicely illuminated mirrors which were lacking from my last car I have been particularly impressed with the lower level of noise inside this years model It is certainly better than anything Ford has produced in the past in this class of vehicle I like the fact that Ford includes alloy wheels as standard equipment on the SES model This is a small quibble considering the other improvements Interior details have also been attended to in the 2000 redesign Effective map lights are well placed and easy to use Split sun visors allow the driver and passenger to simultaneously cover the front and side windows The overall ride for 2000 is also enhanced from past years A switch to 16 tires and rims has certainly helped Also I have been told that Ford made a number of small suspension improvements to improve ride quality and responsiveness I certainly have noticed the difference When the local Ford Dealer told me that the problem had been corrected for 2000 I was skeptical Now I am a believer Additional improvements abound My vehicle is the 4 Dr SES model with the OHV Vulcan V6 For 2000 the Vulcans horsepower has been increased slightly and its NVH reduced I have found these improvements to be noticeable if not not_significant I have been driving my 2000 Taurus for four months and have yet to have a single problem with the vehicle I must admit that I did not not_buy not_or not_lease not_the not_car not_My not_employer not_supplies not_me not_with not_a not_vehicle not_due not_to not_my not_line not_of not_work not_Our not_company not_has not_been not_leasing not_the not_Taurus not_since not_1997 and this is the best model year yet In the past we have had numerous problems with the front brakes and rotors
Pos,It has significant power It sounds like a great home stereo system In addition the front air bags have extra sensors My airbag light came on 2 times in the first week It accelerates well from a standstill and at high speeds Unfortunately the design of the doors should have been changed too My last car had Fords premium sound and I was not not_impressed not_The not_Mach not_system not_is not_much not_better The controls are all easy to reach and easy to understand ENGINE I have a 24 valve engine The second problem is that one of the back windows makes a clunk sound when it closes The interior is great Both the front and back seats have a lot of leg room and elbow room One nice feature that my car has is a 6 disc changer with the cartridge inside the passenger compartment The automatic temperature control is a very nice feature I can set a temperature and the car stays there It is very prone to door dings since the top half curves out past the rubber bumper on the door INTERIOR The dealer attempted once to fix it but he was unsuccessful I will take it in again later The dealership is not not_able not_to not_tell not_what not_may not_be not_wrong not_unless not_the not_light not_is not_on not_when not_I not_bring not_it not_in I just bought a new 2000 Ford Taurus 3 weeks ago and ive put on 2000 miles so far Overall I am very happy with it BODY DESIGN This is not not_a not_feature not_that not_I not_particularly not_wanted not_since not_im not_pretty not_tall not_However not_it not_came not_with not_the not_car not_I not_bought This is available on the SE Comfort model if you get the floor shifter and center console I also like that I have both a CD player and tape player OTHER FEATURES Automatic Temperature Control The air bags will deploy at 3 different speed depending on the speed of the crash the position of the seats and whether the passengers have their seat belts on The driving experience is wonderful in this car It is designed so most of the air blows toward the floor for maximum comfort I really enjoy just setting the temperature to 68 or 70 and not not_messing not_with not_the not_controls not_after not_that not_Adjustable not_Pedals It is quiet roomy comfortable and had a great sound system I actually look forward to my commute for the first time in my life I also love the new design I have had 2 minor problems The engine is very quiet in the passenger compartment I also test drove a Volvo S40 and the engine was very loud SOUND SYSTEM I have the Mach audio system which is Fords top of the line The 2000 Taurus has a much cooler design than the bug eyed ovals of the last few year ive had many comments on how cool it looks which is unusual for a family car I read that they changed every body panel except the doors It seems like it would be a neat feature for someone who was shorter but wanted to sit further away from the steering wheel With the touch of a button you can adjust the pedals as much as 3 inches Air Bags I have side air bags which is a nice saftey feature
Pos,My experience is that the drivers seat was very comfortable although the seat backs could use more side bolstering This car was definitely not not_a not_sporty not_handler but the ride was stable at speeds into the 90s and was very comfortable under most conditions My car came equpped with leather seats side airbags and adjustable foot pedals which made it easy for the driver to find a comfortable position My 36 month lease is set to run out on my 2000 Ford Taurus wagon I have really enjoyed the large cargo area provided with the rear seats folded down The stopping distances recorded by independent testers were longer than average for this mid level bracket Another complaint is that while this is not not_a not_noisy not_car not_neither not_is not_it not_as not_quiet not_as not_others not_in not_its not_class Since I take some extremely long road trips noise is something I really notice If Ford could reduce the engine noise road and tire noise and wind noise each a little bit it would greatly improve the driving experience I felt that Taurus wagon had good materials and features for the price
Pos,So why didnt I buy it The gas mileage was a little low 18 19 street This car has a very handsome outside styling to it and beautiful colors to choose from The inside just felt so solid sturdy plush and of course saftey saftety saftey which is Fords whole selling premise with the 2000 Taurus Smart The big full center armrest adds a touch of luxury that seems to be missing from other cars in this class And gas prices are not not_going not_to not_stay not_high not_for not_ever not_Me not_and not_my not_poverty not_thinking not_I not_realize not_now not_that not_I not_should not_have not_just not_went not_with not_what not_I not_really not_wanted And in the end I just became obsessed with saving money and getting an economy car not not_realizing not_that not_theres not_no not_value not_in not_saving not_money not_if not_you not_are not_dissatisfied not_in not_the not_long not_run Theres more to buying a car than simply trying to save money on gas My advice is to buy more car than you think you will need You ll be happier in the long run I ll have a difficult time deciding between a Camry and a Taurus the next time I go looking for a car which could be sooner rather than later im a Toyota person but I came very close to buying the 2000 Taurus I know that some people who have posted here have talked about reliability problems with Ford But I think that was with their older models Their power drivers seat was one of the most comfortable especially with the adjustable pedals 2000 I have ever sat in and I cant not_begin not_to not_tell not_you not_the not_discomfort not_of not_my not_Corolla not_drivers not_seat not_Also not_in not_my not_never not_ending not_new not_car not_search not_the not_Taurus not_was not_the not_most not_quiet not_at not_freeway not_speeds
Pos,The Taurus has got the RIDE covered I do not not_actually not_own not_this not_2001 not_Ford not_Taurus No noise from the outside when in the car with the windows up It is a brand new car so I DO NOT expect anything like that to be happening We took it to the shop and told them of the poor pick up and they said its running fine Throttle response is very poor My parents own it I own a 1991 Camaro and am used to a pretty uncomfortable ride I am also used to extreme acceleration It does not not_have not_the not_ENGINE not_covered not_Every not_time not_you not_start not_out not_riding not_in not_the not_Tuarus not_weierd not_engine not_noises not_accur not_A not_sort not_of not_rattling not_and not_clanking not_if not_you not_will But it is very very roomy with plenty of head room and leg room especially in the back seat Very large trunk space to put my bodies I mean It also has a really hard time starting up and idiling at start up if it is cooled out The Main and worst problem about this car is the pick up speed very very pooor You can push the pedel up and down when travling above 50 or so and nothing will happen until you take it all the way to the floor Keep in mind that it is only a LX and is not not_a not_sports not_car but that is saaad Also the radio is not not_very not_loud not_either
Pos,The car rides very nice and has a large trunk perfect for taking on vacation This car may not not_be not_for not_the not_single not_person but it surly makes a good family vehicle There was a couple of winters I stored it but the vehicle has been ran all year round for about the last 5 years I really like how solid the vehicle is The reason I know is I was hit from behind with a lot of force and it put just a little scratch on the bumper I purchased my 1988 Ford Taurus in 1989 and at this time I have 87 000 miles on it It has a 3 0 liter engine and when taking it on vacation I got 34 miles to the gallon I have replaced tire rods on it but by keeping the oil changed and keeping good coats of wax on it I hope to get more time out of the vehicle
Pos,While definitely not not_the not_most not_glamorous not_car not_to not_drive not_the not_Taurus not_wagon is an efficient soccer mom car After owning the old Taurus wagon model for a few years and having some problems I decided to trade it in for the 99 model and im very glad I did Driving this car is a very pleasant experience I have had no trouble with brakes acceleration or unlike with the old model the air conditioner heat The drivers seat adjusts in many ways so that I can be comfortable when I drive and stay alert Even though there have been minor incidents in which this car has gotten roughed up the only injury was done to the exterior appearance of the car Even though ive only owned this car for about a year I am still happy with the fact that I have not not_had not_reason not_to not_bring not_it not_in not_for not_any not_repairs not_After not_owning not_the not_previous not_Taurus not_wagon not_model and a Volvo wagon im glad to say that this is the best station wagon that ive come across
Pos,And any electrical problem is automatically blamed on the conversion people However I have to say that dealing with the conversion people is like pulling teeth I have owned my Ford Econoline full size van with Regency custom conversion for just over a year now I love the van It is such a comfortable ride compared to the other large vehicles on the market like an Expedition or Suburban because it isnt not_built not_on not_a not_truck not_frame Because all of the interior parts are considered part of the conversion I have to wait for EVERY part to be ordered even the seatbelts which had dried glue on them The ground wire to the drivers side lighted vanity mirror was loose so the light only worked intermittently and it took several tries for them to finally get it right because they just kept trying to replace the part not not_find not_the not_root not_of not_the not_problem not_I not_realize not_that not_parts not_of not_this not_problem not_lies not_with not_the not_dealership not_but not_they not_are not_the not_only not_Regency not_approved not_dealer not_in not_my not_area not_so not_I not_am not_forced not_to not_use not_them not_instead not_of not_an not_alternate not_Ford not_Dealer
Pos,Wow what a truck The powerful fans in these systems are ideal for any climate The best and most used setting by me is the Automatic Four Wheel Drive It has the rear bench seat towing package dual zone climate control and the premium sound system No problem I think the Expedition probably has the best brakes in its class The steering is variable power assit which makes driving a car of this size a lot easier In this setting the car is supposed to enage the 4wd system when it feels tires spinning un evenly While the four wheel drive differential lacks a neutral setting I highly doubt this will discourage most buyers from purchasing this car Of course if you are towing anything you want to make sure you can stop with all that extra weight They can heat the car faster then an explorer can partly because of a very strong and powerful floor blower in the back Likewise they can cool the car very quickly and keep it cooled Or should I say Car With the way the Expedition drives and handles it does not not_feel not_like not_the not_5 not_800 not_lbs not_truck not_it not_really not_is not_I not_have not_the not_first not_model not_year not_1997 not_with not_the not_5 not_4L not_engine not_and not_4wd You cant not_stop not_instantaneously but for a car of its size you will be very surprised at how tight and responsive the brakes are If you are going to use this car as a people mover also I would very strongly recommend that you buy the dual zone climate control It is a great added comfort for wet or icy roads and can be used up to 60 mph the system will automatically detect if you are going over 60 and wont engage so as not not_to not_damage not_the not_transmission not_All not_in not_all not_Ford not_really not_came not_through not_with not_an not_amazing not_successor not_to not_the not_Explorer Also the larger engine helps with accelerating from a stop but because of the immense weight of the car you can forget about those quick 60 80mph passing acceleration and dont not_even not_try not_to not_pass not_anything not_going not_up not_a not_hill not_at not_a not_fast not_speed not_Dont not_get not_me not_wrong not_this not_car not_doesnt not_lack not_any not_oomph not_especially not_when not_it not_comes not_to not_towing not_You not_dont not_even not_feel not_the not_weight not_of not_a not_3 not_000 not_lbs not_boat not_behind not_you not_And not_with not_a not_8 not_000 not_lbs not_towing not_limit not_you not_can not_certainly not_tow not_large not_loads
Pos,Hope you have as good a luck with yours My Expy came with a trailer towing package full power inside and inclement weather package You will find that while towing anything slight upgrades in the road will cause your Expy with the little motor to kick out of overdrive and into high gear The motor a 4 8 liter is very weak on power when towing If your thinking of buying an Expy and plan on towing anything I strongly urge you to consider the bigger motor Ms series tire for your expy if you change tires I enjoy my Expy and found it to be a comfortable ride easy to manuever stable at high speeds and during changing lanes and a real joy to drive If you live in a mountainous area then be prepared NOT to use overdrive Overall my Expy is a comfortable ride and we have had little problems with it The longevity of all Ford motors is proven but do consider an extended warranty as this vehicle has numerous sensors that can nickle and dime you I did have a bad ride and alot of road noise with the Goodyear tires that came on the expy from the factory I switched to Michelins and found the ride much better and the road noise gone Consider the Michelin LTX
Pos,First my radio is a grade A CD This feature is also found in the heating system Tape player with a six disc changer for the CD player The seats are remarkably comfortable and the car is extremely roomy The car is great and it is one of the most comfortable rides ive ever had Also because the seat is raised you dont not_have not_a not_place not_to not_put not_you not_legs Once you ve mastered driving you get the uneasy task of learning to park the beast The only part of the car that there is little to no headroom is the third seat in the way back The third seat is slightly raised and because of that you lose a little bit of headroom and if you are a taller person you lose all of your headroom This car is amazing I know many people who look at it see only a massive road hogging beast however the Ford Expedition is one of the most stylish sleek sporty SUVs in my opinion The main console is in the dash board however in the back seat there is a separate console with a head phone jack for the people in the back to set their own stations according to their musical tastes It is hard to find spaces to fit the car into but dont not_stress not_it not_too not_much not_because not_although not_rare not_they not_are not_there not_With not_a not_mastery not_of not_driving not_and not_parking not_the not_car not_is not_perfect The speaker system is very good and although many people will add a specialized stereo system to their cars the factory works fine for me Not only is the radio a great quality but it has two sets of controls For my unfortunate friends in the way back I apologize next time you ll remember to call shotgun wont you A few of the features that make the car even more comfortable are the heating and radio features Both the front and the backseat have climate controls to set the temperature for both portions of the car If you are looking for a massive car that handles amazingly well Id recommend that you at least test drive a Ford Expedition When I was first on the market for an SUV I was really looking for the Ford Explorer A friend of mine has one and I absolutely loved driving it It was a great truck however I couldnt find any decent inexpensive Explorers and I settled for a Jeep Grand Cherokee However dont not_get not_me not_wrong not_my not_Expedition not_definitely has that rugged edge Driving an Expedition is something that everyone has got to get used to Even if you have driven an SUV before the Expedition is rather large it takes some time to get used to Judging the distance from cars on your side and front is the most frustrating at times but after a few drives everything falls nicely into place My first tip Stay away from parking garages until you are confident in your parking techniques Parking in a parking garage is generally awkward however when you ad the size of the Expedition it gets even harder Not to mention the fact that and it never fails the first time you drive into the garage you will worry that your car wont fit If you live in a city be forewarned parallel parking is rough This was a huge mistake After having the Jeep for about three months I was in an accident I was coming home from work when someone slammed into my passenger side the car buckled and was ripped apart Not only was I extremely shaken up but I was also on the prowl for a new car Thankfully my insurance company is very understanding and was extremely quick with my claim I again set out looking for an Explorer however when I got to the dealership I found that love at first sight does exist When I saw the Maroon Ford Expedition I was in love
Pos,Dears U V shoppers This vehicle is a big thing on comfort Now there was no more reloading discs every time you wanted some new tunes If they got could there was no more yelling at the driver to Turn the heat up I think we all know how annoying that gets It used to be that if you sat in the back seat you were very uncomfortable but in this vehicle the back seats are just as comfortable as the front When we first got our shiny new Expedition everyone wanted to ride in it One of the options we decided on was a six C D changer Your reading my review on this vehicle in hopes I can tell you all about the Ford Expedition Well your in a lot of luck because I have recently purchased one This means no more taking two vehicles and wasting money on gas As for you who cant not_seem not_to not_stay not_away not_from not_the not_lake not_you not_can not_pull not_that not_nice not_boat not_behind not_you not_oh not_yeah not_and not_dont not_forget not_all not_of not_your not_fishing not_buddies Not only that but as well as holding 8 passengers when the THIRD row is set up this vehicle can tow a trailer behind it For all you who show horses and have a big family you no longer have to rely on a pick up to get the job done That means comfort for the drivers ears and no more headaches either Well to sum it all up which is pretty hard to do With everything this specials U V comes with theres too much to say Now theres only one problem who gets to drive This came in as a nice option for the people in the back for they could listen to the radio on headphones in the back when grandma up front wanted to listen to Jazz no offense to jazz I love it but some people dont not_Another not_thumbs not_up not_for not_the not_rear not_seat not_passengers not_are not_the not_separate not_heating not_and not_air not_conditioning not_controls not_for not_them
Pos,We looked at all the comparable SUVs but we felt the Expedition always came out ahead We have been looking at the Expedition since it first came out We finally purchased one this past month It was big but not not_too not_big We had the features of the larger SUV suburban excursion without the bulk and still the sporty look of the smaller SUV Driving this vehicle makes me feel safe with the kids THATs IMPORTANT It drives smooth sturdy and strong I dont not_feel as if I am going to be blown over by the wind If you are a busy mom that needs a reliable vehicle with lots of room yet doesnt look like a bus this car is perfect for you unless of course you dont not_like not_driving not_big not_vehicles As a busy mother with two children and always on the go I live in my car it is like my second home I have to be able to keep things in my car just in case when I am away from the home My Expedition is big enough for me to do that without being TOO BULKY and still look good
Pos,I leased this vehicle for two years It was the best vehicle I have ever owned leased The four wheel drive switch on the dash was awesome I loved not not_having not_a not_shifter not_on not_the not_floor The room was so nice for my family of 5 as no one had to be crowded while traveling The vehicle I leased had running boards which made it nice to get in and out of in a dress What I noticed the most was how well it handled I was worried with such a large vehicle that it would be hard to control It had a very smooth ride and the steering was so much better than the Explorer I had before I loved the heating cooling contols in the back of the vehicle It had a console with the CD changer inside I loved being able to have 6 CDs in at a time and the ability to change them easily I am not not_much not_up not_on not_the not_details not_of not_the not_engine not_all not_I not_know not_is not_that not_it not_ran not_great not_and not_never not_gave not_me not_any not_trouble not_in not_the not_two not_years not_I not_leased not_I not_am not_seriously not_thinking not_of not_leasing not_another not_one not_when not_the not_lease not_on not_our not_truck not_expires
Pos,The solenoid is readily accessible on the side of the drive motor It is vacuum operated so if the solenoid goes just disconnect the vacuum lines and switch them around The only problem I encountered in two years was a faulty solenoid on the four wheel drive motor Got it stuck in 4wd low For anyone that this happens to its an easy makeshift fix I purchased an Expedition in April 97 quite by accident The Explorer that I had ordered was destroyed in the St Louis floods Anyway about the vehicle A 1 The Expedition was a joy to drive luxurious and car like wonderful on a long trip Four wheel drive made towing a large boat out of the water a breeze even tore some trees out of the ground for a neighbour no problem This will get you to a dealer without being restricted to 20mph Gas mileage is not not_for not_the not_faint not_of not_heart not_or not_those not_relying not_on not_economy not_9 not_miles not_per not_gallon not_in not_the not_city not_13 not_16 not_mpg not_on not_the not_highway not_Shear not_size not_alone not_guarantees not_when not_two not_cars not_are not_going not_for not_the not_same not_parking not_spot not_you not_win not_everytime not_Braking not_was not_excellent not_for not_such not_a not_heavy not_vehicle not_6200 not_lbs not_I not_miss not_my not_Expedition
Pos,We purchased our Expedition after test driving both the Expedition and the Explorer It also has a third seat which is nice when there are more than 5 passenger If you have 2 or more kids and are looking for a sports utility vehicle I definitely recommend the Ford Expedition We are very pleased that we purchased the Expedition which gives us ample room for traveling to haul all the extras It has a very nice ride and is very comfortable to ride in The only draw back is the high cost of fueling the gas tank We are young with a growing family so cabin space was very important to us The Expedition had much more cabin space with the ability to put three car seats across in the middle seat With the Explorer only one car seat would fit comfortably in the middle of the seat
Pos,That was kinda cool The sound of it demands attention Things I dont not_like not_ground not_clearance This truck also makes you feel really safe The truck I drove had the Off Road package One thing I havent mentioned yet was rear seat comfort The one I drove had the Lariat package which included all the bells and whistles This shockingly is more leg room than even the front passengers have At 6 0 I was more than pleased This truck is a giant sure but when it comes to comfort power and styling you just cant not_beat not_this not_truck Of course this Harley has a cab for 5 I got the bucket seats air conditioning CD changer trip computer and reliability So if you re in the market for a work truck a crew cab or even a half price Hummer this truck is for you All right now that im married and we have a great dane I have grown out of my regular cab Chevy Well you wont be disappointed here either I believe its rated at 41 of head room and almost 43 of leg room As for power how does 235 HP 2 700 RPM and 500 lb ft of torque 1 600 RPM sound Yes I had the Powerstroke diesel The one I drove was a 4X4 so I sat higher than just about everything else out there I was almost eye to eye with the big trucks Although this is not not_a not_choice not_for not_many not_people not_this not_truck not_will not_out not_pull not_just not_about not_anything And it looks good doing it Another thing I like about the diesel is that its like riding on a Harley It has served its purpose well and done everything ive asked of it but there is just not not_enough room anymore Now being from Texas im sure im living up to every stereotype when I say I love the Ford F 350 Crew Cab If your familiar with Ford trucks you know that this is the top of the line and they like to charge you for it The leather seats do more than just hug you they embrace you After a hard day at work they just call out to you And this is a truck that actually makes you look forward to the commute Its that comfy This includes two skid plates one for the transfer case and one for the fuel tank and a decal With the size of this truck you think it would be perfect for doing a little trail riding However the pumpkin has only 8 of clearance I know I know thats what lift kits and 35 tires are for Little news for you even 35 tires look a little small on this truck Only other thing I dont not_like not_parallel not_parking Never had to do it just wouldnt not_happen
Pos,The mechanic who put in the new transmission even admitted that he liked the little Ford Escorts and said he had purchased one for his son to drive Dont laugh but I love my Ford Escort I am currently driving my second Escort purchased in 1994 I call her Trixie and she has carried me to and from work daily on vacation and around town for the past six years How many other auto owners can make that claim I love the size of my Escort since it is easy to maneuver Living in Ohio where our winters can deliver deep snow and freezing rain the front wheel drive is a life saver literally So all in all I am terribly disappointed that Ford has decided to stop making the Escort I have no idea what I will purchase next but then I guess I still have over 40 000 miles left to make that decision The new transmission cost 1200 00 parts and labor but it was well worth the money I preferred to invest that money in my little car rather than to put it toward the purchase of a new auto I consider it the same theory as paying for a heart transplant for a loved one He explained that he called them disposable cars because typically owners of Escorts purchase them and drive them until they die along the side of the road tires pointing up like poor little dead insects Most Escort owners drive them until they have 200 000 miles on them The odometer reads 67 973 miles but you need to add a digit to realize that it now has a total of 167 973 miles on it Yup 167 973 miles and still putt putt putting up the road I put well over 100 miles per day on the odometer not not_counting not_side not_trips Yes but it was no fault of the Escort it my own negligence that caused that problem I remember well the day the mechanic asked me when I had last had the transmission fluid changed and I replied Changed I think you can almost imagine the look on his face My first Escort lasted for seven years so this one has already outlasted that one All jokes and smug looks aside anyone who has owned an Escort will tell you that they are a good little automobile Replacing worn out parts is a fact of life so I have never worried when I needed new brakes timing belts or unfortunately a new transmission A NEW TRANSMISSION YOU SAY
Pos,Why you ask The fuel economy is amazing The stereo is not not_great The little speakers that come in the Escort are junk The controls are all located in right places no hunting for missing controls If you like music go out and get some good speakers installed This little car was outfitted with the 1 9L in line 4 mated to a 5 speed manual transmission Over the years this little car served me well and I would not not_hesitate not_in not_getting not_another not_one Doing this will get the gears to line up and reverse is ready to use The Transmission is great with one exception REVERSE Sometimes reverse can be a little tricky to engage No big deal though just put the car in first gear before you try to put it in reverse The best highway mileage I have recorded is 41mpg on a trip from Reno NV to Salt Lake City UT The ride of the little Escort is on par with most cars in this class Handling is good at speeds even up to 90mph This problem was present from the first day I got the car Every mechanic I spoke to said this is normal for these cars The air conditioning works great although there is a noticeable lack of power when the air conditioning is on The seats are comfortable for the day to day driving but for the long trips bring a pillow After 9 years and 196 000 miles its time to retire the Escort 3 door I cant not_say not_enough not_about not_this not_little not_car I bought the car back in 94 for 13 000 After 9 years of commuting logging over 196 000 miles its time for a new car The family does not not_fit not_in not_this not_little not_economy not_car not_anymore not_Its not_still not_running not_great not_and not_ready not_to not_go not_The not_only not_repairs not_to not_this not_car not_over not_the not_years have been 1 wheel bearing 1 timing belt 1 battery and the head light bulbs I cant not_believe not_it not_All not_these not_years and so few repairs The trunk and fold down seats are perhaps the best feature of all I used this car for commuting around the San Jose area as a Computer Networking consultant For one particular job I needed to haul some computers to Oakland I was stunned when I fit 11 computers into the back of this little wonder
Pos,It makes it excellent for students The size of the car makes it quite unsafe The only problem as one reviewer had mentioned was icy condition What else Readers digest rated Ford Escort 94 as a recommended used car 2000 It handles road very good I dont not_feel not_any not_inconveniences not_with not_steering You wont have to worry about someone stealing it It is great to commute Insurance is reasonable He cannot not_be not_more not_happy not_about not_how not_much not_stuff not_he not_can not_load not_in not_his not_car not_Insurance not_I not_pay not_280 not_per not_year not_for not_liability not_only not_living not_in not_Cleveland not_area My wife is short she can see from under it but I have to bend my neck each time I need to look to the right I general the car is very good You can feel being blown from the highway when a large truck passes you Also bumpers are plastic Sometimes its hard to see whats ahead when an SUV is ahead of you The position of the rear view mirror is totally wrong I bought my Escort in 1997 with 48 K on it Now it has 88 K and it is 7 years old Still it hasnt had any serious problems I only had to change worn out brake pads and tires thats it Engine and transmission work like Swiss watch You d need to learn pumping breaks with your foot I did not not_have not_any not_crushes not_on not_icy not_road but I was close once Some people consider automatic belts a nuisance I even like them Never got caught by a trooper with belts unfastened Mounting a Christmas tree on the roof though creates a problem Front seats have enough space for legs but it may be a little cramped in the rear Trunk is surprisingly large for such a small car I have a hatchback but my friend owns a wagon which I think is smarter
Pos,The biggest problem its a station wagon and it looks like it If you can swallow your pride you ll save a lot of money with car It is a small car with a small engine 1 9L so dont not_expect not_to not_outrun not_anyone but it does have enough pickup for a normal driving even in the aggressive Washington DC traffic I grew up worshiping the quality of Japanese German and Swedish cars but I have to admit my last few years driving this very inexpensive Ford have convinced me to consider another one the next time I need a new car While it isnt not_much not_to not_look not_at not_it not_has not_been not_immensely not_practical not_and not_reliable not_I not_inherited not_this not_vehicle not_from not_my not_parents not_and not_as not_a not_poor not_college not_student not_at not_the not_time not_I not_couldnt not_say not_no not_despite not_its not_grocery not_getter not_nature Now that I own a house commute 20 miles to work in heavy traffic and park in cramped lots I appreciate its sizable cargo space good gas mileage and nimble handling I recently recommended it to a friend and I recommend it to anyone out there who is looking for this type of vehicle it is small and agile with an excellent turning radius it gets about 35mpg on mixed driving can haul a lot more than you would think and its very reliable Mine has 119 k miles with only minimal maintenance new belts and an alternator at 100k and oil every 3 5 k
Pos,We bought our car brand new four years ago Our car came with the extra stereo package which is great We have had to replace the power window switch once but other than that nothing major In fact I just went with my little brother to buy his first car The car has great pickup pulling out on a major highway and also does great up mountains It was everything I wanted in a car even the perfect color of green He also got an Escort a 92 model and he also loves his Hope this helps We have taken two other adults on many trips with us and never hear any complaints on the leg room We have an automatic with power windows cd player from the factory and air conditioning This car has been great No major problems It has a great sound to it The car rides very smooth and handles well I would recommend this car to anyone The only thing I would change about the car is something very simple and that is I would have a middle arm rest for the driver Like I said that is something that anyone can live without At first I worried about having a two door when taking others on trips with us If I were to buy another car today I would probably buy a four door because it is a little hard for adults to climb in the back seat of the car As far as leg room it seems to have plenty for four adults
Pos,It looks mean The first thing that sold me on it was the intimidating appearance of the thing I just want to say that ive had my 1992 4x4 XLT fullsize Bronco for 4 years now and I love it I couldnt ask for anything more in a vehicle The interior is very roomy and comfortable and gauges and switches are clear and easy to reach Currently it has 135 000 miles on it with not not_a not_lick of trouble Everything on the Bronco is stock besides the 33 tires and a Dynomax turbo muffler The ride is decent for a truck like SUV but the stiff suspension can really help out when off roading The 5 0L powerplant is surprisingly powerful I can beat my friends stock Chevy Z71 0 60 even with my 33 tires although he hates when I bring it up I dont see why people gripe and complain about the reliability of this vehicle Me and about 8 of my other friends have gone over 120 000 miles on our Broncos 135 000 for me without incident I just think that some people dont not_know not_what not_the not_term not_routine not_maintenance not_means
Pos,The lateral support seemed pretty much nonexistent The 5 speed automatic transmission was also faultless and very smooth The 2 forward opening doors on the extended cab were very welcome The Edge never let you forget it was a tall truck The white Edge edition is a sharp looking vehicle with the performance to back up its aggressive looks For the type of people in the Wranger Xterra demographic however this is a great vehicle The trade off for all the power was woeful gas mileage 15 17 mpg range in all driving conditions The driving impression is quite different from my 1998s 10 which feels so carlike in most driving situations The unremarkable seats tire noise and poor mileage might make it tiresome to live with for some people This was a pleasant surprise but a surprise nonetheless especially considering Id been quoted a rate of 18 00 day Truly a bargain With gas costing 2 00 and more per gallon for regular in many California cities it made for some painful gas stops Id been expecting a 2wd 3 0L V 6 extended cab model Apparently this is the only way Budget equips Rangers rented from SFO The first thing I noticed when getting in was how stiff the seats seemed compared to mys 10 pickup I felt like I was sitting in a truck The interior was handsomely trimmed in typical Ford style Driving the vehicle out of the garage one of the first things I noticed was a lot of tire noise from the knobby Goodyear Wranger RTs tires This may not not_be not_the not_best not_long not_haul not_driver not_I not_thought not_to not_myself not_During not_the not_course not_of not_more not_than not_1000 not_miles not_of not_driving not_in not_various not_conditions not_including not_some not_off not_road not_runs not_around not_Big not_Sur not_I not_found not_the not_truck not_to not_be not_a not_trusty not_friend The 6 disc CD player also decided it wanted to keep my cds just before I returned the vehicle I had to fiddle with it for more than 10 minutes before it decided to eject my cds It corners competently on the highway with the power to pass and accelerate from a stop quickly Driving the winding roads on PCH around Big Sur the truck felt solid and well planted Switching to 4wd was a seamless affair with a simple dash mounted dial The chassis also seemed very tight and squeak free despite the large openings the trucks doors could provide Anyone who has these 4 doors will wonder how extended cabs ever did without them Overall I would say this is a very versatile vehicle with good looks and strong performance I had the opportunity to rent a fully loaded 4wd 4 0L Edge edition Ranger supercab for 10 days recently I was traveling through Northern California and camping in Big Sur with stops in San Francisco and Lake Tahoe Initially I was surprised that the Ranger Id reserved was such a highly optioned model
Pos,My biggest complaint about the drive system is the lack of limited slip It holds onto turns in a gravel road very well Doesnt slide sideways You can get an accessory that will eliminate the problem over 500 00 We consistently choose our F 150 for Long trips over our 2000 F 250 and our 94 300ZX And remember 17 tires can be hard to get and pricey It rides like a Cadillac on the road but handles bumps rocks mud gravel like a racing 4x4 Id like it to last longer even if it isnt not_as not_fast not_About not_the not_4X4 not_Offroad not_option If you get one wheel in a muddy ditch it will spin in the mud and rob torque from the other three It has the most sophisticated suspension of any truck I know Dont let that scare you its been VERY durable It does not not_have not_as not_much not_power not_or not_gas not_mileage not_as not_the not_Chevy not_but not_generally not_Ford not_does not_seem not_to not_forego not_power not_for not_reliability not_and not_frankly You get 17 inch wheels with recalled lug nuts your wheels can fall off with the old ones two 4X4 OFFROAD stickers A guard plate under the engine Offroad does have a higher book value and does sit up higher but ask yourself if its worth the price The interior is very comfortable Fully adjustable seats and steering wheel Although the gauges are out of view with the steering wheel lowered all the way The three door system and small rear seats are great for kids but I wouldnt not_subject not_an not_adult not_to not_a not_very not_long not_drive not_back not_there not_Colder not_air not_it not_was not_110 not_this not_summer not_than not_the not_2000 not_F not_250 What does my Ford F 150 4x4 Offroad Have in common with Submarines Airplanes and 18 wheelers ive flown my f 150 airborne many times ive driven in water over the hood I have the pictures ive towed overloaded Trailers ive chased coyotes through rough terrain ive loaded the truck with over twice the weight rating I even put in a supercharger and pushed the 4 6 liter overhead valve Triton V8 engines power way past its design limits Its been to the shop for oil tires brakes plugs a rear end oil seal and one O2 sensor in 90 000 miles
Pos,We hauled around a dozen kids a soccer team all day from game to game and they said it a smooth ride From the cab when we went over rail road tracks it was very smooth I gotta have it My former boss had one of these precious trucks and she let me drive it Well I am originally a Chevy only type but when i took off in this particular truck i feel in love with it The feature that i like the most are the third door and the bench seat in the front and back are so comfortable Its like a couch
Pos,It was used but the milage on it was very low and the warranty had been extended for us for the term of the financing Big Plus It came with A C ABS both driver and passenger airbags and another plus is that the passenger side airbag can be turned off great if you have to fasten a car seat in the truck Ok right off I love this truck We bought the 97 Ford F 150 XLT shortbed standard cab truck and it was definitly worth buying The price was very reasonable for the great quality we received We have had the truck almost a year now and it has been outstanding No major issues at all Because it is a truck it would not not_be not_good not_for not_families not_because not_of not_the not_lack not_of not_room but this is an excellent work truck Even on long road trips the seats are very comfortable Driving it is a real pleasure very responsive and handles well You want a good truck go with the Ford F 150
Pos,So the next time someone says Pick ups are a mans work vehicle you can say Pick ups are for women and families too The rear seat is also split and can be folded down entirely or independently depending on how much room you need and when folded it is a solid metal bottomed cargo area Three seatbelts in the back ensured the safety of ALL my children and in front are 2 air bags with a shut off for the passenger side air bag in case you have a fourth child It has a V 8 engine with a convenient switch to take you easily from 2 wheel drive to 4 wheel drive it is the most comfortable and easy to drive vehicle I have ever owned and I can haul anything I haul wood hay wood chips gravel rocks the pretty kind I am an avid rock hound lumber you name it you have the room and the power to haul just about anything If you are a person who needs an all around versatile vehicle then the Ford F 150 Extended Cab pick up is what you want I recently purchased one and it is the first full sized pick up I have ever owned I have 3 children and did not not_think not_a not_pick not_up not_would not_be not_a not_practical not_choice not_for not_me not_considering not_the not_fact not_that not_you not_need not_room not_in not_a not_family not_vehicle not_for not_the not_entire not_family not_I not_had not_always not_borrowed not_a not_pick not_up not_from not_my not_families not_shop not_when not_I not_needed not_to not_haul not_a not_load not_of not_wood not_hay not_etc not_Much not_to not_my not_surprise not_this not_pick not_up not_had not_MUCH not_more not_room not_than not_the not_sport not_utility not_vehicle not_I not_had not_previously not_been not_driving not_and not_it not_has not_a not_third not_door not_which not_completely not_erases not_the not_problem not_of not_trying not_to not_load not_kids not_groceries not_saddles not_or not_whatever not_you not_need not_to not_put not_in not_the not_back not_seat
Pos,Our biggest complaint is low fuel mileage Shes only getting about 10 2 mpg We bought our 97 F 150 Extended cab XLT Flareside 4x4 in 1998 We dont not_put not_much not_mileage not_on not_her and she just turned 4000 miles It has the 5 4L V 8 We ve now had it for just over 2 years The seats are comfy the sound system is awesome Its nice to hit a button on the dash to go into 4x4 rather than having to step out to lock in hubs Thats all city driving Its roomy sharp looking runs great probably not not_even not_broke not_in not_yet and has plenty of interior room Back seat folds down so can use that area for cargo without getting the seat dirty That 5 4L V 8 has plenty of power for towing a horse trailer boat or r v We do love the look of the interior but feel that Ford could use a little less plastic for that caliber of vehicle
Pos,The only disconcerting thing is that I have to step up into it im just glad that it has handles to assist I bought this vehicle along with my husband his dream truck and fell in love with it to I couldnt believe that I as a woman older one at that could find this 97 Ford XLT pickup so comfortable and so much fun to drive I find the control and driving real pleasureable and exciting The driving is just as easy as driving my Sable which is a power steering The XLT has 4 wheel drive when you need it and its easy to shift it into 4 wheel drive I would recommend this truck to anyone Its comfortable fun and easy to drive even for a 50 year old bat like myself I wouldnt not_say not_that not_a not_young not_person not_would not_appreciate not_all not_of not_the not_qualities not_of not_the not_XLT not_but not_I not_guess not_thats not_why not_they not_built not_them not_Ford not_tough not_even not_for not_an not_adventerous not_young not_person
Pos,I bought my 1996 Contour used last June This car is not not_a not_sports not_car not_by not_any not_means but it has get up and go as well as comfort There are a few things I would change though one is the cupholder yes only ONE it is pathetic and broken already The seats in the Contour are so comfy I test drove a brand new Escort ZX2 or something like that the newest one and sighed a huge sigh of relief when I got back into my Contour My overall impression of the car is good I bought the 5 speed because I think it is more fun and easier to control especially in the snow Front wheel drive also makes it great for snow driving Another thing I would change is the mechanism to recline the seat I have to roll it backward over and over to recline same to put it upright again A major waste of time I would love my car more if it got better gas mileage I average 25 MPG There have been several Ford instigated recalls for warranty repairs however in my case they were all preventative as I have not not_had not_a not_single not_problem not_in not_the not_past not_8 not_months not_I not_did not_buy not_the not_extended not_warranty not_though not_those not_bells not_and not_whistles not_get not_pricey not_to not_fix not_I not_would not_say not_test not_drive not_one not_you not_might not_like not_it There are so many things I like about it cruise control and tilt steering wheel dual airbags ABS brakes A C and power door locks windows and mirrors I guess what I am saying is that it has all the bells and whistles I like I bought it because I wanted a larger car I had a 2 door Neon that was more comfortable
Pos,Our other car is a 2001 Dodge Caravan The motor continues to run smooth and very reliable The only negative thing to mention is the ride The interior has held up and is in very good condition The car is now 5 years old and has 75 000 miles plus The car has a personality that I love to drive While the car doesnt have a large engine it has plenty of pickup and handled large inclines easily While the price for a new car was out of my reach I found a great value in a barely used 96 model The front wheel drive and stable wheelbase makes it a easy car to drive and get through town to get the daily errands accomplished Update August 2002 The only problem I found is head space I am over 6 foot tall and it can become a little uncomfortable in long drives The car has had a couple of recalls and Ford has fixed them quickly Both recalls were for things that I was not not_experiencing not_brakes not_and not_exhaust The exterior is very good for this amount of use I drive is daily thus there are many dings and scratches from rocks and other debris in the road My previous car was in the shop for repairs and I had to rent a car 1997 Ford Contour was what I rented and I really enjoyed The smoothness of the Caravan makes the Contour seem alot rougher Over a week may go by and I wont drive the van and the Contour seems very smooth But then I drive the van and the I become less pleased I would definitely recommend this car to anyone who is wanting a good car to last a long time
Pos,The car I really dont think was meant for driving on gravel roads These things are minor but they provide numerous headaches if you are not not_expecting not_them not_to not_happen The car is one of the best I have driven but if you live on a gravel road you are in for some surprises Another problem is you have to constantly have to lubricate ALL hinges and locks in order to keep them from locking up and causing damage The other problem i have had is with the courtesy lamp after about 1 year of driving it i had to replace it because the switch fused together and kept blowing fuses The gravel roads tend to put the car to the limit I have occasionally had to do some adjustments to the cars suspension system and had to rewire some of the wiring in order to get the car to perform the way it was intended A few of the places that need to be fixed were the dash lights i had to put in a wire protector in order to keep the wires from wearing from the bumps on the road
Pos,The van was a two tone maroon and tan My only criticism is the cost of repair Our lives were in the early stages of a complete overhaul Well not not_entirely We were driving an old Corolla with nearly 200 000 miles on it and were becoming cramped The interior was customized boasting of quad captains chairs plush carpeting color TV and oak trim throughout There was plenty of room and the engine bolted up and down those steep Pennsylvania hills like a champ They seemed a bit bulky and their style never really changed in all the years of their manufacturing It had fiberglass running boards giving it a sort of solid cruising appeal This Aerostar was clean and elegant The van rolled down the road with ease and the acceleration left nothing to be desired Handling was impressively good considering its size and shape My wife was in the end stages of her first pregnancy and we wanted a minivan Truthfully I hadnt even considered a Ford no pun intended I was focusing primarily on the Mercury Villagers We wanted something with power reliability comfort and a good look Quite frankly the Aerostar was not not_my not_first not_choice not_Aerostars not_have not_a not_tendency not_to not_rust not_I not_certainly not_dont not_want not_to not_drive not_a not_rust not_bucket The extended rear left plenty of room for strollers pack n plays and luggage Passengers found themselves in a comfortable situation without feeling cramped or inhibited I fired up the 4 0 liter V6 engine only to find it quiet and smooth The odometer read only 68 000 miles Needless to say I bought it I have been very pleased with this van Not long after I purchased it we packed it with seven people an over abundance of luggage and drove to Pittsburgh It just wasnt not_the not_van not_I not_was not_looking not_for not_However not_some not_friends not_of not_my not_parents not_were not_selling not_their not_1994 not_Ford not_Aerostar not_Extended not_van not_I not_just not_happened not_to not_be not_visiting not_my not_parents not_in not_Detroit and thought it might be fun to check out an Aerostar I have to say that I was impressed Though it is not not_scheduled not_for not_a not_tune not_up not_until not_about not_100 not_000 not_miles not_it not_will not_cost not_me not_approximately not_400 not_because not_of not_the not_compact not_engine not_compartment not_I not_did not_have not_the not_drive not_belt not_replaced not_recently and it only cost me 36 I suppose like most cars the various repairs will balance out This is a good vehicle and one that deserves consideration I would buy another
Pos,It has a very smooth ride The F 250 is a great work truck its also a great family truck It is easy to work everything in this truck Its roomy in the front and the back It is big so I wouldnt not_recommend not_it not_for not_people not_who not_feel not_insecure not_about not_big not_vehicles It has many options which include Power windows and door locks Quad Cab four doors Bed cover Cd Player Four Wheel Drive This truck can tow a good sized travel trailer or a good sized horse trailer I love the Four wheel Drive I probably have over 1 000 miles of four wheeling in this truck and I have never gotten stuck Its a good truck for people who want the towing ability and also the roomy cab
Pos,Take it to Ford and tell them what happened The supercharger is 3 k and will be dropped down to 2 5 k its worth about 100HP You can probably drive your car for a few miles after there is no water in it but its damaging and dangerous The aliminum intake is worth about 20 HP and is a good base power mod if you are planning to go real fast in the future ex get a Vortechs Trim etc Ok I have reviewed the 97GT and the 89GT mustangs but currently I cant not_locate not_any not_better not_place not_to not_post not_this not_opinion not_that not_might not_save not_you not_1000 If you do a research for a recall on your 96GT you will find that there is one Unfortunately some of the 97GTs also came out of the factory with the weak manifold You can even burn your engine doing this And believe me SOHC V8 does get hot Ford recalled 1996 GTs and replaced the intake manifolds with more durable ones which were used on 97 and 98 GTs They will say that there is no recall on your car Act like you know what you are talking about and tell them you spoke to Ford and they said there is a program on the manifold The intake manifold on the 1996 Mustang GT was made of a composite material Unfortunately the material was not not_strong not_enough not_to not_handle not_the not_horsepower not_of not_the not_V8 not_so not_at not_around not_40 not_000 not_to not_50 not_000 not_miles not_it not_cracked not_Intake not_manifold not_acts not_as not_a not_cooler not_where not_water not_and not_antifreeze not_circulates They will change it within a day at no cost to you given that the manifold is indeed cracked Make sure that it is otherwise they will charge you 100 just for looking at it Also you can get the SVO supercharger or the aliminum SVO intake with a 500 discount if you loose your manifold There is no recall on the 97GT and quite a few people have spent 1000 bucks on a new intake because of this Here is what Ford wont tell you The intake manifold is really their problem and even if your car is out of warranty its their responsibility to replace it If you own a 97GT and your intake cracks do not not_pay not_for not_a not_new not_intake
Pos,The 4 6s is just as satisfying Hey im 36 and the harshness issue suddenly seems important The warranty expressly excludes any damage due to overheat conditions The ABS is what you d expect That fact alone illustrates the difference in their personalities But the 91 was a 16 000 car not not_a not_23 not_000 not_one The new ones inspire that kind of confidence without the harshness The 4 6L is all aluminum so beware of engine heat conditions The 2000s exhaust note is awesome and a little lower than the 98s The structural rigidity does wonders for enhancing the ride and the control From my vantage point it is unchanged from my wifes 98 Interesting side note My 2000 is a GT coupe with leather auto 17 wheels and the Mach 460 sound system It has that great throaty quality and sounds very much like the 5 0L at idle If you see the radiator warning light come on stop immediately and get out the tow truck You get the picture though My 2000 seems much tighter and quieter and the body seams are excellent The 5 0L launches off the line brutishly and pulls like a freight train while revving below 4500 RPM Oh no now I ll get all those economist emails reminding me to adjust for inflation or the GNP The GT option also provides 2 new since the 1999 2000 models features for the Mustang ABS amp Electronic Traction Control Well maybe now my forehead bruises from reaching into the back seats and banging into those stupid loops will heal My muffler technician described the 5 0 Mustang exhaust as one of the best looking best sounding stock exhaust systems out there It all comes down to value br br It is modern without being quirky and very functional Comfort abounds and I really dont not_have not_any not_criticisms That instrumentation includes a speedo duh a tachometer temperature gauge oil pressure gauge fuel level gauge duh again and ammeter The 4 6L has a constant pull that isnt not_quite not_as not_strong but goes on and on steady and strong until 6000 RPM It combines the great throaty quality of V 8s with the loud growl of small displacement engines into a purely intimidating and obnoxious note Great looking pipes too Ford may be saving money by making leather available on only the front seating surfaces now my 91 had 4 seat leather Her outer side support cushion on the drivers seat is breaking down and there are some interior finishing strips that arent adhered well The structural integrity of the post 1993 models is excellent and maybe maintaining that integrity was at least a partial concern in not not_making not_a not_hatchback When you see the 25 k price on my Epinion keep in mind that it is 25 k out the door with every option available All of this is presented in an attractive and properly placed cluster that avoids all of that stupid gimmickery that plagues less thoughtful vehicles So maybe improvement has been achieved in that department Lets go driving The 5 0L has a 4800 RPM approximately redline and the 4 6L has a 6000 RPM redline Thats important im not not_GM not_bashing not_here not_but not_is not_anyone not_at not_the not_company not_LOOKING not_at not_the not_exhaust not_pipes not_when not_they not_re not_designing not_the not_cars not_Handling is excellent as expected As far as the modification potential of the 4 6L goes I cant not_say not_as not_I not_am not_a not_bit not_of not_a not_lightweight not_there not_and not_usually not_stick not_to not_stock not_Styling not_In not_Performance not_Red not_the not_heads not_turn So the new ones take a little getting used to in the way of letting them rev up Besides theres nothing like hearing a V 8 even a small displacement one smoothly rev up that high You can visit one of those online car buying services like carOrder com and take their 360 interior view virtual tour for the Mustang and what you see there is pretty much what you get no surprises That was a real hazard in the 1979 93 hatchback models Speaking of hatchback models I remain curious if I will eventually miss the convenience of the hatchback configuration I think I will So when you imagine you can shove tall items to the rear you usually have to break out Plan I would ve considered a hatchback model again if offered in a structurally rigid platform The 1979 93 models required you to do all the rigidity work yourself in order to get that kind of integrity After doing all that reinforcement type of work your car well mine at least finally had that flat cornering ride on rails feeling The car has 50 k miles and is exactly 2 years old now so maybe some of that is to be expected I maybe thought Ford would ve come further since my 91 which shared some of that charming shoddiness Well suffice it to say that the comments seem to be warranted as far as my wifes 98 goes Body seams are visually off some of that may be due to what is ridiculously complicated styling in some areas like the rear face The trunk access of the post 1993 models is not not_very not_good not_when not_put not_to not_the not_luggage not_test not_Perpetual not_jockeying not_of not_luggage not_items not_while not_half not_in not_and not_half not_out not_of not_the not_trunk not_is not_always not_necessary not_to not_get not_them not_in not_all not_the not_way Theres a low ceiling to the rear trunk area due to what I think is the rear speaker assembly The warranty also excludes damage due to lack of cooling system service go every year to the dealer and get documented servicing of your cooling system Yea theres faster for a bunch more money yea theres better looking a matter of taste but no car crosses the performance styling curve with the dollar curve quite like the Mustang My 91 was a hatchback and never quite had that new car quiet feeling due to very small rattles that became not not_so not_small as time wore on Speaking of rattles there seemed to be numerous amp negative comments on the fit and finish of late model Mustangs and I was curious as to whether I would be impressed or not not_with not_the not_assembly not_quality not_of not_my not_2000 And no option package has rear floor mats so be prepared to shell out an additional 19 00 for them Not a deal killer but irritating Other irritants mild for the interior include the lack of glove box light im nitpicking here and the seat belt loops attached to the seat backs must go I removed mine and I hope I can do that without compromising the safety or operation of the belts The carrier bearings started making noise the very next day defective set did I break em on my abuse session are they of a weak design I dunno 2 Gas mileage is at 22 1 with a 50 50 mix of town driving amp freeway raging All town miles will yield just under 20 and all freeway excluding stop and go commutes will get you around 24 Not bad at all 3 The rear seat back fold down trunk entry feature is a real plus I guess im getting older because I care about the stereo in a sports car the Mustangs Mach 460 system is heaven no complaints here All in all the interior is a comfortable thoughtful and handsome package irritants aside Another interesting side note for the money the late model Mustang has always provided FULL analog instrumentation included in the base cost The 1999 2000 is a bit bulkier amp angular and more likely to appeal to the men sorry if thats genderist I didnt not_mean not_to not_be but it definitely looks great from any angle Exterior styling is always a matter of personal taste so glance at a picture and see what you think the car does seems to look better with more time spent looking at it The interior is a carry over with subtle refinements from the 1994 re style No digital stuff excluding the odometer that will burn out blink and stop working No overly large speedo temp and fuel level gauges that are large in order to hide the fact that all 673 000 engine sensors are wired into a single service engine soon ok im GM bashing sorry light With the Mustangs gauge cluster you can monitor the traditional engine conditions without worrying about a catastrophe coming without any warning Hey FINALLY the Mustang has a low fuel light Side view visibility is awesome now thanks to the revised roof line shape and the quarter window placement Those are option packages provide all the extra stuff included with the option package price the GT package gives you all the mechanical amp performance stuff to go along with the 4 6L the leather group provides all the electrically adjustable seat controls just for the driver though the 17 wheel option gives you the bigger tires amp wheel locks and the 460 package gives you all the extra speakers and cool stereo with CD Virtually all Mustangs come with the Power Equipment Group which gives you the power locks windows steering brakes amp mirrors Theres another Convenience Group which comes on virtually every Mustang which provides front mats air conditioning and rear defroster im not not_exactly not_an not_unbiased not_author

am a little dismayed at Fords putting H rated tires on a GT if you get the 16 wheels and making you shell out extra for a set of real tires I think anything calling itself a performance coupe should have V or Z rated tires at least Keep in mind that in pure stock configuration the GT can exceed the speed rating of H rated tires hmmmmm im thinkin Firestone 2 The Sequel happenin here For the mechanically curious 1 My GT has 5 000 miles on it now and ive been to the dealer once for warranty work on the rear axle carrier bearings I dont not_know not_what not_I not_think not_of not_that yet I had just been on a twisty N Calif coastal road where I thought I d see how spirited the car could get no abuse here just alot of fun The ETC is a system that senses rear wheel spin on acceleration now how would THAT happen and uses the ABS system to apply the brakes to the spinning wheel and uses the Electronic Engine Control system to temporarily de tune the engine to stop it from revving up until the wheel stops spinning Its definitely weird to experience the ETC system at work but I guess its a good thing thank goodness it has an off switch though So 25 k is about all you can spend on a well equipped coupe the convertibles amp Cobras would require more money I may have forgotten to purchase the lighted vanity mirrors but if my wife can live without em so can I thats got a genderist tone doesnt it Hows the performance I was skeptical about the 4 6Ls ability to carry on the Mustangs mystique and performance image but I am consistently impressed I am certainly no stranger to the push rod performance of the 5 0L and though the 4 6L is considerably different in its personality smoother amp silkier its performance is every bit as respectable as its predecessor Some people may dislike the 4 6s decided lack of harshness typically associated with old school pushrod engines but time marches on and the 4 6L will definitely win you over
Pos,The front seats are in a word unsupportive By far the worst thing in the new Mustang are its seats both front and rear The fit and finish of the car have much to be desired as well The BFG Comp TA tires are sticky enough to handle most situations while maintaining a smooth ride The dash is attractive but the instrument cluster can look a bit dated at times The ride is supple and firm enough to have appropriate and confident handling on smooth surfaces Although there are so many things to praise about this car its far from perfect By the way like I said before its a real head turned Guys and girls both like the styling especially of the convertible In case you re wondering it can be fairly convenient because the trunk has more than adequate space for storage On that note it can be attractive to more than just speed freaks due to its large storage space and ease of use So if the old adage is true about dating someone for their car you might want to consider this one Id rather drive cross country in a VW Jetta than this Mustang For short rides the front seats are fine but long trips find your back and behind sore and aching In a world where Japanese standards of fit finish and ergonomics have heightened the level of excellence the Mustang falls short of impressing me This torquey V6 makes lots of its power down low and has over 220 ft lbs of torque that makes driving a whole lot of fun coupled with a new rear axle ratio and rear wheel drive However because it still has a solid axle and hasnt updated its rear suspension to IRS independent rear suspension since its introduction it can get a bit spooky on uneven bumpy surfaces Aside from that handling characteristics are favorable with mild understeer They new edgy styling will last longer than the sedan like styling of the last generation and finally makes it look like a sports car Although the scoops on the hood and behind the doors arent functional they do give it a sharp appearance To put that into perspective the much revered 1986 Lamborghini Countach took a full half second longer in the 1 4 mile Kudos to Ford for finally making a Mustang that for once looks good Not since 1969 has a Mustang turned so many heads The all new 5 spoke wheels on the GT model are classy and sporty and coupled with the 245 45 ZR 17s help the Mustang to achieve skidpad grips of 86 Gs which havent been equaled by Mustangs before with the exception of the Cobras The Mustang rides surprisingly well for a sports car But with the introduction of the newest Mustang comes many improvements over the previous generations beyond your wildest imagination First off I should say that this is finally a sports car again Its got a revised 3 8 liter V6 and although still a pushrod engine makes a respectable 190 hp that hurdles the 5 spd coupe 0 60 in 7 2 seconds The rear seats if you can call them seats that is give you enough legroom if you re about 7 or 8 For real sized people you might want to hitchhike I would advise all sports car enthusiasts who love the feeling of RWD and gobs of torque to buy this car especially the GT V8 Mustang But the real fun is in the Mustang GT with the V8 Having the same displacement and sharing many of the parts with the former 4 6 L V8 it produces 260 hp up from the old 215 hp V8 in 1998 Coupled with the 3 27 performance axle it flies to 60 mph in 5 5 seconds and gets to the quarter mile in 14 seconds flat at 100 mph OK folks here we go for any of you that have been around long enough to see the introduction of the Ford Mustang in 1964 officially released as a 1964 1 2 model I feel sorry for you Not because you re old bad joke please take no offense but because you had to see the Mustang go through a radical transformation from a true muscle car to nothing more than an expensive Pinto in the late 70s to an underpowered GT car in the late 80s to an even heavier sports car in the mid 90s
Pos,Talk about power and beauty in all of the right places The company also produces performance parts which would greatly increase the performance of your Ford Mustang For more info visit Saleen com The companys line includes other vehicles that range in the mid thirty to forty thousands such as Saleen S281 S351 sports cars Saleen XP8 and even the Explorer sport utility vehicle Wow The Saleen 2000 SR is highlighted by a 5 8 liter Ford based engine producing 505 horsepower and 500 lbs of torque mated to a Saleen six speed transmission With just about every part in this car specially made the only thing not not_unique not_about not_it is the windows Besides its great looks and mean engine the Saleen SR also boasts a starting price of 150 000 Although expensive every penny would be worth it because this special edition car has the reputation of Saleen and the reputation of proving itself on the track A little about Saleen Since the companys beginning in 1984 Saleen has produced over 7 000 vehicles more than any other specialty manufacturer has done
Pos,I love my 2000 Mustang The seats are light gray The car is an automatic It also goes off automatically The interior is light gray and dark gray It has park reverse neutral drive 2 and 1 The overdrive button is located on the gear shift The cruise control is located on the steering wheel My car has only given me one problem There is not not_one not_on not_the not_passenger not_side The interior of the car is a light gray The gear shift is located in between the seats There is a console in between the front seats This car has an automatic window defroster for the back window You want to go it goes The air conditioner has max a c normal a c and vent It has slots inside if for cds The windshield wipers are on the side of the steering column The emergency blinkers are on the top of the steering column The headlights are on the left side of the steering wheel It has lock and unlock for the doors trunk and panic button But they are ok The front seats are bucket seats The back seat is two different seats This is very helpful at night time to see the ignition The heater has defrost floor and mix Mix is the floor and defroster The driver panels are the speed oil gage temperature gage gas gage and the battery This helps in the winter time to defrost ice and snow They lay down to the inside This is also the same as the blinkers and the headlight brightner dimmer There is an interior light for when the doors are open The car that I traded in was a 1992 Ford Mustang convertible There is also a change tray located between the gear shift and the console That makes it easy to get to for the driver It is comfortable enough for my son The max blows a little harder than the normal Vent is just for outside air In case you have something in the trunk This car drives great This is the only problem I have had The car is great There is not not_much not_leg not_room not_in not_the not_back not_seat The brakes also work well The seatbelt warning goes off every now and then if you dont not_buckle not_your not_seatbelt not_up The cars performance driving is great My car has a spoiler on the trunk When you get out the light also stays lit until you lock the doors The heater air conditioner is a round circle that goes from cold to hot blue to red There is a third brake light in the spoiler It is a pretty roomy trunk for a sports car It is a pretty color I dont not_see not_very not_many not_of not_the not_same not_color not_as not_mine They have me sold on this little pony The trunk is carpeted and has the donut tire underneath the carpet The body is just about the same as it was when they changed to this body style in 1994 When you get into the car and close the door the light stays on until you start the car It also has lights that light up for different reasons like the seatbelt overdrive off or low fuel There is also a safety feature on the inside of the cars trunk The air conditioner vents did not not_turn not_from not_side not_to not_side not_I not_took not_the not_car not_to not_the not_local not_Ford not_dealership not_and not_told not_them The trunk has an automatic opener on the key chain and also inside the glove box When you need to stop and stop fast it does My next car after this one will more than likely be another Mustang Some cars that I have had before if you push the gas it is still going the same speed Not this one They looked at the car and ordered the parts I took the car back in and they put in new air conditioner vents The cars body style has not not_changed not_much not_over not_the not_last not_few not_years not_I not_has not_just not_been not_the not_head not_lights not_and not_tail not_lights not_that not_change It is easy to drive I love everything else about my car It takes off and slows down when you want to It handles the road good If you have not not_ever not_had not_a not_Mustang not_you not_need not_to not_drive not_one The car accelerates when you want it to It is a fun little car to drive The buttons are cruise coast and resume Cruise is to set it Coast to slow down Resume to go back to the speed that you were at before You might really want one after you do Thank you for reading Have a good night Kimberly The only thing that I dont not_like is that the seats could be a little softer than what they are I love the automatic seat for the drivers side There is a cord to pull in case you get locked in the trunk to pop the trunk from the inside The doors also have pockets to place objects in When I am out on the highway and I want to get up and go it goes That car gave me a few problems but I went ahead on and tried another Ford I was looking for a new car because I was ready to get married My husband went with me We both fell in love with this car I have a Bright Atlantic Blue Mustang He is only five so he is comfortable in the back seat Most adults would not not_be not_comfortable not_in not_the not_back not_seat not_unless not_they not_are not_short not_I not_have

The control panel for the cd player the tape deck and the air conditioner are all in the middle It has power windows power door locks cd player tape player cruise control automatic driver seat

Pos,Theres room for a set of golf clubs barely and thats about it so forget hauling groceries For all of the power the car handles remarkably well too as long as you are on dry pavement Let me start with one comment I have always wanted another Mustang owned a 69 10 years ago But I do enjoy being behind the wheel and after 16 years of driving I am still trying to figure out how I never truly experienced driving until getting behind the wheel of this car This car is the ultimate summertime vehicle Drop the top and go With the optional Mach460 sound system you will have no problem hearing your favorite tunes as the wind whistles by I am by no means any kind of motorhead so dont not_look not_for not_performance not_figures not_or not_anything not_else not_like not_that not_in not_this not_opinion Any little bit of moisture on the ground and look for the rear tires to slip even with traction control on I fear that this car will spend a lot of time in the garage during the winter months as I imagine the snow traction to be non existent I could give you about 100 reasons to NOT buy this car but instead I will give you the 1 reason to buy it It is FUN There is tons of power in the V8 engine the seating is comfortable even for a tall man and there is surprising room in the back for 2 young children I realize that I will have to give up the car by the time the kids hit 10 or so but until then the whole family enjoys it You re not not_going not_to not_be not_taking not_this not_car not_to not_the not_grocery not_store not_or not_anywhere not_else not_that not_requires not_putting not_anything not_in not_the not_trunk It came time for the family to purchase a second car Since we were already in possesion of what I believe to be the best sedan in the world a 94 Honda Accord EX I decided that rather than go with the SUV living in the Midwest this makes more sense I would get ME a car I ordered a 2001 GT Convertible 5 Speed manual After an incredibly long delay waiting for Ford to build my car it finally arrived early summer
Pos,We both love our mustangs Ford did a brilliant job when it created the mustang It would have been better if the mustang had four wheel independent suspension but it still handles very well The sound only adds to the effect Only people who can picture themselves in a sports car should buy a mustang One thing though you must be sure of your driving skills because one your behind the wheel you will really want to drive it The best part about owning a mustang is that the interior of the mustang Base V6 is the same as the GT or the SVT save the emblems When driving a mustang the whole sports car feel is there A stiff suspension a nice sounding engine and a instument panel that has gauges for everything One thing though You dont not_feel not_like not_you not_are not_getting not_the not_base not_model not_it not_feels not_like not_your not_getting not_the not_best not_model not_I not_own not_a not_97 not_v6 not_mustang not_and not_my not_roomate not_has not_a not_99 not_SVT The mustang is not not_as not_quiet as say a lexus but it isnt not_supposed not_to not_be not_You not_are not_supposed not_to not_hear not_the not_roar not_of not_the not_engine not_when not_driving not_a not_sports not_car It is sleek and powerful Just driving the car can make anybody feel young again Mustangs come in three varieties standard V6 GT version and SVT Generally it correspods to what type of engine you get the latter being the more powerful We know that not not_many not_other not_cars can keep up with us Say a mustang vs a civic or a mustang vs a prelude I think for the price the mustang is the best car out there Just knowing there is something powerful under the hood and the car is not not_just not_looks not_is not_one not_of not_the not_things not_that not_make not_a not_mustang not_great
Pos,The convertable has no problems The mustang has incredible road manners The new styling is both aggresive yet civilized The mustang is a great car for anyone The two in the back are a little uncomfterble The car handles quite well for seating 4 adults The new generation ford contiues in the greatness of the ford line No leaks or tough situations for up or down movement And a great drive through country winding roads The only down side to the mustang is its rear wheel drive For the exectutive or the person just looking for some style And with a low sticker price and high performance rating it is a great deal With plenty of power and tourque it has passing power on the highway The mustang is a car that can be owned by anyone In the winter snow can cause a small problem but wiht the available traction control deep snow is the only problem The trunk space is quite large because of the hatchback design of the car Holding about 8 on the skidpad is a very good score The standard engine the V6 is still very powerfull but to opt for the 260 horse power V8 in the GT is a worthwhile purchass
Pos,The hp is about 250 The car also sounds great with the classic mustang sound This car also excelerates extremly well and can beat out 17 year olds anyday If your in the market for a great ford car and you want a convertible get this car The 1999 model edition is the best one yet The top folds down quicker than ever and the car has been made ven more powerful The car is very appealing in yellow and where ever you go people will tur their heads and look at this amazing car When people see this car they wish to themselves I wish I had that car Over all this is a great car and everyone should get it
Pos,I drive a 2000 Mustang V6 It also makes the car lighter The seats are comfy and adjust well The sound system is good even with the basic system This car gives you a lot of bang for the buck The car handles well and is a dream to drive Of course rear wheel drive is fun though for going around corners The hood bumpers and trunk are of a composite material which means they will not not_rust The gages and interior is basic but doesnt give you that cheap feel like a typical GM car Sometimes the dash squeaks but only rarely The good part is the winter wont rust the car out but the car is lighter for winter driving with this car being a rear wheel drive put some weights and get good winter tires if you are to drive it in the snow The air conditioning is VERY good and so is the heating The back seat is short and not not_comfy for people taller than 5 4 The V6 will not not_win not_you not_an not_Indy not_500 but the gas mileage is very good and another thing this car is sexy The difference with this car is that it is easy to get parts for and cheap to repair Nobody should laugh at you for owning a Mustang Not everyone wants a rear wheel drive sports car but if you re looking for something fun take a look You can also spend more money like any other car but the aftermarket for the Mustang is awesome there are a lot of toys you can buy to make your Stallion fly Dont let anyone tell you Ford is junk Ford has their problems but so does GM Toyota Honda and whoever else
Pos,The STAMPEDE is louder than the HEARTBEAT The Mustang is more than just a vehicle The power was on tap at all times Braking was excellent As for driving one my test drive of the standard shift 2000 GT at the dealership was very pleasing The sound of the engine as I let the clutch out and drove out of first gear was so smooth and pleasing They spoke about them as if they were a part of the family and thats how I felt about my old Mustang It is a symbol of who you are I love the way people would give me the thumbs up when they pulled up next to me or the stories they would share with me at car shows about their Mustangs that they owned or own The most common phrase I hear is I should never have gotten rid of my old Mustang Well when it came time to purchase a new car I had plenty of choices but I knew I wouldnt not_be not_truly not_happy not_unless not_I not_was not_behind not_the not_wheel not_of not_my not_true not_love not_the not_Ford not_Mustang Why did I buy a 2000 GT Mustang well first I owned a 1969 Mach1 Mustang for the last 6 years and I can not not_tell not_you not_how not_much not_fun not_I not_had not_driving not_it not_This not_car not_made not_me not_a not_king not_of not_the not_road not_People not_would not_stop not_traffic not_to not_let not_me not_out not_of not_parking not_lots not_parking not_spaces and even to exit driveways I think they just wanted to get a glimpse of American automotive history The all four disc brakes were a first time experience for me and I loved it The handling was quite nice Sharp turns were point and execute no questions asked I felt like the car was built around me in the drivers seat Everything was within reach Excellent view of the road front and rear I cant not_wait not_for not_my not_new not_Mustang not_to not_arrive not_from not_the not_Dearborn not_Assembly not_plant not_I not_think not_I not_made not_the not_right not_choice not_Heck not_I not_know not_I not_made not_the not_right not_choice not_Mustangs not_are not_for not_anyone not_who not_wants not_fun not_performance not_and not_a not_little not_bit not_of not_American not_automotive not_history not_of not_their not_own not_As not_I not_tell not_all not_the not_Cheverolet not_lovers
Pos,What an awesome car Who knows maybe someday It was awesome before but now its even better I have owned my 2000 V6 Stang for 6 months now and am loving it more every day There really is just something about a Mustang Especially one that is powerful beautiful and sounds like thunder I added about 600 in add ons to my stang GT dual exhaust and a cold air intake MAC Products It sounds and feels like a hot V8 and is quite a bit faster that stock V8s of only a couple of years ago I have owned 30 cars 2 of them were imports and I have had 2 transmissions go out out on those 30 cars the 2 imports American cars are just as if not not_more not_reliable than most imports plus you get style and great driving experience Plus it would survive a wreck better most My 2000 Stang is the most awesome car to drive that I have ever owned and it only cost me 17 000 with leather plus 600 in add ons About half the price of most comparably powered imports I am not not_blind not_to not_the not_negatives not_though not_Engine not_a not_bit not_noisey not_at not_higher not_rpms but when blended with the rumble from 3 dual exhaust its just fine Probably should get upgrade to 16 or 17 wheels from the V6 stock 15 but not not_really necessary I love the 5 speed and with it it weighs 270 lbs less than a GT with automatic and 240 lbs lighter than a V6 Camaro with nearly the same HP GTs feel heavier and I know they would be awesome to own and to upgrade but for 3500 less money I ll stick with my nimble V6 and have fun upgrading it here and there Supercharger
Pos,The 4 wheel disc brakes are smooth and powerful The V 6 has plenty of power for any kind of legal driving and will still pull hard out of the corners If you re going to put up with all the inconveniences of a tiny sports car it had better reward you with the top down experience The V 6 does lack the deep growl of the V 8 and the rear end looks much better with the dual exhaust A new exhaust may be comming next season My laser red Mustang is an auto with beige leather and power everything with a beige top Every time I drive this car I find myself appreciating it a little more When you put my 2000 beside an old 1965 you can easily see the inspiration for the design I made the long drive to find a perfect and rust free used Mustang convertible and the car is worth every mile of my trip The back seat is really only suited for kids or a duffle bag Having said all that there really is no other feeling like driving the classic American muscle car with the sun and the wind I would never have considered this car as a hard top My daughter loves the convertible and begs to have the top down I put her in after I put the top down and I find it easier to lift her in than putting her into out 4 door truck The power top works great and is quick enough to put up at a red light although it does leak a bit in a heavy rain I guess thats just part of owning a convertible I put this car away for the winter so I cant not_comment not_on not_winter not_traction but in the summer the stock Goodyears do an excellent job In March of 2003 I drove from Ontario Canada down the I 75 to Fort Lauderdale Florida to purchase my 2000 V 6 laser red Mustang Convertible I am in no way a Mustang fanatic in fact I know very little about Mustangs I do know enough about mustangs that I love all of the retro touches on the new body style The little 15 rims and tires bother me a bit on my V 6 There is too much room between the wheels and the fenders it looks like a 4x4 Next up after the dual exhaust will be to find a good set of used 17 GT rims and have the suspension lowered which is an inexpensive job My wife and I have a 3 year old and the car seat fits nicely in the back
Pos,I walked into the Ford dealer near my house and saw this beauty The only bad thing is the gas but im willing to overlook that negative quality and again I will say you only live once so have fun and take chances It has a 4 6 liter engine V8 and its power is unbelievable I had other sports cares but this one tops all of them in the area of comfort I absolutely adore this vehicle and recommend it to anyone with class and a desire for excitement and a little fast paced fun It was a Ford Mustang Gt Red with black racing stripes on the hood and leather interior I thought to myself for about 3 seconds then made a decision that I must have this car Its absolutely beautiful and its an experience to drive each and everytime I get behind the wheel Everyone stares at it and not not_to not_be not_a not_materialistic but it feels good to have something that people admire
Pos,To me this is what Mustang was originally supposed to be about a fun to drive car comfortable on longer trips available with a peppy engine that gets reasonable gas mileage I have the 190 hp six cylinder this car is nice and stable at high freeway speeds feels heavy and solid on the road handles well and seems so aerodynamic I love mine Laser Red automatic 4 wheel ABS good sound system standard nice cloth seats I like a sports car that is still attainable to most of us that is still in the average American budget Plus this car is back to what the Mustang was all about too many of our American cars became bloated machines that were nothing like the originals both the Mustang and the Thunderbird come to mind I love both of these cars though I cant not_see not_myself not_absolutely not_giving not_up not_the not_rear not_seat not_as not_in not_the not_Thunderbird not_for not_2002 I love the Mustang my own personal car for zipping around with a usable rear seat nobody said HOW usable but usable
Pos,For years prior to actually getting a drivers license I have adored the classic 65 Ford Mustang Convertible How could I refuse to love those curves that massive design that glistening red paint and that spacious leather interior This brand new classic in the making has the fine contour or a machine built for speed instead of the luxurious comfort of the 65 version It was the car of my dreams from the moment I fist lay eyes on it Yes I admit it I was one of the many victims suffering from Mustang Madness I vowed that I would buy that classic car and have it rebuilt and restored as soon as I could drive As the years went by and Ford produced a new Mustang after Mustang that failed to inspire me I remained true to the classic 65 model and I counted the days until I could have one Now that the time to buy a car has rolled around Ford comes out with a stunning new look to the old classic When the brand new Ford Mustang first caught my eye I knew I was in trouble How could I stay true to the classic when this red convertible speed demon had hold of me One look at this beautiful piece of American car and I like many people was hooked Ford has finally redesigned the Mustang to do the classic justice Even though it was difficult to push the classic aside I am thrilled to see that the Mustang is back with a vengeance
Pos,This car is not not_cheap but it does move The only model I can write about is the GT Convertible loaded There is no equal for this car in speed and handling for the money It doesnt get thirty miles to the gallon but the fuel tank holds plenty It is not not_a not_stealthy not_car not_can not_you not_say not_highway not_patrol not_trooper not_but not_chics not_like not_em You wont want to drive on go out with your buds night but for just you or one companion it cant not_be not_beat Are you contemplating the Mustang I know I know it is a Ford But if you can get past that you wont be sorry And you may even find that the famous Ford reputation for unreliable poorly screwed together vehicles does not not_apply not_to not_the not_Mustang not_And not_by not_the not_way not_this not_is not_by not_no not_means not_a not_limited not_production not_car not_they not_build not_a not_zillion not_of not_them not_so not_you not_can not_strike not_a not_hard not_bargain In my never not_humble opinion it is the only way to go Now we will assume that you are a over the age of twenty five and under the age of fifty otherwise your insurance bill will exceed Sadam Husseins hooker tab or you are too old to be seen in such a I hope I dont not_look not_too not_old not_kind not_of not_car
Pos,The style and performance is unbeatable for the price The mustang is one of the sharpest sleekest best lookin cars on the road today I pull up to the stop light and next to me I see a Porsche Boxster If you are single and want a good car for good money the Mustang is for you But you see if I were in any other car I would sit back and stare in awe but I was in my brand new 2000 GT Mustang If you are lookin for bang for the buck then this is the car for you I got this car because I wanted a fun reliable car to drive around everyday I got both out of the mustang This guy in the Porsche was over there thinkin look at this guy thinking hes got a fast car well im going to burn him But when the light turned green i was gone before he could say a word I love my mustang I have loved mustangs since they came out They have always been reliable cars and so far my 2000 has proved to be reliable also
Pos,The 0 60 in this beast is in the low 5s The car is everything a person could want It has a nice 4 6 Liter V8 engine with 260 horsepower The space in the back is kind of small but it can still fit 4 comfortably The new 2000 Ford Mustang GT is an awesome car I own the car in Performance Red the new color for the 2000 Model year The thing I like about this car is all the looks that you get in it Its awesome The only thing I dont not_like not_about not_the not_car is the back seat but since I am the owner of the vehicle I dont not_sit not_back not_there Also if you are a big car fanatic like myself then there are so many different things that you can do to your car to make it different than others A new option also on the 1999 and 2000 models is Traction control which really does help I have noticed a tremendous difference which its on The options i got on my car was a 2000 Ford Mustang GT Leather Interior 5 Speed Manual and other options I just recently purchased the car and I Love it I paid just under 30 000 for it Overall experience with the car is I am 110 satisfied I recommend this car to someone that loves cars
Pos,To those who suggest getting a mini van I can only suggest that you quit making suggestions This SUV even if it never touches the off road environment is the classiest and most comfortable way to travel If you re reading this you re probably already aware of the specs for the Expedition so I wont retype them The added confidence of 4WD for winter driving makes any mini van just a glorified station wagon that is best suited for picking up groceries And the other issue about insurance costs well its true that you ll be safe in an accident but whatever you hit will likely be destroyed It would be so nice to be able to fold its third seat out of the way instead of having to remove it and stash it in the garage before running to Home Depot I hope this review was helpful to you Make sure you get this option im getting 13 1 mpg on a combined hwy city style of driving Not so great on the wallet but that is what you have to pay if you want a big SUV Its no worse than any other large SUV It has saved me on a couple of occasions by warning of obstructions behind me and is a great companion for when I back the truck into the garage yes it just barely fits in my garage I can easily back in and pull within 10 inches of the wall every time just by listening to the beeping tones of the warning system But isnt not_that not_the not_way not_you not_would not_want not_it not_I not_know not_that not_I not_want not_my not_wife not_and not_new not_baby not_to not_be not_safe not_in not_case not_of not_an not_accident not_so not_if not_it not_means not_an not_extra not_100 not_for not_insurance not_so not_be not_it not_Your not_insurance not_costs not_are not_a not_direct not_reflection not_of not_your not_driving not_skills not_so not_all not_of not_those not_reviewers not_that not_talk not_about not_high not_insurance not_costs not_must not_have not_some not_amazingly not_poor not_driving not_records ive read all of the other reviews posted for the 2002 Expedition and im amazed that most of the reviewers dont not_even not_own not_one not_yet not_are not_compelled not_to not_write not_reviews not_that not_are not_nothing not_more not_than not_retyped not_spec not_sheets not_from not_Ford not_Take not_it not_from not_an not_actual not_owner not_this not_is not_a not_great not_vehicle not_to not_drive not_I not_have not_an not_Eddie not_Bauer not_4WD not_version not_that not_I not_bought not_new not_in not_January not_2002 It is so much fun to drive I actually find myself looking for extra trips to make to the store just to drive it ive had all the seats full of people seats 8 comfortably and ive had it filled with lumber and other cargo Either way its 5 4L Triton V8 pulls it easily In May I used the tow hooks on the front to pull my brothers SUV Olds Bravada out of a swampy mess What I will point out to you is that the Eddie Bauer is the only way to go For about 4 K more than an XLT you get the 5 4L engine leather interior seat warmers MACH audio system digital temperature control exterior trim package very nice and lots more I got mine with 18 chrome wheels and I have to say its the only way to go One extra that was included on mine was the reverse sensing warning system A 200 option but worth lots more Of course its going to cost them more if they re a bad driver behind the wheel of a bulldozer SUV like the Expedition After you ve driven it for a week or two you ll find that its not not_very not_intimidating to drive after all and the turning radius is really quite surprising To conclude I will say that I love this SUV and will not not_part not_with not_it not_Take not_it not_from not_someone not_who not_actually not_owns not_one not_and not_disregard not_all not_those not_Pulitzer not_wannabees not_out not_there not_that not_have not_nothing not_better not_to not_do not_than not_write not_reviews not_about not_vehicles not_that not_they not_dont not_own not_For not_2003 not_Ford not_has not_added not_a not_new not_suspension not_that not_allows not_for not_the not_third not_seat not_to not_fold not_down not_flat not_which not_is not_the not_only not_thing not_that not_I not_would not_love not_to not_change not_about not_my not_2002 Let me also tell you that at that time his Bravada also had a 20 pontoon boat and trailer hitched up to it It was up to its axles in mud yet the Expedition gracefully pulled it right out without even breathing heavy at all I then towed the boat about 40 miles over hilly country roads and often forgot that the boat was even there because it handled it so effortlessly Now I dont not_plan not_on not_using not_it not_like not_that not_too not_often but it was nice to know that it could handle it My main objective with this vehicle to have comfortable seating for several passengers I need more passenger room than I could get with smaller SUVs so I only considered the Expedition and the Yukon Tahoe I love GM products but the Expedition costs about 5 K less when similarly equipped
Pos,The automatic transmission works pretty efficiently There is some vinyl though The rear of the car is a hatchback design The radiator has been replaced with a 3 core radiator This big HO engine gives almost no effort at 70mph They are called Steeda Whisper exhausts for reference purposes The car returned excellent response all the way up to 70mph So basically anywhere before that you wont feel barely anything My review is with the setting to 3 being the middle The settings are 1 for smooth ride and 5 for tight ride Ok first of all let me address the so called Whisper exhausts This is the revolutions per second the engine is turning In regular drive you ll be able to feel the car very accurately The rear of the car is quite small In overdrive you ll notice that the car will have very little acceleration response However these are easily overlooked they are just the little annoyances ive noticed When they give you a horsepower rating they should give a corresponding rpm number That is especially good not not_only for gas mileage but for the life of the engine The radio has been replaced with a JVC CD deck along with a trunk mounted 12 disc CD changer These on the outside look like the standard ones which almost hide underneath the bumper The rear wheels are almost sitting at the corners They dont not_realize not_the not_car not_needs not_no not_body not_kit not_it not_looks not_that not_good not_stock not_from not_Ford This means the car has a really good midrange which is the best to have The engine is a stock Ford 5 0L HO engine with the exception of new headers and under drive pulleys The transmission like all other automatics would kickdown a gear when it senses the gas pedal is depressed harder or more The middle storage box is very small and doesnt really hold much mainly just a pair of sunglasses and the little remote for my CD player As long as it has been maintained everything should still work even after 10 years Mine is an automatic transmission car The suspension has been modified with adjustable shock you can adjust how smooth or tight you want it to ride The car has been taken care of really well which enables me to make an accurate review of the car itself The exhausts have been replaced by Steeda with high flow exhausts but are not not_the not_straight not_pipe not_ones not_you not_ve not_all not_seen not_on not_the not_road The main problem with this is that most of the horsepower and torque wont kick in until the engine is spinning so fast Thats not not_too not_horrible not_of not_a not_problem but the fact is regular drive would be used more so it should come first The speed limit was 70 mph so when I stopped to pay the toll I floored it coming out of the toll plaza This was basically the case with everything else The car combines all out muscle with some nice features to be more practical The thing that really stands out is the costs Thus extremely low costs The reason for this is that depending on how fast the engine is turning the number of horsepower is different Obviously the higher the rpm the higher the horsepower It has all the standard settings but unlike the Japanese cars have the overdrive feature too I kind of hoped they would switch the placement of the overdrive with the regular drive The car is sitting on aluminum alloy 16 rims which for that year is the newly designed 5 point star design in opposed to the 1990 and before turbine style 15 wheels The reason for this being the last thing you want is to lose grip on the rear wheels However with some cars that advertise a great amount of horsepower or a great amount of torque they usually mean at an extremely high rpm such as 6000 or above If you ever lose traction of the rear wheels your back end would get lose and you ll probably go into a spin All in all it is really unlikely to find such a great combination of all features for such a great price The engine in the Mustang however is different ive found that im stuck to my seat from the very beginning all the way up to 70mph or more I did this little test one day on an empty turnpike The sound of the Ford 5 0L HO engine is actually REALLY distinct A trained ear can easily tell a Mustang from other sports cars even ones with similar sized engines To get the waterpump and serpentine belt replaced was less than 200 total including parts labor and tax The car comes standard with a 5 0L HO Ford V8 Which I must say is a fine piece of machinery Even though compared to todays 4 6L V8 which puts out 260hp the 5 0Ls 225 hp might seem very modest That would explain why I scrape the bottom of my car everytime I go over a speed bump and I go REALLY slow too Let me explain to you in detail what I have before I review the car I own a silver 1992 5 0L HO Mustang GT I bought the car used and I am the third owner of the car This is where most of the complaints lie I say MOST but thats out of very few total complaints you generally dont not_hear not_very not_many not_negative not_points not_on not_the not_Mustang not_GTs not_body not_design So speed lovers out there this is definitely one of the more rewarding cars to buy on the market Let me tell you that I am completely clueless on why they call them that the car is in no way quiet Instead it sounds like pure muscle not not_like not_im not_complaining not_its not_a not_beautiful not_sound not_Anyway not_on not_with not_the not_car This might seem like a huge list of parts but most of it besides the waterpump and fan clutch is part of the tune up and other preventive maintenance For my old car the Acura Integra a new distributor cap would have run as high as 150 On the Mustang the brand new distributor cap was 20 and change The front has very bold designing with the large hood area and the flat mean looking front including the awesome looking round fog lamps on the bottom From the side you notice the ground effects the most Most people have mistakenly thought that I put a body kit on the car However they executed it quite well One of the first things you notice about the back is the big spoiler rear wing This unlike the ones you see on Japanese cars teenagers customize is a functioning rear wing However dont not_disregard not_it not_just not_yet not_The not_5 not_0L not_engine not_gives not_out not_more not_than not_enough not_power not_on not_a not_wider not_range not_than not_a not_lot not_of not_cars not_ive not_driven not_I not_will not_explain not_what not_I not_mean not_by not_this not_but not_first not_I not_want not_to not_clear not_something not_up not_about not_engines not_and not_power If I was to get either the drive belt or timing belt and the waterpump replaced in the Acura Integra I would have been looking at a good 500 or more job Well since buying it ive had to give the car a major tune up replacing such parts as all the spark plugs spark plug wires distributor cap water pump serpentine belt and the fan clutch The sound of the car is also excellent ive heard 5 0L Mustangs with the standard exhausts and they sound decent but the real magic of the 5 0L engine is best expressed with hi flow exhausts such as the Steeda exhausts or the ever popular Flowmaster exhausts It has met all my expectations and more First of all I scrounged through the receipts from Steeda and I found that the previous owner had installed Steeda Sport Springs which effectively lower the car and the center of gravity This horsepower is almost useless in initial acceleration Most Japanese small engine cars that try to advertise ridiculous horsepower numbers use this technique read into it further and you ll find that it ll be at those extremely high rpms which is close to redline and can damage the engine if brought to it enough Also it is positioned too far back you have to bend your wrist a lot to reach the button and to flip it open then you d have to look down and back to see whats inside to know what to get Also I dont not_like not_how not_the not_trunk not_release not_button not_is not_located not_inside not_the not_glove not_compartment The way they have it configured now is from top to bottom Park Reverse Neutral Overdrive Drive 1st gear im used to simply counting the number of notches when going from setting to setting im used to one notch down for reverse then two more notches down to get into drive now I have to go three So owning a popular American car has really saved me a lot of money Cars like the Chevy Camaro and the Ford Mustang are so common and simple that there are a huge array of aftermarket retailers that deal in parts and upgrades for them This is because it is trying to be more fuel efficient Despite the lack of acceleration response this setting is really nice on long trips since at overdrive it accomplishes 70 mph with only 1500 rpms from the engine which is down right incredible Normally in my Acura Integra the engine will be spinning at about 3500 rpms to

enough good things about the features to let you overlook some of the slight annoyances of the interior After 1991 airbags were required as standard so the 1992 Mustang obviously has one which is a little reassuring after driving the 1990 Acura without an airbag for so long Also it has power windows power locks power steering power brakes cruise control everything And also everything works The

packaged together in a group covered by a grill like design so the light goes through in many tiny slots Its hard to explain but it is very attractive and like the body kit mistake a lot of people mistaken this as a custom thing done to the rear light but this is the way the car comes stock from Ford The more stress the engine is put through the shorter the life will be With the 5 0L HO engine you dont not_need not_to not_worry not_about not_that since it requires little effort to get the same speeds accomplished by Japanese sports cars I really dont not_have not_to not_speak not_of not_the

prefer at least vinyl It directs some of the air flow up and outward to put slightly more pressure on the rear wheels at high speed to maintain grip and to provide better grip on the rear wheels

Pos,The Paparazzi The handling and suspension are sheer perfection How ya like my curves i For starters these problems did NOT plague all 1999 SVTs But if you can get your hands on one Id highly recommend it You will immediately feel its power as you squeal off the line in first gear When the first dealership tried to sell us this car at close to 35 000 we walked But even more impressive is the monstrous pull of SECOND gear and this is where you will gain your greatest acceleration The slightly crowded backseat and limited trunkspace are hardly worth mentioning when compared to the overall perfection of these performance machines Authors note Beware of Lot Lizards The front seats are form fitting and highly supportive even on long roadtrips and front seat passengers can enjoy oodles of legroom Backseats are comfortable however rear legroom is limited As the proud owners of both a 99 GT and 99 Cobra we tend to disagree with much of the negative attention surrounding the Cobra and the rumored performance inadequacies i Lets clear up a few misconceptions Ford elected to perform these Horsepower Upgrades on a voluntary basis as a response to SOME dissatisfied SVT owners Fortunately some Cobras managed to come off the lot in prime condition and with the upgrades to the fuel chip intake and exhaust system WOW One thing to keep in mind when purchasing a Cobra is that due to the limited release only 3 500 per model year will be produced some dealerships will try to impose a surcharge of over 6 000 DOnt PAY IT Third is nearly as powerful and quite often you may find that you bark the tires when speedshifting from 2nd to 3rd Drivers may at first be startled by the subtle lift of the front end of the car when accelerating suddenly The independent rear suspension allows you to take ramps hills and curves at full speed with no lean or instability no turn is too sharp for this snake Shifting is crisp and quick and with each successive gear you ll feel all 320 of those horses just bucking to be set free We had been advised that it would be possible to lower the suspension up to 3 inches but have found this will not not_be not_necessary not_the not_slightly not_higher not_stance not_gives not_the not_driver not_an not_excellent not_command not_of not_the not_road not_without not_sacrificing not_handling not_capabilities not_in not_the not_least not_Fits not_you not_like not_a not_glove But lets face it this is a sports car not not_a not_minivan The Mach 460 Soundsystem produces excellent clear sound though you may want to crank it in order to hear it over the roar of the V 8 The Cobra and the GT are pure driving enjoyment both in daily traffic and on weekend excursions This has made the 1999s even more sought after at least down here in Florida where it seems there are more Mustangs per capita than anywhere else in the Us Some dealers still have a few left on the lot and ive seen price gouging even worse than 16 months ago when we purchased ours They re ALWAYS causin problems Much press has been given to the newly styled 1999 Mustang GT and Mustang SVT Cobra both good and bad We were originally attracted to the Mustang GT for its power and speed but had never considered purchasing one until the 99 model year the new styling with its crisper lines and more powerful engine were all we needed to fall in love with not not_just not_ONE not_but not_TWO not_Ponycars The final word Last but not not_least not_there is one positive result of all of the negative press surrounding the performance you will find that other drivers particularly those in other sports cars may underestimate the power of your car Just be sure to wave and smile as you leave them behind Authors Addendum September 28 2000 Our Cobra is a 1999 and

can easily hit the 60 mark in the advertised time it pales in comparison to the gut wrenching power and sheer G force put out by the Cobra Even prior to the upgrade the Cobra was on par with both the Corvette and Camaro SS although the advertised 0 60 times on these are slightly lower than that of the Cobra Our Cobra was even fortunate enough to leave in its wake a highly supercharged Supra equipped with Nitrous Clutch in let up on the Or was it Driving the Cobra requires a complete re education in shifting and cornering Most day to day driving will find you in 3rd or 4th gear reserving 5th for only the highest of freeway speeds
Pos,It sucks in the rain and not not_that not_much better in the snow Why cant not_the not_make not_the not_trunk not_deeper not_like not_in not_European not_or not_Japanese not_models Also drivers seat belt locks up sometimes and straps you in to tight But compared to the previous years model the POWER is finally a long awaited welcome to the new body desing But now with 190 HP on the V6 you get the respect that was long overdue So make sure you have your foot on the brake tight when you are at stop lights The trunk height is useless cant not_even not_fit not_a not_large not_suitcase not_in not_their May be deep but height is a real problem As with my 1994 ive had to do nothing but oil changes so far For the price it is still one of the best buys on the market It was getting embarassing driving beside the VW Golfs Jetta Passats in their V6 engines Not to mention the Hondas Acuras or the GMs and their peppy engines For an American muscle car how could you have only put 135 HP on the V6 engine But dont not_use not_the not_regular not_unleaded not_gas not_you not_get not_nothing not_like not_the not_power not_it not_should not_have not_when not_you not_use not_the not_premium not_Base not_models not_are not_packed not_with not_features not_that not_most not_people not_want not_Power not_driver not_seat not_Air not_Cond not_and not_Power not_Windows not_ABS not_is not_an not_option not_but not_I not_would not_strongly not_recommend not_it not_for not_this not_car Prior to my new mustang I had bought the 1994 model which was a new body design as with my current purchase Both times I was extremely pleased with my purchase Its always nice to get looks and compliments from strangers especially when its a new body design it just grabs attention I bought the 1999 Mustang V6 there is no major changes to the year 2000 model There are so many toys as well for this model body kits computer chips to boost HP exhaust kits etc I bought the 1999 25th Anniversary edition and Ford showed some class by sending me a 25th anniversary kit that included a book of the Mustangs history stickers and some other tidbits A few negative things I noticed so far is that in my automatic transmission after coming to a stop the transmission shifts back to 1st and you can feel a push jolt But still one of my favorites cause it is still rear wheel drive Dual cup holders that actually hold the larger fast food cup sizes now Well large lit displays with easy to reach controls I bought the model with the Mach460 sound system which is supposedly made by JBL it is sweet sounding and has a pretty hard punch to its bass Ride is quiet smooth for a sports car and the engine exhaust sounds throaty unlike previous years when it sound winey and wimpy Still it can be improved to give the growl even if it is only a V6 15 Tires are too narrow have to upgrade to at least 16 Gas milage is a concern it has gone down from my 1994 I spend about 15 for 80 Miles and that usually lasts me about 2 days only
Pos,Well lets see The Ford Mustang You have to special order the real sportsters They only market on the showroom floor the Convertable and Coupe Why not not_let not_us not_see not_them not_all not_for not_a not_change There isnt not_as not_many not_versions not_of not_the not_mustang not_You not_have not_the not_Cobra not_Coupe not_Conv not_and not_Boss The major thing I like about the new mustang the 99 model and 2000 is that they have increased the horsepower up to 30 hp dont not_sound not_like not_much but you get into a v6 and it feels like you are in a Gt No lie I once testdrove a Gt and a v6 It goes way back in history as a muscle car of the 60s and 70s but still goes on today I have never had the thrill of owning a Ford Mustang and probably never will But my feelings will never change Back in the early 60s there were many types of mustangs coupe convertable fastback GT Boss Ex Now in the 90s and in Y2 K The power of a v6 was unreal and I really got excited as they put the extra umph I really like the older style but with the way the world goes everything must change some for the better and some for the worst I would surely buy a mustang if I was able to and really needed a sport car but for the hot rod at heart its the sure choice
Pos,This takes a little getting used to especially when most of the time it would be no problem to blow their doors off The body style of the 1999s is quite a bit different from the other two With a rounder body and square like head amp tail lights this is more like a Toyota body style If I had a dollar for every person that told me I love your car or cool car man it probably would be enough to make one of the payments Take a walk on the wild side with a new Ford Mustang Ford also sent me a fantastic gift package containing a three cd set of music from the 60s 70s amp 80s and a wonderful black leather mustang cd case as well as a hard cover edition of the History of Mustang Try and beat this deal The 95 was not not_a not_GT and the difference is quite noticeable during acceleration I would recommend the 4 liter over the 3 liter engine if you do a lot of highway driving One thing you may have to get used to is other sporty cars pulling alongside and begging you to have a race My first car was a 1967 Mustang 289 cu in automatic with turn signals on the hood and a black vinyl roof over yellow paint job Today this car would be the ultimate classic ride Now in the nineties I have owned three new Mustangs 95 97 99 and I believe that Ford is on the right track to making me as happy as the first one All three of these vehicles were five speed transmissions because I just love to drive Living out in the hill country of Texas not not_far from IH 10 it is easy to get down the road and make it to one of the big cities Never had a bit of trouble with any of these vehicles and I easily put 4 to 5 thousand miles a year on the first two With the MachI CD stereo system the road becomes a joy to own
Pos,This car takes constant care and is an asset to the buyer based on the look but can easily become a pocket drain So decide if you want to pay for the looks and repairs I have enjoyed the car but not not_the not_maintenance This card provides a strong handling of the road and can work for the driver but if regular maintenance isnt not_maintained not_on not_this not_automobile it falls apart When you first get this car Ford generally sends a package that is very impressive books and or memorabilia but remember this costs money and the company gets it from the price of the car
Pos,There are many perks to this car First off the Mustang is a legacy anyway This car has a lot of history Also I really like what they have done with this new body style As soon as I got in the car to test drive it I knew it was the car for me It has great power good handling good stereo system and I like the inside a lot better than the Camaro Not to mention the price tag on it was very pleasing too After all the nonsense at the dealership I ended up driving off the lot at around 18 000 Gotta give two thumbs up to Ford on this beauty I recently purchased a new Ford Mustang and have nothing but good things to say about it I had spent a lot of time looking at cars and doing research into what car I wanted I had owned a Camaro before and said I never wanted to have a Ford Well as I drove by the Ford dealership the Mustang just jumped out at me Something about that car really caught my attention and why shouldnt not_it not_have
Pos,This car is ideal for any sports car lover on a tight budget In my opinion one of the better cars of 1999 would be the Ford Mustang The new model Mustang contains a numerous amount of good characteristics which in my opinion outweigh the seldom found negative qualities The 1999 Mustang was given a change in body style from the previous year which most people find very appealing However the optional traction control system for around 200 works great by quickly restoring traction to the vehicle after it begins to slip The Mustang even comes with more than average room in the front seats for sports cars I myself am 6 2 and in no way am I lacking in room The only negative comment that comes to my mind in my reflection of the year I have owned my Mustang is the relative easiness to lose traction on even semi wet roads The new engine placed in the 1999 model gets 40 more horsepower than the previous year which gives the V6 model Mustang a greater 0 60 than either of its leading competitors the Pontiac Firebird or the Chevrolet Camaro On the down side like most sports cars who even have four seats one would have to be around the age of ten to actually be comfortable in the rear seats of the car The traction control system even comes equipped with an on off switch for those moments where a driver really wants to peel out at a stoplight and show everyone around him that the Mustang is truly a great car
Pos,The new Ford Mustang GT convertible is a very good car overall Also the back seat is mostly useless to any adult Only kids or small adults can be comfortable in the back Dont get me wrong I love the car and if I had to do it again I would buy the car again but this time i would get the 5 speed It has great looks great handling and an aggressive powerful feel I personally give the car a 8 out of a 10 There are a few things I dont not_like though they are There is a lot of road noise and wind noise with the convertible although the Horse power has been increased I still feel that the 5 0 motor is a better motor Auto transmission in the 1999 2000 feels kind of sluggish it feels like it takes too long for it to accept the power from the engine to drive the wheels I kick myself for getting an automatic every day if your going to get one go with the 5 speed it feels much more powerful
Pos,The new refined Mustang GT has its ups and downs This car is very sleek and stylish with its redesigned interior and exterior This car comes with a 4 6 liter V 8 that hd torque and agility of an American Sports car The cost of this car is fairly reasonable for a car like this but kinda hard on the checkbook The back seat is one of the downs because its too small for an adult to ride in its built for a smaller kid The old 5 0 engine is missed because of its horespower and awsome sound but this new engine is doing real good for its smaller size I like this car so much because its good looking and it drives like no other I think it corners the best out of anything ive drivin i also liked the manual transmission feel i feel in control of the car at high speeds and low
Pos,At any age if you enjoy going fast and feeling power behind the wheel of your automobile when you put your foot on the gas this car is for you Only downfall to this car as well as all sports cars is the lack of ability to drive it in the rain and snow without fear of losing control because of the rear wheel drive and lack of weight in the trunk area The 1999 2000 Mustang has got to be the most affordable sports car in it class Averaging between 18 000 and 22 000 for the basic 5 speed fully equipped model will outbeat any of it competition Just the sound of the engine in the 5 speed when putting your foot on the gas will take your breath away I am only 26 years old basically just getting my feet off the ground and always wanted my first new car to be a sports and the Ford Mustang my that wish come true with it price and incentive programs
Pos,For 99 The back end is a little light though The car handles very good in the corners Ford made many improvements to the Mustang GT More ponies more leg room and a body redesign The 99 Mustang GT does what the Mustang has always done A good sports car at a good price One problem this car is like a cat it hates water Drive on wet pavement carefully or the you ll be spinning like a disco ball It ran as smooth as can be If any law enforcement personnel are reading this I did this test on the track as far as you know The back end wants to swing out when you turn fast and hard but what im talking about here is VERY extreme cornering Normal sports car corners are no problem This doesnt handle like a Corvette but its less then half the price For the price this is probably the best deal for your money ive had this up to top speed 147 MPH on the speedo
Pos,I have an electric green 1999 ford mustang and I love it It is my first car and it is a great first car It handles great gets great gas milage easy to drive I would reccomend it to anyone that wants a reliable fun and easy driving vehicle At first not not_being not_comfortable not_with not_driving got me worried about having a sports car but it handles great and rides as smooth as anything I love everything about it especially the color because it is different The only fault that I can say about this car is that it is not not_a not_family not_car not_it not_is not_good not_for not_one not_or not_two not_people but if you have kids it is probabaly not not_the not_best not_choice but besides that I love it and it is very comfortable in the front
Pos,I bought my 1992 Escort GT over three years ago The hatchback allows an ample amount of space for groceries luggage even large items The body interior engine and transmission of my car are all in excellent condition for their age The available power is plentiful and the car coupled with a manual really does return a satisfying driving experience With the seats folded down ive been able to transport 27 televisions as well as an assortment of other things all at the same time The only major mechanical problem I had was when the timing belt snapped but that should have been replaced at 65 000 miles which it wasnt As with all used cars do a thorough inspection of all fascets of the automobile before purchasing it and I suspect you will find a reliable cheap economical yet fun automobile Another thing a potential buyer should be aware of the GT model of this car has the underpinnings of a Mazda Protege Furthermore replacement parts for this car commonly come from a Mazda dealership or an independent foreign auto parts supplier Two sore spots for my particular car have been the brakes and an odd electrical problem that causes the car to stall ive replaced three out of four brake calipers and have had no success in tracking down the electrical problem The interior ergonomics are good with the placement of the air conditioning and stereo within arms reach Each door features storage compartments as well as the large glove box Since this is a coupe entry to the back seat can be difficult for adults The powerplant is all Mazda electronics including the starter another replacement I have made Overall I didnt not_expect not_the not_phenomenal not_reliability not_my not_particular not_car not_has not_afforded not_me not_Besides not_the not_infrequent not_electrical not_problem not_the not_car not_has not_rarely not_had not_any not_mechanical not_problems It had a little under 60 000 miles on it which was less than it should have I bought it because it fit my budget but was still sporty After living with this car I can recommend it to other buyers As far as driving it is a very pleasant vehicle relatively quiet very secure and stable I have a manual transmission and the engine revs through the power band eagerly Redline is at 7000 which allows a quick launch and an impressive sprint to 60 Torque steer can be felt particularly during hard acceleration or turning but it isnt not_unreasonable
Pos,These cars are virtually indestructible for American manufactured autos These will no doubt be collector items for your children These are all essentially the same cars given differences for model years I have owned a 1985 Ford T Bird 1992 Mercury Cougar and now a 1997 Ford T Bird These were spiffy road cruisers with good looks good gas mileage and performed well for their size If you can find a low mileage 97 they make a great second or even your main vehicle Or you are forced to buy an even pricier Ford Crown Victoria or Mercury Grand Marquis if you like larger and safer aut o This indicates a well built close tolerance engine designed to last Alas they are not not_made not_anymore not_Ford not_realized not_they not_could not_make not_and not_sell not_a not_Ford not_Taurus not_Mercury not_Sable not_a not_smaller not_car not_and not_less not_costly not_to not_produce not_and not_sell not_it not_for not_more not_profit not_than not_they not_ever not_saw not_on not_the not_T not_Birds not_or not_Cougars The 85 went 128 K miles the 92 was at 113 K miles when they were sold and the 97 is at 45 k miles I had no major breakdowns on any of these and I was always impressed that when they were emissions tested required in most states even at high mileage each tested well within the clean air standards
Pos,You can tell we are Ford people It was bought without the automatic windows and doors for longevity We chose this truck because it was an upgrade of our previous Ranger The body shows no signs of deterioration and the engine still purrs little a kitten Then we will most likely choose another F150 or upgrade to one of those three door cabs This was the correct choice since many of the automatic windows and doors fail long before seven years We intend to keep this truck for another three to four years or 200 000 miles which it will have no problem reaching If you are looking for a truck that is dependable low maintenance and fits in your budget try it you will like it This vehicle is not not_for not_everyone not_People not_who not_are not_under not_5 not_feet not_tall not_over not_75 not_years not_of not_age should not not_buy not_this not_truck not_unless not_they not_have not_a not_step not_stool We wanted a dependable truck which would out live the loan payments Seven years and 100 000 miles later it looks and drives as good as any of the newer models on the busy city streets and long Texas highways We have had no major defects other than an oil pan leak caused by a bad gasket which proved to be costly since it required the removal of the transmission to get to the gasket to be replaced Another short coming was the windshield wipers which were under designed too small for the truck which leaves areas of the windows which are not not_cleaned not_properly
Pos,We will buy a Ford still The seats are very comfortable even on long road trips My husband acquired the car from his parents in January 1997 All at once everything went wrong with the car For example a new head gasket costing around 2 K Id say that Ford recalled this car for about 6 different problems We should know we took many many trips in that car They bought it having only 50 miles on it in January 1995 There were some major repairs that had to be done It needed a new air conditioner new motor mounts and new heat core among other things They have found the same thing that we have time amp again We have one now We have learned from experience though The good point is that they DID recall it when they found a consistent problem However on most of the major repairs Ford did eventually recall the vehicle for that particular item The problem for us came in December 1999 when the car had 93 K miles We had the car until we traded it in December 1999 Overall it was a good car When we re looking for a nice sized but affordable short term car we will get a Taurus The car is great for the 1st 3 4 years Until we had these problems the car was a very good reliable car Thats when we decided to trade it in My in laws amp my family still buy the Ford Taurus If we re looking for a long term car that will be with us 10 years from now we ll shop in another direction By recall I mean that they refunded your money if you had already done the repair or repaired it for free if you hadnt The total for the repairs came to over 3 000 Needless to say we were not not_going not_to not_put not_this not_kind not_of not_work not_into not_an not_old not_car If you ask most people about a Ford Taurus their either going to tell you that they loved it or hated it You re going to get a mixed response from me If you are looking for a short term or lease vehicle then this car is for you If you are looking for a good reliable long term car 4 years or more then this is not not_the not_car not_for not_you not_My not_in not_laws not_bought not_this not_car not_brand not_new not_at not_the not_end not_of not_a not_model not_year
Pos,The Taurus is also a smooth car as is the BMW The BMW does not not_even not_have not_one not_although not_the not_Ford not_does One feature that seems to be taken for granted in a lot of cars is the cup holder I was riding with my father in his Ford Taurus station wagon today to get some matierals for the construction workers that are remodeling our home The seat comfort up front is comfortable in both cars however I personally like the back seat more in the BMW since it has head rests and the seats are contoured for the body The Ford is cheaper to get fixed although it seems that it often does need fixing usually nothing major A recent fix was the air conditioning which cost over 500 to fix It gets probably about 8 mpg more than the BMW when the BMW was purchased a gas guzzler tax needed to be paid I like the Ford Taurus station wagon and would recommend it for families In the BMW I use the area on the door to place the cups although it seems it was made for cassettes or CDs to be placed there Another advantage of the Ford is that it is very good on gas For people with families that travel often and need room for luggage such as my family I would recommend the Taurus For those who like to have luxuries even to the point of having a weather station built into a car I would recommend the BMW While in the car I thought it might be interesting to compare his car to my BMW 7 series A review of my car can be read at a href auto review 1E9A D8AFEF3 39277AA5 prod3 http www epinions com auto review 1E9A D8AFEF3 39277AA5 prod3 a Some interesting facts I noticed was that the Taurus actually seems to accelerate smoother and brake smoother than the BMW although the BMW does accelerate faster
Pos,There are leather seats This truck has a guaranteed bed It is a combination of both This is great for trailers power tools and camping There is also a rear control panel for the back seat passengers There is an overhead counsel that indicates direction and the temperature It will also let you know of sever conditions outside Such as icy roads or extreme heat Have you ever had to move and were worried about scratching or denting the bed of your truck Well your worries are over This has been one of the best vehicles that we have ever purchased Besides being a combination car and truck it has many more unique qualities It will never ding dent or rust Trust me it sounds like a gimmick but I have tested it and know that it is all the truth Ever went to purchase a vehicle and you wanted a family car and your spouse wanted a truck Well Ford has done it It is the Explorer Sport Trac It came with a hard top cover The Explorer Sport Trac came equipped with a V 6 But it feels like it is a V 8 It is fully loaded Electrical mirrors windows locks and driver seats It lets you control the heat fan and radio from the back seat I think that this vehicle is perfect for everyone Weather you are looking for a family car or a sporty little truck you have found the perfect one There is enough room inside for a family but then has a bed like a truck Once we test drove this we knew that we had to have it So thats what happened we got us one We recently helped family move and my husband had a tow bar in the bed This thing was sliding all around Every time that we slammed on the brakes it would hit the back of the bed and I thought there is no way that this bed is going to make it through this Well it did it There was not not_one not_scratch not_ding not_or not_dent not_in not_the not_entire not_bed not_Also not_there not_is not_an not_extra not_electrical not_outlet not_in not_the not_bed not_of not_the not_truck
Pos,To start off However it suffers from very poor acceleration The interior is the part I love Ford did a great job in stiffening the Explorer frame The only feature I dont not_like not_on not_my not_Sport not_Trac is the rear floor console And it isnt not_just not_the not_strange not_hybrid not_that not_causes not_it not_This not_car not_has not_character The engine is almost silent and road noise is kept to an absolute minimum at most speeds However I am very pleased with it so far and would definitely recommend it Initial concerns The back is sturdy but light the cabin is rugged but elegant this is truly a hybrid If you want this car to move you have to hit the pedal to the floor It has the aggressive front end style that Ford is putting on the 2002 Explorer Its got a sturdy rugged roof rack My model ran 27000 and I didnt not_bother not_with not_leather not_6cd not_changer not_tonneau not_cover not_or not_many not_of not_the not_other not_available not_features This will come as a shock even to those who frequently drive other SUVs RIDE 9 Very quiet comfortable ride However I will say that Ford has done a good job by marking the engine spots you would most likely need to access with bright yellow paint They also have a roadside assistance warranty for any unexpected problems you might encounter VALUE 8 Very cool car in almost every respect Unfortunately it is also very pricey Not enough space for groceries or other common items Poor acceleration Simple interior Cramped seats Huge size Bad ride New realizations Plenty of room when seats are down Poor acceleration Wonderful gadget filled interior Comfortable seats A little bit long but not not_too not_wide Carlike ride CONCLUSION If you dont not_need not_to not_use not_an not_enclosed not_cargo not_area not_every not_day not_and not_occasionally not_carry not_something not_dirty not_or not_wet not_this is definitely the car for you Its great for scuba diving and im sure many other sports would benefit from it as well When people get in this car they expect a simple trucklike look While the Sport Trac has rubber floors and water resistant seats its no truck A great CD stereo system white faced speedometer comfortable bucket seats power rear window and more leg room than a regular Explorer It allows people in the back to choose what music to listen to The problem is that theres no way for the driver to override it ENGINE 7 The Sport Trac engine can tow up to 5000 lbs It makes the ride very enjoyable and a far cry from other trucks you might encounter HANDLING 10 Incredible handling Very tight turning with wheels planted at all speeds I tested Emergency maneuvers are able to be completed with no problem It has exterior tie down hooks running the length of the bed Even the tailgate is different from anything else with the Ford logo embossed proudly in the center Prepare for plenty of questions from onlookers in parking lots and at intersections INTERIOR 10 For instance an idiot car pulled out of a parking lot right in front me and I was able to swerve and avoid it easily RELIABILITY N A Ford claims that no maintenance will be required but im not not_absolutely sure Unfortunately the car is too new for me to give an accurate review If the stereo is on too loud when you turn it off it automatically sets it to a reasonable volume when you start the car up again Keyless entry remote entry illuminated entry the list goes on The plastic texture on the dash isnt not_great not_but not_other not_than not_that not_its not_a not_beauty not_Since not_theres not_no not_huge not_empty not_cargo not_area not_in not_the not_back not_the not_air not_conditioner not_and not_stereo not_work not_very not_well Id like to state that im the proud owner of a brand new Sport Trac I spent a long time researching the available cars and this turned out to be the right one for me I found that almost all my initial concerns were incorrect and a couple innovative features took me by surprise EXTERIOR 9 5 This is one of the biggest head turners ive ever seen
Pos,You must have mud flaps in the snow or you get snow sludge on the rails There is a single CD player and cassette player in it Do people still use cassettes The dealer replaced the Firestone tires for free I think because they screwed up my order and I had to wait 5 months for my SportTrac I got it in December 2000 There is a drawback tho I have to call it a vehicle its not not_a not_truck you know Also I got the best color the island blue which is really teal In the past I washed my van perhaps once a year this one I wash once a week sometimes more often Can you see where im going with this The leather interior warms up quick the heat is top notch They are not not_included not_or not_an not_option not_when not_I not_got not_mine not_I not_got not_all not_the not_options not_except not_the not_moon not_roof not_it not_makes not_the not_interior not_roof not_lower and I am tall and the 6 CD player I have CDs at home but I enjoy the radio and I have 12 programmed stations to choose from It has gone through a snowy and messy northeast winter with no complaints so far I am no longer nervous about driving in the snow tho I still dont not_trust not_other not_drivers not_I not_dont not_hear not_the not_whistle not_that not_I not_have not_heard not_others not_complain not_about not_I not_find not_that not_I not_park not_in not_places not_that not_maximize not_the not_visibility not_of not_my not_SportTrac not_is not_that not_so not_wrong I always thought of a vehicle in utilitarian terms A car is a car if it got me from point A to point safely and without incident it did its job My Chevy conversion van did this without any trouble for the 8 years I owned it So why is it that this vehicle has changed my mind I chose this vehicle mainly because it was different from the other cars on the road It certainly turns heads I let my husband take it to work once so he could show it off to his co workers they were all very impressed or so im told I enjoy picking up my daughter at school but I am careful to look non chalant about driving this cool vehicle Perhaps in a year or two I ll let my son borrow it he keeps bugging me to let him While I realize that this is a new vehicle and it should be just as I wanted after all I chose it I have never had such an interest in a car um I mean vehicle I hope that my joy in this vehicle is long lived and only time will tell but for now as you can see I cannot not_say not_enough not_about not_my not_SportTrac not_And not_while not_I not_highly not_recommend not_it not_dont not_buy not_one not_or not_mine not_wont not_be not_so not_unique not_any not_more At first glance I thought it was weird looking Then I looked again and thought I can see me in one of those SUVs are so overdone now I dont not_want not_a not_truck not_they not_ride not_like not_a not_truck not_I not_cant not_go not_back not_to not_a not_car not_they not_are not_so not_short not_A not_station not_wagon not_no not_way And I was just so tired of the big van Yes the SportTrac fits the bill perfectly Not a mom car at all Enough room for all 5 if need be but with a 17 15 and 11 year old not not_a not_common not_occurance these days The interior is comfy the ride is smooth and quiet With the tonneau cover it is just like a car trunk yet I can fold out the cage and use it for hauling tho nothing dirty those things are for my husbands truck With the cage in regular position I have a place to put my groceries and they dont not_slide not_around not_in not_the not_bed not_I not_was not_EVER not_so not_tired not_of not_groceries not_falling not_out not_the not_door not_of not_my not_van not_and not_mini not_van not_before not_that not_The not_v not_6 not_engine not_has not_the not_pulling not_out not_power not_that not_I not_need not_Like not_a not_shot not_I not_find not_it not_extremely not_easy not_and not_fun not_to not_drive not_and not_imagine not_my not_surprise not_at not_turning not_up not_a not_snowy not_hill not_beginning not_a not_fishtail not_turning not_that not_little not_switch not_and not_sailing not_up not_the not_hill not_around not_the not_other not_vehicles ive never before appreciated the value of 4 wheel drive this is my first
Pos,The Sport Trac is a good compromise There is a little wind noise at higher speeds So I rate it high on maneuverability The oil pressure gauge is a disguised idiot light with only two positions The ride is a good one I would rate it quite comfortable The rear window is a power window with three positions closed open and vent The front seats are fairly comfortable but the seats could do better in terms of lumbar support The first time I saw a Ford Explorer Sport Trac I knew I had to have one We have found the interior to be quite roomy and have carried five people quite comfortably in the vehicle The floor of the vehicle is rubber but Berber carpet mats come with it I like this feature However I would state that I would not not_want not_to not_take not_a not_long not_trip not_with not_three not_adults not_in not_the not_back not_seat The 4 speaker am fm cd cassette player is a good one I would rate the sound excellent as well as the radio reception The cargo bed is smaller than a regular pickup but I have found it to be quite adequate A fold out cargo cage is an option In terms of gas mileage I get 16 18mpg around town Although I have not not_been not_on not_a not_long not_trip yet I believe I will get in the 20 21mpg range This is a good way to extend the bed to about 6 feet but I placed a hard cover on my bed and removed the cage However I installs and removes with a minimum of effort The thing that first attracted me to the Sport Trac was that I wanted a four door vehicle but I also wanted a truck I really did not not_like not_the not_looks not_of not_the not_four not_door not_pickups The air conditioner works quite well and there is a vent in the center console for the back seat passengers I tend to keep this shut off however as it is a little noisy In the latter position it is open about one inch Instrumentation in the Sport Trac is attractive I enjoy the thermometer in the center overhead console Even though it looks as if the vehicle is equipped with gauges this is a little deceiving There are numerous tie downs in the cargo bed which makes it easy to secure a load I have only had my Sport Trac for about 3 1 2 months but I have had not not_trouble not_with not_it not_All not_in not_all not_I not_am not_pleased not_with not_my not_purchase and would definitely do it again The rear seats fold down to give additional cargo space Unbeknownest to many the rear seats lock in place making for a more secure floor for packages etc Behind the seats is a minimal amount of cargo space for a few tools a jack and the like The Sport Trac is adequately powered and my experience is that it handles quite well One day a less than attentive driver pulled out in front of me and I braced myself for the sound of metal against metal However I was able to negotiate the Sport Trac to avoid the other driver Then I found out what they cost But I waited a while and finally got one that was reasonably affordable and well equipped Let me state right off that this is not not_a not_technical not_review not_I not_am not_just not_going not_to not_tell not_you not_what not_I not_like not_and not_dont not_like not_about not_the not_vehicle not_First not_of not_all not_if not_you not_want not_a not_vehicle not_that not_gets not_attention not_this not_is not_the not_one not_The not_Sport not_Trac not_is not_still not_rare not_enough not_that not_a not_large not_number not_of not_people not_do not_a not_double not_take not_when not_they not_see not_it not_and not_many not_will not_come not_up not_to not_you not_to not_get not_a not_closer not_look
Pos,The standerd features here are options on other trucks It was so impressive I bought the first one to arrive at Bob Dunn Ford Not only is there plenty of room for kids an adult of 5 foot 11 inch has plenty of room for comfort The rear power window is a great feature not not_seen not_anywhere not_else not_Granted not_you not_are not_slightly not_limited not_on not_storage not_space not_behind not_the not_rear not_seat just add your optional tonneau cover and you are ready for that trip to the beach Ford you have done a great job on the new Sport Trac The bed is slightly shorter than other competitors but all you need to do is drop the tail gate and flip up the bed extender With the optional extender your bed is now a full 6 foot With the ample 4 liter v6 you have plenty of power to pull your camper or boat Ford has done its homework on the new 2001 Sport Trac The Sport trac has the most front and rear seat room of any vehicle in its class Granted the other companies have done a great job the Sport Trac is a step ahead of the rest Negative coments about rear set leg room being cramped this is far from the truth
Pos,The turning radius is not not_so not_good The gas consumption is around 18 20 mpg not not_bad not_for not_a not_truck but not not_good for an suv The best thing is that im 6 2 tall and I fit in it comfortably Its not not_overly tall like a land rover or a hummer its not not_overly not_long so I can park in normal spaces in normal parking garages I bought my sport trac in 2001 and have used it hard for two full years and this is what I think so far When empty just me driving it its a little bouncy Since it is designed to haul loads without them the springs are a bit much so sometimes control is an issue for the same reason The look is wonderful because I can take it out on the town and not not_feel not_like not_im not_driving not_a not_pickup but I can also take it home depot and not not_feel not_like not_the not_idiots not_putting not_plywood not_on not_the not_roof not_of not_their not_cavaliers Finally the back power window that goes up and down is great for extra long lumber and for the dog to stick its head out the back Now for negatives I should have gotten 4 wheel drive because of the outdoor activities I do in it and due to the snow and ice This comes at a price though my short wife has a little trouble getting in and out I got the rear wheel drive version only and through a couple winters in Pennsylvania snow and ice I wish I had gotten the 4 wheel drive instead but at the time the cost was too high for me If that wasnt not_good not_enough not_my not_brother not_is not_6 not_5 and he has sat behind the driver seat and not not_griped not_I not_cant not_find not_anyone not_who not_can not_top not_that not_The not_bed not_is not_short not_but not_I not_like not_that not_I not_tend not_no not_to not_haul not_a not_million not_tons not_of not_raw not_steel not_at not_any not_given not_time not_but not_I not_do not_throw not_lots not_of not_camping not_equipment not_in not_the not_bed not_or not_bicycles not_or not_my not_mud not_covered not_dog not_and not_it not_works not_great not_I not_purchased not_an not_aftermarket not_tonnau not_cover not_for not_the not_bed not_the not_dealer not_one not_was not_too not_pricey not_and not_I not_love not_it not_The not_bed not_is not_extra not_deep not_and not_I not_rarely not_need not_to not_take not_the not_cover not_off not_of not_it not_The not_fact not_that not_I not_can not_fit not_five not_full not_grown not_adults not_and not_all not_their not_gear not_for not_a not_week not_long not_trip not_all not_into not_one not_vehicle not_is not_great not_I not_have not_driven not_the not_truck not_through not_a not_dry not_and not_not not_so not_dry not_rocky not_creek not_bed not_to not_go not_caving not_deep not_in not_the not_woods not_of not_West not_Virginia not_and not_it not_has not_amazing not_ground not_clearance
Pos,It may be tricky to get options though The truck buyer and the SUV buyer could both enjoy it To me it is the best of both worlds This option I would serious consider because one of the main purposes for me to purchase the truck would be to transport my bicycles I took a Ford Sport Trac for a test drive I really like the practicality of the design I am considering the Leather group option as well as the sun roof option The only consideration with the sun roof is the loss of head room I think the price is moderate but im sure there is room for negotiation To like this vehicle is a personal taste but I think it is very innovative and well thought out Reliability may be another issue but if it is anything like the regular explorer it should be fine I would expect this vehicle to sell well because it serves two purposes In the brochure there is more than one picture of bicycles with the forks of the bicycle attached to a bar that runs across the bed of the truck I have enquired at the dealership about this option and they are not not_sure not_about not_how not_much not_it not_is not_and not_when not_it not_would not_be not_available
Pos,For more info visit http www teamsporttrac com My friends whom drive trucks are amazed at the ride comfort The ride is smooth and quiet I LOVE the lumbar support It has just over 8000 miles and has never had any problems Its gotten me through heavy snows and I actually got to use it off road once in the mud with no problems This is my first non car vehicle ive ever owned and I absolutely love it It was difficult to pay as much for it as I did but I am very happy with the purchase and would do it again in a heartbeat The bed may seem short but it has never let me down ive moved my kitchen table chairs furniture and 2 Queen mattresses in the bed not not_at not_the not_same not_time not_Using not_the not_Bed not_Extender not_and not_the not_handy not_tie not_down not_handles not_located not_at not_the not_top not_of not_the not_bed not_it not_can not_carry not_a not_lot not_4X4 not_handles not_great not_too
Pos,It has electric windows and defogger which are quite nice If used correctly you can outrun a Mustang but dont not_count not_on not_beating not_higher not_level not_models This is very important to check out because if one of those coolant tubes break you re not not_going not_anywhere ive had my 91 Ford Probe LX for 2 years now Overall it is quite an excellent car and will probably drive you to the end of the earth This thing has breaks from hell it can stop on a dime and work the brakes pretty hard too Gas mileage is pretty decent for a V 6 and has all kinds of computer controlled engine efficiency systems The front is roomy the back however is for midgets and the trunk is bigger than you would expect Once you make sure everything is is running order it ll last a long time The car drives quite comfortable and smoothly although the suspensions pretty tight so you can feel bumps in the road Its pretty nimble too and if you re good you can drive yourself out of a bad situation with ease The LX is one of the few models to have a 3 0 V 6 engine Stomp on the gas and it goes when it has to These cars were originally built for rally races which means on the automatic transmission there is a manual downshifting button It has the first generation Probe body style which in my opinion looks better and much sportier than the second generation body I bought mine with 145000 miles on it and the major problem I had with it was the cooling system I had to replace the radiator heat sensing unit themostat and coolant tubes Though this is important to check out on any used car its especially important on this model of Probe After I had that fixed I have had absolutely no problems with the Probe Its a very reliable car always starts in the winter and has taken me on quite a few long interstate trips ive seen some of these things with 250000 miles on them
Pos,There were no integrated child seats The drivers seat is comfortable and suitable for drives of several hours The front defroster clears the windshield in short order Fan noise is average Miscellaneous Recently I took the family on a 10 day trip to CA In fact we just got back today after a red eye flight The appearance of the Taurus has improved greatly since the oval mania years Of course this improvement now means the car is average looking rather than ugly Id call it fun but it makes driving as painless as possible The cup holders will hold most normal sized cups but will probably not not_hold not_Big not_Gulps not_or not_larger The player did its job no skipping on bumpy roads AM FM reception was good This drive consists of solid freeway traffic high speed interstate driving and a 6000 foot climb into the mountains It may not not_turn not_any not_heads but it also wont appear dated in a few years In our car we had AM FM CD with separate controls for bass treble balance and fade The key fob has buttons for door lock unlock trunk open and panic honk horn flash lights The car takes regular unleaded All in all this is very nice car to drive I dont not_think The

weight more or less The road test During the 10 day trip we put over 1 000 miles on the car I drove about 95 of those miles There are two cup holders for the back seat that are also modestly sized Trunk space met our needs with no room to spare My wife had no complaints about the passenger seat and I thought it was fine during my short stint there Backseat legroom appeared average Why am I writing a review instead of sleeping Waiting on laundry so I have something to wear to work tomorrow The stereo sounded clear and we enjoyed listening to it both of our cars have premium sound systems so we re a little spoiled there too For the duration of the trip we rented a 2001 Ford Taurus SES 4 door sedan that had about 2 000 miles on it when we picked it up If there is no center passenger in the front seat the armrest is folded up and the center seat cushion flips around to reveal 2 cupholders and a general storage area Now revealed on the floor under the armrest are coin holders cassette tape storage even though we didnt not_have not_a not_cassette not_player not_in not_our not_car not_and not_more not_general not_storage not_space The rear windows only roll down halfway and the doors have child switches which prevent the door from being opened from the inside Child seat tether anchors are easily reached as they are on the rear shelf It was loud enough to drown out the kids if necessary Climate control was very good I didnt not_get not_to not_use not_the not_heater but the air conditioner works very well and doesnt seem to tax the engine at all We picked up a couple of CDs when we discovered we had a player in the car we didnt not_bring not_any not_of not_our not_own not_not not_expecting not_this not_feature and they sounded like well CDs We went from the congested highways of the San Francisco Bay Area to the wide open spaces of I 5 and the Central Valley to the Sierra Nevadas and the twisty roads of Yosemite National Park with side trips up to Sacramento and Sebastopol Road conditions were always dry Appearance comfort spaciousness Why is that there in a front wheel drive car anyway Interior storage space is adequate im used to a minivan for our family travels so maybe im a little bit spoiled when it comes to cupholders and places to throw things We had the 2 car seats in the back and only once stuffed someone in the back between them my mother Lest you think I have it in for my mother she just really hates riding in the front seat Her main complaint was the hump in the middle of the floor It took a little while to get a feel for the car normally I drive a Mitsubishi Eclipse but when I did I was able to safely navigate the turns at a decent rate of speed fast enough to make my wife tell me to slow down at least no one rode our tail We stored 7 bags in the trunk from my wifes behemoth suitcase to a carry on sized bag We were so tight that when we took my mother for a 2 night trip I could fit her garment bag in the trunk but her small carry on sized bag had to ride with the passengers I dont not_have not_specs not_speaker not_count not_wattage not_for not_the not_stereo not_system On the flat droning asphalt of I 5 the car tracked steady

Pos,The turning radius was a too little large My only other complaint was a minor build quality issue We drove from Las Vegas to LA San Diego and Laughlin All switches were easily within reach and gages were easy to read If I were to purchase a Taurus for myself I would opt for the 200HP engine The suspension provided a smooth family car ride held corners well and transmitted little road vibration to the cabin Nothing too fancy and not not_bland perfect mix for a family car The Taurus has a well laid out interior One thing I did not not_like was the operation of the AC compressor with the climate control system When I opened the trunk the lining material was pulled away from the sides and would not not_go not_back not_into not_place On a recent vacation I got plenty of time to become acquainted with the 2001 Ford Taurus 7 days and 1200 miles worth The base V6 and automatic transmission setup was good but not not_great I didnt not_have not_any not_problems not_climbing not_the not_mountains not_between not_California not_and not_Nevada not_and not_the not_transmission not_downshifted not_at not_the not_right not_times The exterior of the car has a modern look is is a vast improvement from the last generation of Taurus that looked like an egg on wheels The 6 way power driver seat was easy to operate and it did not not_take not_long not_to not_find not_a not_comfortable not_position not_Overall not_the not_interior is very generous with ample headroom and legroom The AC compressor is engaged automatically at the different vent settings leaving no manual AC switch to engage or disengage I prefer to have the AC switch separate because in mild weather I will turn the AC off to improve upon gas mileage In closing this was the first time I enjoyed driving a rental car Ford offers a good package of options at a competitive price Next time we are shopping for a family car the Taurus will be on our list As a tourist I found myself making frequent U turns because I was lost quite a bit and the car seemed to have a larger turning radius than similar cars in its class I ended up making a few 3 point turnarounds instead of U turns due to the large turning radius I was not not_able not_to not_accurately not_measure not_the not_gas not_mileage not_as not_all not_the not_driving not_we not_did not_was not_highway not_driving not_I not_averaged not_about not_28 not_29 not_MPG not_over not_the not_trip
Pos,Be sure to do your homework We liked the SEL model because it has a stronger engine You dial up the temperature via a thermostatic mechanism like your house We liked the wagon and decided to look into another Ford this year Let me say first that our family already owns a 1996 Ford Taurus Wagon Our 1996 wagon didnt not_have not_the not_best not_pick not_up not_I not_love not_the not_way not_the not_car not_controls not_the not_interior not_temperature The cup holders have been improved and work better than on the 1996 wagon we have There is a control button to pop the trunk which is great during shopping sprees This year we decided again to go with a Ford We purchased an SEL which is Fords top of the line Taurus There are a lot of internet sites that list what the dealers cost is Know it before going in We paid 200 over invoice We got the following options Side air bags Dual electric seat adjustment adjusts height and distance from dash Six CD device in trunk Traction control Leather seats a Ford promo that was free It is nice also that in the back seat there is an arm rest in the middle I have two children and now they know where their side of the seat ends I LOVE LOVE LOVE the keyless entry system In the winter when you want to heat the car the car knows to blow the cold air though the vents by the windshield until the air heats up Then it automatically shoots the air through whichever vents you ve chosen I also like that that the outside temperature is displayed I like the center compartment between the driver and passenger Also if you cant not_find not_the not_car not_in not_the not_parking not_lot you can make the horn beep or pop the trunk to find it There is a lot of trunk space and you can push the back seats down to get more space via the trunk I like the net they provide which can hold groceries in the trunk without having them spill out of the bag The only minor problem with the car is that it doesnt have the best gas mileage I cant not_remember not_exactly not_what not_we not_get not_gallon but it will say on the sticker
Pos,Or maybe oh who knows The bottom line is I really dont not_like not_this not_van All driver controls are easily accessible and gauges and displays are well placed The drivers seat belt has an unfortunate habit of jamming although no passengers have ever noted a similar problem with the other seat belts Or maybe if I had never gone from driving passenger vans to SUVs before purchasing the Windstar I would have like it more Maybe if my purchase of the 1996 Ford Windstar LX passenger van had been as a new vehicle instead of as a used vehicle with 35 000 hard miles on it I would have enjoyed it more The captains seats in the center have been a blessing preventing major sibling battles although the mid van controls for the heat air and radio which are available on one side only have caused more than their share of conflict The heater is powerful enough which ive not not_always not_found not_to not_be not_the not_case not_in not_passenger not_vans and the air conditioner does an amazingly good job of cooling the entire vehicle quickly Drink holders are smaller than is often necessary they wont hold a large take out drink but there are plenty of them Gas consumption averaging around 24 miles per gallon is better than I expected although it does drop significantly when primarily city driving is done The Final Analysis Now that ive detailed the features of my 1996 Windstar and my assessment of them I realize I dont not_dislike not_the not_van not_nearly not_as not_much not_as not_I not_thought not_I not_did not_Well not_I not_still not_dont not_like not_it but now I see that its more a factor of my personal preference than the quality of the Windstar I guess that makes me feel better But I suppose now I ll have to stop referring to it as that tank of a van im driving Maybe my kids are right about this one maybe I just need to get over it Thats a necessity around here and for me in general as a light foot is something ive never been accused of having behind the wheel Comfort is great for middle and back seat passengers with adequate legroom for adults Front seats are less comfortable with drivers seat adjustments being minimal but not not_completely not_unacceptable A four hour drive to the beach is manageable but a longer trip would require frequent stops Reliability is less than expected based on the reports I had read but not not_outrageous not_ive had numerous electrical problems with my Windstar including a phantom door locking problem and flaky door open indicators Fortunately all problems have been minor and were not not_safety not_issues not_Handling not_is not_typical not_for not_a not_passenger not_van not_with not_a not_slightly not_sluggish not_feel not_Driving not_on not_curvy not_mountain not_roads not_sort not_of not_my not_acid not_test not_for not_handling not_and not_responsiveness is not not_enjoyable not_in not_the not_Windstar It had 35 000 miles on it when I traded in my beloved Honda Passport for it I didnt not_want not_to not_give not_up not_my not_Passport not_which not_might not_also not_have not_contributed not_to not_my not_dislike not_of not_the not_Windstar but the Passport had a standard transmission and the clutch combined with stop and go driving became painfully incompatible with my very sick left knee Financial circumstances my knee and the shortage of gently used SUVs available in the Spring of 1999 led me to purchase the 1996 Windstar Selling Features ive already mentioned that finances were a concern when I purchased the Windstar Priced about 2 000 below any reasonably used and available SUVs at the time the Windstar seemed like a bargain I test drove the Windstar a Mercury Villager and a Chrysler Town And Country before deciding on the Windstar Comfort price and interior space were the major deciding factors as were the reliability ratings for the Windstar when compared with the other passenger vans A passenger car was not not_an not_option not_for not_me not_after not_years not_of not_driving not_passenger not_vans not_and not_SUVs not_I not_feel not_small and target like in a car My 1996 Windstar With a 6 cylinder 200 Horsepower engine the Windstar is powerful enough for rapid acceleration
Pos,The next year it got five stars in the crash test ratings If I buy another mini van it will be a Ford Windstar I bought my 1996 Windstar because it drove well and had plenty of room inside for my family The sliding doors shut firmly but are easy for elementary school age children to open I am glad I got the air conditioning in the back of the van I dont not_like not_that not_when not_you not_have not_the not_heater not_on not_the not_air not_is not_still not_cool not_coming not_from not_the not_vents not_in not_the not_roof not_I not_only not_get not_about not_18 not_miles not_per not_gallon not_I not_wish not_there not_was not_a not_console not_between not_the not_two not_front not_seats When someone pulled out in front of me and I hit them going about 50 mph the front end crumpled in the middle just like it is designed to My two children in the back seat and I walked away with minor injuries something I feel very strongly would not not_have not_happened not_in not_a not_smaller not_or not_less not_well not_built not_car not_Even not_though not_I not_am not_not not_a not_mini not_van not_kind not_of not_person not_this not_vehicle not_is not_great not_for not_a not_family
Pos,We own a 1996 Ford Windstar GL We are a young couple with two children The radio is nice in these vehicles too No problem getting around those curves or up the mountain This was our first car that we ever purchased through a dealer We love the fact that it has the seperate air conditioning in the back This mini van is defanitly a van that the young and old can both enjoy We have had it almost a year now and we havent had any problems at all with this vehicle So many times I have rode in a van that you were roasting in the back and they were freezing up front It is also nice that you can turn those controls off in case your kids are too little to understand that they arent just play buttons We took it on a long trip this last summer and the ride and the handling of the car was nice we even went up into the mountains and it handled great This mini van is exactly what we need as far as the kids and stuff goes but it is also sporty enough to not not_make not_us not_feel not_like not_we not_are not_too not_old not_LOL This way the kids or whoever can control their own temperature in the back I also like the radio controls in the back for the kids that way if they want to listen to something on a long trip they are able to use ear phones if they want
Pos,The Ford Windstar is a great minivan for those families out there that are always on the run I love it It actually drives like a car even though it is pretty large It has a nice look and is comfortable I have had this van for four years and it is still holding up I recommend this to anyone who wants a minivan that drives great and is worth the price I bought it for 25 000 and it is great I have had no problems with this car and recommend it Take it from me the Ford Windstar is a great van and worth the price
Pos,Now the warranty is out so we dont not_rush not_it not_in not_anymore The check engine light is out but the window is still giving us trouble My family fills that van when we all go somewhere together yet still everyone sits comfortably This is extremely annoying but as far as comfort and the way it drives I still love it We ve had it in the shop many times and they reset the computer and all is well until the next go around If there were one thing I would like to have had on this van it would be the now popular extra sliding door My husband of almost 2 years and I own a 1996 Ford Windstar Between us we have 5 kids so a mini van became a must when we got married I had previously owned a Plymouth Voyager but when I met my husband I had a small car We bought the Windstar out of necessity but I have to admit that I love the comfortable ride the opening hatch that conveniently holds groceries or surprises that I dont not_want not_the not_kids not_to not_see not_right not_away or whatever else I chose to store back there That would come in handy especially when I want to get kids in and out and would like to not not_fan not_the not_baby not_Another not_drawback not_to not_this not_particular not_van is that we have had continuous problems with the check engine light coming on and for some reason the drivers side window is now refusing to come down
Pos,Ford Winstars are the coolest minivans on the market well i guess as cool as you can get for a minivan All of a sudden all of the other minivans look alot like the windstars way to go to set the trend Fords minivan the windstar is about loaded with all the options that you can think about The come well equipped with a great safety package actually the best one out They have pretty good power and run rather well My Mom has one and its got alot of miles on it now and it still runs nicely the only bad thing is the transmission our driveway is slanted upward and when you put it in reverse to go down the driveway it pops into gear instead of just going into it That is my only complaint well that and they hub caps were so good that someone stole them from us but oh well we can get more
Pos,So we got it for about 4 000 off and I think my parents got it for about 16 000 in 1996 Well my parents bought a red Windstar from a dealer that buys autos at auctions and such and we got it about as brand new as a used car could be it had about 1 6 k on it and had barely been considered used by the dealer There is plenty of legroom for everyone and a space perfect for a cooler right next to the sliding door which came in handy when we went down to see the Huskies in the 2001 Rose Bowl recently Go Dawgs I recommend this vehicle to any family that wants a good versatile van that has some power V6 is pretty impressive for a minivan and has room for all passengers
Pos,The car gets very good gas mileage That secures the shoulder strap in place The interior is very roomy for a economy car The first was a bent louvre in the dashboard This translates to automatic seat belts and air bags The car has what is called passive restraints But it still has great pick up even four years later There is plenty of room in the front seat passengers There is plenty of width for two back seat passengers This car has an Overdrive gear which improves the gas mileage even more All three of the problems I had occurred within the first year It is always annoying when a car enters the highway at 35 mph For short stretches it is okay to let the car shift automatically One neat feature is that the back seats fold down to connect to the trunk But then I took it in because a clicking noise I heard while braking It made me pretty annoyed at the dealer however for keeping me waiting for three weeks It was a year old when I got it having a previous life as an Enterprise rental car You can however still use that concealed space to store smaller items such as oil jumper cables etc The four doors are more convenient for allowing entrance and exit of back seat passengers or for loading groceries and other stuff In this way longer items such as gardening timbers can be placed in the trunk without sticking out into traffic For longer hauls though it better to downshift to drive so as to not not_stress not_the not_transmission The lap belt is separate which is nice because you can then adjust it to fit your body This package entitles me to lube service at the Ford dealer for as long as I own the car The car does have less power in this gear and it will automatically shift down if power is needed such as going uphill This helps ensure that children or pets do not not_fall not_out not_As not_part not_of not_the not_purchase not_price not_I not_bought not_an not_additional not_package not_for not_250 My old tempo was on its last leg when our local Ford dealer was having a big sale I looked around and picked out a 1995 Ford Escort LX This is especially important when entering the highway from an entrance ramp I am able to accelerate quickly to enter at highway speed The trunk is quite roomy for such a small car Room will be diminished however when you replace the donut they call a spare tire with a real one The automatic seat belts are the type that drag along the frame of the window and lock in place as soon as the key is turned in the ignition But I cant not_bear not_to not_give not_up not_my not_car not_to not_get not_one not_of not_those not_new not_ones not_that not_looks not_like not_a not_colored not_squished not_marshmallow not_well not_maybe not_the not_Focus not_not not_quite not_so not_round The whole dashboard was replaced since it is all one molded piece of plastic For some reason that repair went smoothly and I did not not_have not_to not_pay not_a not_thing The one serious repair I had to do was also thank goodness handled under warranty Just had to pay the 50 but the repair was a 1 200 repair Though it could fit a family of four there is probably not not_enough not_room not_if not_going not_on not_a not_long not_enough not_trip not_to not_need not_luggage not_well not_not not_without not_a not_rack not_on not_top My car is white with black trim and blue interior Its sporty looking but not not_enough not_to not_attract not_the not_attention not_of not_police not_with not_radar not_I not_would not_recommend not_it not_as not_an not_economy not_car not_and not_for not_couples It had about 18 000 miles on it First of all I was surprised at how much pick up the car had At first I thought that was just because my present car had virtually none The whole head had to be replaced Something had come loose inside the engine and had worn a groove in the head Though you might think this might be enough to turn me off the car it didnt But actually the car ran much better and seemed to have even more pick up and more power than before I still have the car and still love it I should probably trade it in on something while I can get such low interest rates The steering was so sloppy you could make almost a full half turn before the vehicle did anything And every little bump jarred the wheels you had to keep a tight grip Not so on my nice little Escort About the only complaint I have is the warranty service The seats are adjustable for taller drivers and riders Headroom may be limited for people over about 6 ft 2 in As long as the front seats arent pushed back too much to accommodate taller riders there is plenty of room for the average height adults in back The air bags are contained in both driver and passenger side Even with all the negative press on the potential danger of air bags I am still glad they are there Both these features give me a break on my car insurance Another safety feature is that the rear windows will only roll down halfway You move the wheel just a little bit and the car goes that way This improves the cars maneuverability quite a lot I find it easy to avoid idiotic drivers on the road as well as squeeze into a parallel parking space A few weeks ago I had to fill in for our regular vanpool driver no rack and pinion on that van At the time it was rated for about 35 mph highway 27 mph city Depending on conditions I find I can get even higher mileage than that One particular trip I got about 45 miles to the gallon Keep your car tuned up and you should be able to do as well Using air conditioning lessons the mileage somewhat And speaking of air conditioning it works great In fact it gets cold and I have to turn the fan down to the first notch Sometimes I even have to turn it off I have never had a need to use the MAX air conditioning Circulation of cold air in the back is a little more limited though so if people in the front are cold vents can be redirected to people in the back It was about a 200 repair I had to pay a 50 deductible I understand this is a fairly common thing with car warrantys now but even if it is I dont not_like not_it not_After not_all not_I not_have not_already not_paid not_a not_new not_car

not_fixed This service is provided at every 3 000 miles or every three months whichever comes first I consider this a very good deal since a Fast Lube station will run about 30 a whack I have more than got my moneys worth out of this service Another thing I really like is the rack and pinion steering While I cant not_technically not_tell not_you not_what not_that not_means not_you not_will

Pos,On the highway the escort runs like a champ The first time I bought all new brakes pads and cylinders The second time I decide to buy new pads It gets wonderful gas mileage and it rides really nice and quiet Then as I drove my Escort more and more I began to realize how much I really did appreciate its features The biggest problem that I have had is the brakes I have spent a total of at least 500 replacing them It can really move if you want it to I have topped mine out at 135 MPH and it still managed its smooth ride At first I wasnt not_very not_excited not_about not_getting not_my not_1995 not_Ford not_Escort not_I not_had not_just not_turned not_16 and was hoping for something more along the lines of a V8 Camaro or a big muddin truck It felt like it was meant to be driven fast like that I have only had a few minor mechanical problems with it I have purchased a new set of tires a fan belt and a battery All my friends with those huge engines spend a small fortune in gas money while my little 4 cylinder costs about 6 a week on average I drive mainly to school and work but sometimes I take trips all over the nation to race my bicycle It has been over a month since the second trip to the shop and they havent squeeked yet I would recommend the purchase of a 1995 Escort to anyone who wants an economical quiet and overall nice car rather than someone who wants to drag race and spend 100s fixing it up to make it nice
Pos,The first reason was price This was extremely important because I drive 70 miles round trip daily to and from work There were two main reasons why I purchased this vehicle and why I will purchase it again When I purchased the Escort gas prices were just about where they are now approximately 1 25 a gallon This car was truly in my price range and I got a great deal from the dealer I purchased it from This vehicle has averaged approximately 37 miles to the gallon so it is costing me less than 2 50 a day for gas My car payments were right were I needed them to be at the time yet I had just purchased very dependable transportation and transportation that leads me to my second point on purchasing this vehicle Very good gas mileage When I drive my other vehicle it costs me twice as much in gas As gas prices continue to go up I would strongly recommend that people look at this vehicle for a very dependable and economical means of transportation
Pos,The usual repairs Other than that I have no complaints Other than that it has been oil changes brakes and tires This vehicle has been so good to me for the past 3 years The only complaint I have at this time is the drivers side seat belt This vehicle has a lot of room without being too large I hate driving tanks I bought this car specifically for work I transport disabled clients to and from job interviews The maintenance required is low I had to have a timing belt replaced at 85 000 miles It cost over 200 to have this fixed I have 3 friends who have escorts and this has been a problem with them also It is a very reliable and trustworthy car I never have any concerns when I take it on long road trips I hope others find this vehicle as enjoyable It has gotten stuck in the middle of moving into the lock position I had to disconnect the wiring at the base of the door Otherwise it makes an annoying clicking sound
Pos,You get about 25 mpg city and 30 freeway This is the car to choose There are many reasons for this they re dependability and they re comfort When you see a Escort Wagon they re usually bought as business cars ie Ikon or family cars My boyfriend has owned a 95 Ford Escort LX Wagon for almost two years now and it hasnt had any problems His car already has 185 000 miles on it from road trips to Santa Cruz and San Francisco a lot of free way driving but a lot of city wear too Ok oil change please or Give me a tune up If you re planning on buying your teen a car or yourself and dont not_have not_the not_money not_to not_spend not_loads not_on not_timing not_belts not_radiators not_etc Of the two years and probably 85 000 miles he put on it himself there hasnt been a single problem Giving it regular oil changes and tune ups is the only expense you really have The only problem with these cars if you want to consider it a problem is you can tell when it needs a service job Like some cars that try to let you know when they need service by breaking down this one gets a little little sluggish as if to say
Pos,The four years that my husband and I have been married we have driven a small compact car This car is FABULOUS I cant not_stop not_raving not_about not_it not_It not_is not_perfect not_for not_new not_parents The heating and air systems are outstanding Its great for the long trips back to my parents as well as the running around in town This car is prefect for small families especially new ones who are not not_ready not_for not_the not_mini not_van but need more room than what a small car can offer It is small and sleek enough to be simi cool and yet big enough to provide the much needed extra space I love it It gets great gas mileage and is so easy to handle When we found out we were expecting our first baby we knew that we needed a new car with more room I began having night mares of being a mini van girl and when I thought about getting a wagon all I could think about was the Big green Brady Bunch Goose I knew I had to make some changes in my life now that I was going to be a mommy but I wasnt not_prepared not_for not_the not_vehicle not_change not_Praise not_the not_Lord not_we not_came not_across not_the not_1995 not_Ford not_Escort not_LX not_wagon
Pos,Odd but also strangely cool to my middle aged eyes On our first test drive I actually rode in the back seat She immediately ruled out the wagon which left the sedan and the 4 door hatchback My daughter especially liked the big digital readout of the stereo and how close it is to the driver The space between gears is nice and short and the clutch action is smooth and predictable again nice traits for a first car The suspension has evidently been tuned by Ford to strike a nice compromise between a cushy ride and good cornering capabilities The taillights for example are not not_at not_bumper not_level but rather up in the rear pillars on either side of the hatchback glass Our first tank of gas returned just over 29 miles per gallon so it should be inexpensive to run On the highway the only complaint I might have is a bit too much road noise from the tires Goodyear RS A size 195 60 15 We drove one of each and decided that the versatility of the hatchback was a nice feature not not_found not_on not_too not_many not_cars The 2 door was out as I felt it would be more expensive to insure than a 4 door vehicle But since the car will be used mainly for urban commuting I don 146t see that as too much of a problem In addition the red of our car almost 147hides 148 the taillights altogether during the day Triangular headlamps at the front blend in to the character of the car as well The lease on our Ford Explorer was due to end in 5 months 150 my wife and I were planning on letting it lapse and replace it with another smaller SUV We hadn 146t thought too seriously about another Ford but realized that our daughter was going to be 16 soon so we thought that perhaps a Focus was in our future The same theme dominates the inside of the vehicle as well 150 there are lots of diagonal slashes across the dashboard and the organization of the stereo and HVAC controls is quite easy to master The letter from Ford Motor Credit changed all that Basically their 147 Early Bird 148 program would allow us to trade the Explorer in early with Ford making the last 5 lease payments if we bought or leased another Ford product The use of angles and curves that intersect are also interesting 150 beauty is in the eye of the beholder I suppose but no one in my family dislikes the looks of the car We test drove a Focus with an automatic and while that might have been a better fit for our daughter my wife and I both believe that you have more control over your car with a stick shift especially when poor weather hits That plus the looks didn 146t scream 147 Gramma mobile 148 with apologies to all grandmothers reading this It took trips to 4 different dealers but we finally found one that we liked a Sangria Red burgundy to the rest of the world ZX5 with a stick shift and ABS The only thing I find odd and it seems to be endemic to Fords is the lack of a redline mark on the tachometer Especially for a new driver knowing how fast the engine can rev before bad things start to happen is something pretty important Interior Space The only thing that takes a moment to get used to 150 and it is really only a problem if you have driven other stick shift equipped cars 150 is that to find reverse a ring has to be pulled up on the gearshift before putting the gear lever into that spot So off to the dealer we went Ford produces 4 different models of the Focus a 2 door hatchback ZX3 a 4 door hatchback ZX5 a sedan and a traditional station wagon Since the car was ultimately going to be our daughters she came with us to help pick out 147her 148 car In addition the automatic takes all the verve out of the engine you practically have to floor it to keep the momentum up Ride and handling are also above par While it won 146t ever be confused with a Lexus for ride quality or a BMW for carving corners the Focus can more than hold its own We 146ve had the car now for a couple of weeks and here are my impressions after 300 miles Styling 150 Interior and Exterior The Focus particularly in hatchback form has some interesting styling details 150 the car was designed when Ford was going through their 147New Edge 148 styling phase the late Mercury Cougar was also a product of this era The steering wheel adjusts for both reach and rake meaning the wheel goes in and out as well as up and down 150 this translates into a driver 146s seat that 98 of the population should be able to get comfortable with The gearshift falls readily to the right hand and I 146ve already mentioned the stereo and HVAC controls Sight lines are good there really are not not_any not_major not_blind not_spots not_150 not_again not_something not_important not_for not_the not_first not_time not_driver One last note 150 we got about 6 148 of snow last night and my wife told me that driving the Focus to work this morning was really not not_too not_bad not_150 not_the not_combination not_of not_the not_high not_seating not_position and the stick shift gave her the confidence to get to work with little or no drama Summary For not not_a not_lot of money about 15 K in our case we got a car filled with creature comforts power windows locks and mirrors keyless remote a CD MP3 player and cruise control safety amenities ABS and dual air bags 150 side air bags and traction control are optional and enough character to hopefully keep our daughter safe and happy for many years to come The first time my wife had to back up she had to look up in the owner 146s manual how to do this The Driving Experience In Europe the Focus is hailed by many of the car magazines as one of the best handling small cars available Here in the United States the Focus has been on Car and Driver magazine 146s 14710 Best Cars 148 for 5 straight years After driving the Focus I can see why these accolades are heaped upon the Ford For a small car it goes stops and turns quite nicely Our ZX5 has the 2 0 liter 147 Zetec 148 engine which makes 130 horsepower Completely adequate I must say Coupled with the smooth shifting 5 speed the Focus has no problem getting out of its own way My wife drove and our daughter rode shotgun I was impressed by the amount of room I had both for my legs and my head I truly thought the sloping roof design of the hatchback was going to restrict headroom but that wasn 146t the case Now I will admit that I could not not_see not_myself

Pos,The ride is extremely smooth This car is what I stated in the title This is NOT the 143 hp 2 3 liter PZEV engine for late 2003 or 2004 You feel like you are in a cockpit while driving I got the one that has 130 hp with the 2 0 liter engine Other hatchbacks or compact cars weigh more claim to give more miles per gallon and have a smaller hood area Expect costly and time consuming repairs in the long run with other little cars For my trunk I had to buy a 3 in 1 toolbox at the hardware store for 30 and a 4 plastic box at K Mart For a small car with great power and handling the 2003 Ford Focus is as good as it gets This is the best hatchback or compact car Now for the downs to put up with if you are single With a 5 speeds power can lag a little going up steep hills Passengers in the backseat will find little leg room Have up to one passenger regularly especially for long trips The front seat is the most comfortable I sat in Sharp turns and the power steering are great I get 26 mpg for phenomenal power Before I got it I tried out some luxury sports cars I see NO difference With its compact size it is easier to go between cars and fit into cramped parking spaces when necessary
Pos,It is an SUV for heavens sake The higher driving position and large windows also seem to make visibility better than our Caravan We intend to keep the Expedition until our oldest daughter goes off to college next year That new Selectronic transmission V 8 equipted Lincoln LS seems to have my name written all over it Then with only two of our four children remaining at home we may take a closer look at something a bit more practical Not only does is suit their need to not not_be not_seen not_in not_a not_minivan not_it not_affords not_them not_much not_more not_legroom not_and not_space not_for not_their not_bookbags not_soccer not_balls not_and not_extra not_friends After two station wagons and two minivans Chryslers we wondered if moving to a big SUV would be the right move Our question now is why did we wait so long We found out that not not_only did it fit nicer than our old Grand Caravan it was also much easier to maneuver into the garage due to its speed sensitive power assisted steering While minivans are quite practical for families with younger children lower floors easier entry walk thru access from the front seats our eight seat Expedition is perfect for our junior high and high school aged children On the down side our Expedition cost thousands of dollars more than the minivan and has averaged 12 7 mpg in the course of running the kids all over town Its rugged styling and aggresive tires are probably more suitable for at least a bit of off road driving but I dont not_know not_if not_more not_comfortable not_fuel not_efficient not_tires not_would not_ruin not_the not_overall not_appeal Although access to the far back seat is a bit cumbersome kids have a hard time determining which of three levers need to be unlatched to move the mid seat out of the way the slightly elevated aft seat offers all occupants a good view up ahead Our Eddie Bauer edition comes with efficient dual zone air conditioning with rear seat controls and radio CD buttons and headphone jacks which keeps them busy and quiet in the passenger compartment Before we committed to the Expedition we drove it home to see if it would fit into our garage
Pos,The sounds system pumps the passing power is awesome and the drive is smooth as silk The one drawback is the price of gas and with a fuel slurping V 8 expect many trips to the pump We bought the Expedition because we wanted something to accommodate our 4 member family the car seats shopping bags toys games and the occasional grandparent If you have the need head over to you Ford dealer and take a test drive you might just pay the dealer from the drivers seat and never get out The Expedition fits them all in nicely no problem and often all at the same time Roomy glamorous stylish and comfortable the Ford Expedition is ans U V of many faces Well maybe not not_PERFECT not_for not_cruising not_for not_chicks but that may be better since I ll have my two kids in the back seat But seriously the Ford Expedition is an all around great time Wash it up wax it down put on your Sunday best and you can show up at the most elegant of gatherings next to Ferraris and Bentleys and no one would look twice But with all the room stylish look and comfort the Ford Expedition hands out I wont be complaining about gas for too long and neither will you We own the Black Eddie Bauer version with the tan leather interior and it is elegance all the way home You can steer with one finger if you like living on the edge and the braking is no problem for even the smallest of parents Headroom and legroom are topnotch I should know being 6 9 I dont not_fit not_into not_many not_cars but the Ford Expedition was made just for me Throw your bikes in the back the kids in the car seats cruise to McDs for a happy meal and you ll fit right in It is the only car I know of with multiple personality disorder it doesnt know what the hell it is The Expedition drives with almost no effort whatsoever it practically drives itself
Pos,Two rear 3 person seats plus the two front seats make this an 8 seater Skis hockey equipment and in our case soccer equipment has plenty of room We bought it last year after our 8 year old Ford Aerostar died This is one of the best cars I have ever driven and one of the biggest There are a total of 8 cupholders although one requires that part of a seat be in the down position The back seat sits up an extra 6 over the front seat but the ceiling is also lifted 4 to allow for proper headroom The kids can plug in the headphones in the back and listen to their own tunes while the adults have a conversation in the front It has a keyless entry system and can be set to automatically lock when the keys get 20 feet away from the car im sorry to say that the Ford Expedition I am writing about is not not_my not_own not_it not_is not_my not_mothers If your kids want to listed to the radio but you would like a nice quiet conversation in the front just bring some headphones There are these very cool little air conditioning vents coming out of the ceiling which can be pointed in any direction or closed off completely You cannot not_drive not_this not_thing not_if not_you not_are not_used not_to not_driving not_anything not_smaller not_than not_a not_light not_truck not_which not_includes not_most not_import not_sedans not_and not_sub not_compacts If you swerve back and forth in your lane often get ready for an accident With the Expedition you have to keep it in line 100 of the time This car commands the road Not only are you sitting higher than you are in most cars this car is only 2 narrower than national highway specifications on minimum lane width There are a total of 4 headphone jacks two for each 3 person seat Both of the 3 person seats are removable so taking provisions on any trip is not not_a not_problem You have to feel powerful when you are driving this car you are in complete control of the road Well not not_only is this car have some muscle it has versatility convenience and luxury
Pos,The expedition handles it very well The new system will work much better I ordered a New Eddie Bauer in the Fall of 98 1999 Model We added all the bells and whistles ie adjustable peddles for the short wife power drivers seat for me 6 disc CD changer Always get all the toys because it helps resale I am glad Ford finally switched from the twin I Beam suspension The reason i waited is because of the HP increase and the Torque increase on the New Triton engine I pull a 23 Sea Ray boat which weighs over 4000 lbs and felt I needed the extra power to handle the load The ride is comfortable like sitting up above the other traffic especially at night Gas milage is not not_bad not_received not_13 not_6 not_mpg not_on not_recent not_trip not_out not_west not_I not_also not_own not_a not_1995 not_Ford not_F150 not_Eddie not_Bauer not_that not_does not_not not_do not_as not_good not_on not_milage so i guess the 13 mpg is not not_bad not_I not_waited not_for not_the not_new not_Excursion not_to not_come not_out but Ford kept delaying After looking at the new Excursion I am glad I bought the Expedition
Pos,We recently purchsed this truck after years of driving a small to mid sized vehicle this was a huge change Im very please with it I was a little worried about how I would handle a large vehicle but it is surprisingly easy to drive parking is a wee but tight on occasion but so far I havent had a huge problem But after having our 3rd baby we needed something to haul everyone around in I am not not_a not_mini not_van not_chick not_I not_flat not_out refused to drive one so my husband and I started investigating the SUVs After months of reading talking and searching we decided on the Ford Expedition Though my husband claims he wants to put a super charger in it I think not not_It not_has not_the not_3rd not_row not_of not_seats not_which not_was not_a not_huge not_selling not_point not_for not_me not_my not_children not_are not_now not_seperated not_and not_have not_zero not_reason not_to not_fight not_no not_more not_MOM not_hes not_touching not_me not_it not_is not_so not_very not_peaceful not_and not_makes not_me not_much not_more not_relaxed not_nothing not_worse not_than not_a not_stressed not_mom not_behind not_the not_wheel The only down fall is that there isnt not_a not_whole not_lot not_of not_cargo not_space not_when not_the not_3rd not_seat not_is not_in not_We not_recently not_took not_a not_trip not_for not_the not_weekend not_all not_of not_us not_and not_it not_was not_packed not_to not_the not_hilt not_especially not_since not_we not_have not_an not_infant not_and not_god not_knows not_they not_need not_so not_much not_equipment not_when not_away not_from not_home not_I not_would not_highly not_recommend not_this not_truck not_to not_anyone not_who not_wants not_the not_space not_of not_a not_mini not_van not_without not_the not_minivan not_look We opted for the 4x2 XLT version really no need for the 4x4 when driving to the super market and school plus thats just one extra thing that could go wrong in the future Ours has all the bells and whistles including the rear air which is a great thing when you have 3 kids in the back I was advised to get the big motor the 5 4 liter but we ended up with the 4 6 which has PLENTY of power and is much easier on the gas bill
Pos,It wasnt not_noisy The rear wiper stop working due to a loose wire The explorer wasnt not_what not_ford not_raved not_about It was like night and day the expedition handled nice and tight But I thought to myself lets see what happens in a couple of months There was a recall on the signal switch and on the tires which were rectified immediatly Over the two years I had this vechile I was at the dealer 41 times for recalls and noises It was very noisy lack of power and the new 4 6 overhead cam engine had alot of problems When I picked up the truck a day later and left the dealership I couldnt get over the ride Well after two years im still waiting Dont get me wrong I have had some problems but very minor When I went to the dealership to give back the explorer I looked at the expedition and I really liked what I saw I didn t buy it I leased it I leased it to try it out because I had a 1997 ford explorer and I wasnt not_happy Those were the only times I been to the dealership in the two years except for regular maintence I would highly recommend this vehicle to anybody who likes a low maintence vehicle But most of all I would recommend this vehicle to the big family or for the person who needs alot of room and wants a really nice comfortable ride instead of getting a big oversized chevy thats very tinny and sloppy The truck had alot of room Its standard equipment had alot to offer and the price seemed to be right Compared to the explorer where I was paying 443 00 per month and now I could pay 5 00 more per month for more vehicle
Pos,One other special is it comes equipped with a fantastic cd radio cassette system its truly a fantastic vehicle It truly saved my life and the life of the driver of the white car I drove that same Expediton for two years and 30 000 miles In a split second I was around the white car proceeding in front of it on a curve toward the superhighway I never lost control and everything about the Expedition responded better than any vehicle I have ever been in It went through snow ice off terrain encounters and was finally turned back in two years later I immediately went out and purchased a new 1999 Eddie Bauer Ford Expedition and found the same type of feeling of security and the fantastic ability to see around everything else and have heard a number of stories of expeditions that have survived tremendous crashes with the occupants able to walk away i first had a new ford expedition 3years ago 1997xtl silver i had never driven anything like it before it handled and rode like large car and not not_a not_big not_truck but the biggest surprise came on december day with the first light snow with five o clock traffic when a little white car slid in front of me from the second lane on an exit ramp leading to another superhighway With no space to stop and not not_wanting not_to not_squash not_the not_smaller not_car not_to not_pieces not_I not_swerved not_with not_complete not_control not_to not_a not_small not_space not_between not_the not_end not_of not_the not_lane not_I not_was not_in not_and not_guard not_rail not_to not_keep not_vehicles not_from not_falling not_down not_an not_incline
Pos,I Love my Ford Expedition This car is very dependable and comfortable But then what do you expect from CHEVY There is more than enough room for anything needed balls equipment etc The gas mileage is not not_the not_best but what do you expect for a big vehicle I purchased my expedition in August 1999 and have been driving it since I have two kids who are involved in all sports and this car has been the best for transporting them from place to place The expedition also has good suspension and brake pedals to adjust to the driver Before purchasing the Expedition I test drove other SUVs and I have to say this is the best in its class After being in the Expedition other SUVs felt generic to me especially the Chevy Tahoe It is a great vehicle to travel in not not_only is it spacious but all the extras are wonderful I recently traveled eight hours with my two kids and it sure was nice for each kid to have their own seat and their own air controls I even felt safe on the freeway
Pos,My kids are safe im safe and what else can I say im BIG Whatever I love being the biggest car in the carpool lane I love the way my window aligns with the McDonalds drive through window just right And I love that im surrounded by what feels like tons of ice green steel Okay I ll admit it I used to be a mom in a mini van and now ive become something even more dreaded a mom in a big horkin Expedition But guess what This car is a dream car not not_only because its comfortable and it drives well but also because whenever I drive it other people in itty bitty cars actually move out of my way Maybe its the way I weave precariously in and out of lanes or maybe its just because im in a car thats large enough to run down a Tercel and barely leave a mark
Pos,It cost is well for a vehicle this size too the car is equiped with a A4WD 4H or 4L so u can set up your driving style the car is also big enought to carry loads of camping stuff or boxes to work its acar suitable for every person a workamn or fun having person or BOTH this vehicle is safe i love the 4 wheel drive which is almost slip thru in the weather we are having right now driving this car is like riding a cloud the ride is calm and not not_bumpy i recommend this to tall people and people who love to half some fun on the streets the car can handle in tough situation like snow and mud the inside is roomy the back seat is even comfortable enough to sit in
Pos,That means among other things it still gets 12 mpg At 28 000 miles the car truck looks and drives like it did when it was brand new After several MBs two different sets of Jaguars yes one to drive and one to leave at the shop Audis mine never self propelled and other brands too numerous to mention both foreign and domestic I have to admit ive never had more fun or comfort that I get from my 1999 Expedition4Wd Eddie Bauer Id like it even more if the dealer could fix the AWD which when activated manages to blink the AWD ON indicator like a turn signal but what the heck ive still got 4WD Hi and Lo so im not not_really not_upset despite the 4 unsuccessful tries now they say they have the right parts in stock and will repair it next time I drop by for routine service And I still scrunch down in my seat when im in indoor parking garages because the combined extra height from the 17 inch wheels and the roof rack produces a nerve jarring 6 7 profile that some day may become a convertible when one of those overhead garage beams is a few inches lower than the sign at the entrance says it is clearance on my at home garage door frame is about two inches phew Recommended accessory a third seat prop bar that lets you leave the seat in while propping it up to reclaim stowage space For 49 95 you can get one at http www knoxx com Good sound system nice leather good trimwork and overall a very comfortable ride in town and on the freeway Its almost enough to make you believe that when Ford claims Quality is job 1 they mean it
Pos,We LOVE the way it handles We bought this vehicle because it was newer we got a good deal and it holds more passengers We tolerate the gas useage and its size can be a bummer when it comes to parking availability for compact cars We really can fit everyone in My husband myself and my son 6 and 300 lbs two step daughters husband brother and two nephews oh AND my dog Truffles We had an Explorer before which really was fun but the Expedition handles like a large luxury automobile not not_a not_truck not_AND not_its not_attractive not_and not_incredibly not_roomy There needs to be more parking spaces for SUVs since they are increasing in popularity Dont buy this car if you have no where to park it but thats the ONLY reason NOT to buy If you have to schlepp anyone around if you need space for cargo this is the vehicle for you I wouldnt not_part not_with not_it not_for not_any not_other not_SUV not_or not_truck
Pos,This car is completely backwards No fine volume tuning for you buster The speakers are very boomy and clear Yes thats an econo rental car as well This is a very attractive car from the outside They do stop the car confidently but shakes like hell The rearview mirror is small as well and barely covered the entire rear window If you wanted to downshift just hit the pedal HARD It certainly matches the exterior well with sharp lines and curves triangles etc The 4 speed automatic is not not_smooth not_at not_times but still gets the job done The cute little antenna in front center of the roof like most European cars do VW It looks a bit of a mess like someone just thrown it together These are the best speakers ive ever heard on a car being stock And even if not not_it not_looks not_more not_like not_a not_Picaso not_painting not_if not_anything not_else All say YES but when I checked all were still unlocked Hmm Oh well thats what happens after 18 K worth of previous drivers Exterior Then again it may just be bad slippery tires as they squeal even on mild curves like on and off ramps You can barely listen to the radio or even hold a conversation with your passengers But keep in mind this is suppose to be an automatic Automatics are suppose to be smooth and seamless Oh did I mention that the interior was funky I mean it SMELLED funky and a bit dirty too The front fascia looks aggressive but can still be mistaken for a Dodge Neon at night thanks to the position of the turn signals The only thing missing that would make it even more Euro like are sidemarkers Interior How can I put it its interesting The engine is sooo torquey that I squealed the tires very easily on dry pavement Keep in mind that this is an automatic The 1 setting is still very audible when the car is stopped at a red light and sounds as if you can still lower it a little more This is NOT ABS people as it isnt not_even not_included not_here not_Front not_plow not_for not_stopping not_this not_car not_quickly not_does not_show not_up not_with not_revenge not_however The back however reminds me of the newly designed Honda Civic except that the lights actually glow in a circle instead of a tranversed U Oh lets not not_forget not_the not_antenna Then again I may be driving it a tad faster than most consider comfortable which isnt not_that not_bad not_HEY not_my not_car not_doesnt not_squeal not_like not_a not_pig It looks very much European because it was designed there by the way and it also have the build quaility of one Not bad for a base econo car Ah yes behold another rental car review With my Sentra SE in the shop dont not_worry not_just not_a not_little not_fender not_bender not_I not_now not_get not_a not_chance not_to not_review not_another not_car While not not_spacious not_leg not_room is surprisingly adaquate as well Visibility does pose a bit of a problem the side mirrors are too small while the rear window shares the same problem About the only thing normal looking are the gauges Sadly the base LX does not not_have not_a not_tachameter not_which not_makes not_the not_instrument not_panel not_look not_a not_bit not_plain not_Front not_seats not_are not_confortable not_but not_not not_too not_supportive When you stop it comes back down Very annoying actually and fortunately can be turned off GM cars are having it everyone on their cars though Seen one on a Pontiac Sunbird too The locks are very confusing especially since it is manual as everyone HAS TO LOCK THE DOOR I cant not_trust not_anyone not_when not_I not_ask not_them not_did not_you not_lock not_the not_doors The transmission also allows the driver to turn off overdrive which does not not_allow not_the not_transmission not_to not_use not_4th not_gear not_I not_never not_found not_the not_need not_to not_turn not_it not_off not_really The car that was given me was just washed and clean with 18 K miles on the odometer Going thru the glove box reviled the manual which informs me that it is a 2001 model That gives this engine the power to move quickly from stops which is very evident from the moment you step on the pedal Acceleration is quick even when you are already moving When driven conservitively however you wont be able to notice it I guess the jerking is for those people who enjoy feeling it when they push the car hard The view to the back makes the car seem like it has a butt that is very jacked up And I do mean UP Seems the rear is pretty high for a compact car Creature Comforts The suspension is super soft considering the body roll and front plow For such a soft suspension it sure does let a lot of road noise in I have never heard such loud road noise It has sharp lines and curves much like a Volkswagen has Small 14 steel wheels with covers makes the car screem im cute as the body looks like it needs a little more support from a larger set of wheels The only real need for it is if you need to be in 3rd constantly like if you were towing something or dragging something from behind though I dont not_know not_who not_would not_be not_doing not_that not_whistles not_innocently Then again im sure Enterprise has a fleet of these cars anyways as they make great cheap rental cars Too bad the Prius cant not_make not_it not_it not_d not_be not_great not_for not_renting not_thanks not_for not_it not_sipping not_gas not_conservitively The body rolls as well when taking corners but nothing that would make the ride uncomfortable After all people who own this base car dont not_usually not_drive not_like not_this not_anyways not_Old not_Kia not_commercial not_Dont not_worry not_honey not_its not_a not_rental To open the windows you must pretend you are CLOSING it and crank it that way In otherwords you must crank it AWAY from you to open while in other cars thats the way to close windows manually This time it is the Ford Focus LX Although it doesnt say so in the back I wonder if this is the same car that another one of our beloved reviewers drove as it is the same Cloud Nine White colour and im in the same Bay area And for some reason saftey reason the steering wheel is a bit off from center making it awkward to drive once you notice it Rear seats are surprisingly confortable and was able to lull passengers to sleep in a long road trip Just let only 2 adults back there and no more please You may just want to get the sportier ZTS or the ZX3 hatchback Perhaps its the last driver that trashed it but the brakes are VERY noisey and feels uneven I say this because it felt like a warped rotor so I cant not_really not_comment not_on not_how not_the not_brake not_feels not_without not_finding not_out not_if not_it not_truely not_are not_the not_brakes The locks are LOCKED when

not_for not_attention not_sticks not_out not_The not_Focus is totally backwards Same for the window cranks The climate controls are a bit easier to contend with However the AC and recirculate buttons are positioned too low which makes it a bit of a hassle to drive and look at where your fingers are hitting The Drive im very surprised to find out that this 2 0 liter engine puts only 110 hp It must be the torque being at 125 lb ft 3750 RPMs The stereo is one item most will reach out for and it will only disapoint if alll you carried to your trip are CDs Standard issue radio cassette just doesnt cut it The volume is not not_very not_gradule not_as not_it not_steps not_up not_and not_down not_in not_VERY not_DISCRETE not_STEPS not_Going not_from not_1 not_very not_audible not_to not_0 not_gets not_you not_very not_frustrated not_as not_you not_cant not_have not_anything not_else not_inbetween The stereo also comes with an anti theft device how very insulting to car stereo thieves as a section of the radio preset buttons can be taken with you The whole anti theft unit can be stored like a pen in your pocket as there is a pen like clip built in Gee how thoughtful Strange thing is it does have one luxo feature which is the automatic volume speed control or whatever Ford calls it As you drive faster the volume gets louder This is very surprising as it is the most basic system with only 4 speakers on the doors Perhaps it is the placement of it Who knows most cars have the rear speakers on the rear dash and I guess putting it on the rear doors make that much of a difference Highs are clearly high while lows can be felt I could swear there is an aftermarket sub somewhere hidden in the car Now for the windows and locks all manual We had to yell at the top of our lungs Below 60 MPH however and its bareable Conclusion Only if you can live with it I say I sure do hope the higher trims fix most of the glaring annoyances of this car but just as I said about the Dodge Neon its a good rental Make sure you sugar coat it if you want to buy it I dont not_exactly not_know not_what not_the not_2001 not_price not_is but for 2002 the base LX is 13 220 but I doubt that price includes AC or automatic transmission I think as the other reviewer I mentioned who probably drove the exact same car I drove it was probably 14 400 as tested
Pos,The main selling point for us on this vehicle was the test drive Fortunately the gripes have been mild and my overall impression remains high I needed a vehicle with enough room to seat 4 people 2 in car seats The 5 speed transmission and clutch have proven thus far to be the smoothest I have used The car does not not_have not_a not_workmanship not_defect not_that not_I not_have not_found and has not not_needed not_any not_repair If you want ABS AC automatic transmission etc you ll need to add potentially expensive options You can check specs rebate information pricing invoice and retail check safety ratings compare with similar vehicles etc The car surprised me at how quiet it is and the ride was also good for a small car Gas mileage on the sticker was posted as 28 city and 36 highway If you re in the market for a small car you ll of course want to check out epinions com but might also want to take a look at http carpoint msn com homepage default asp The base engine is adequate for the flat terrain where I live but Id opt for the stronger Zetec option if I lived in a hilly or mountainous region I would also have preferred an extra inch of cleaning surface on the drivers side windshield wiper The exterior styling of the sedan version leaves a bit to be desired in my opinion but also contributes to two shortcomings I cant not_see not_the not_front not_end not_of not_the not_car nor can I see the back end from the drivers seat Pay close attention to this on the test drive as it may prove to be unacceptable to some drivers One thing to keep in mind when car shopping in this class is the list of standard options I believe Ford was a little stingy in this respect Aside from floor mats rear defrost interior trunk release passive anti theft system and AM FM cassette most of the other standard options on the LX sedan are very basic The mixed bag of driving I do has yielded almost 32mpg Driving position is comfortable and the air conditioner has been more than up to the job According to our insurance agent rates for this vehicle are pretty much average for a small car As a final bonus the trunk holds more than I expected from a car in this class although the high trunk probably contributes to the lack of rear visibility The only thing I was not not_impressed not_with not_on not_the not_test not_drive was the visibility but I ll get to that later A quick check to see how the car seats fit in the back and the rest was a matter of settling on a final price with our local dealer After owning the Focus for about a month I am still very happy with my choice but there are a few gripes I have with this vehicle Four doors was something of a must as the extra 2 doors help to make the process of buckling in youngsters go a little smoother I also wanted something that would be easy on gas as I do a lot of driving My search did not not_start not_out not_with not_the not_Focus not_in not_mind rather I looked at and test drove most of the cars in its class before making a decision
Pos,All the better to access trailheads Or for that matter higher insurance premiums This car gets 32 mpg on the highway I needed room in my car for our mountain bikes Surprise It comes not not_an not_option not_with not_an not_adjustable not_roof not_rack not_that not_was not_extremely not_easy not_to not_outfit not_with not_two not_bike not_racks There is nothing I dont not_like not_about not_this not_car however an all wheel drive option would be great because I do take it on dirt roads I absolutely love my 2000 Ford Focus wagon I bought it because my old car died and I really wanted an SUV but could not not_stomach not_paying not_almost not_2 not_00 not_per not_gallon not_of not_gas not_to not_fill not_one not_up not_all not_the not_time And really now how often do you take that 4x4 SUV off road People who should not not_buy not_this not_car are those of you who follow the adage Bigger is Better I have all the room I need Even if we do have kids in a year or so It is a blast to drive handles wonderfully and has alot more power than I expected out of a four cylinder car Very zippy I did get the ZETEC engine so it has a little more power than the standard engine I recommend this car for anyone considering an SUV but who may and shouldnt not_we not_all not_have not_reservations not_about not_their not_environmental not_impact not_Less not_emissions not_less not_gas
Pos,The seats are extremely comfortable The changeholder is high up on the dash and is very small its cumbersome to remove coins The cupholders are placed in an awkward position and make it a chore to remove your beverage All I know is that I adore this car inside and out and look forward to driving it every day The Premium package includes air conditioning front center armrest speed control map lights tilt telescoping steering wheel P205 50R16 tires 16 inch 6 spoke aluminum wheels Id like to have been able to put my CDs inside the armrest And as I said I ordered the manual moonroof At first I was leaning away from it Part of me thought a manual moonroof would be cheap but it really isnt The armrest is nice but I have to say that they dont not_exactly not_give not_you not_a not_plethora not_of not_storage not_space not_inside not_A not_bit not_skimpy not_I not_think You can fully open it or crank it the other way and just use it to get some fresh air in the car without completely messing up your hair I dont not_like not_the not_cupholders not_and not_the not_changeholder The Zetec engine coupled with the stick shift gives tons of zip I find myself speeding frequently and having to slow down sometimes the car just gets away from me a little Breaking has not not_been not_an not_issue not_it not_stops not_just not_fine not_im not_not not_a not_gearhead not_so not_I not_cant not_get not_into not_specifics not_about not_engine not_performance not_and not_specifications My 2001 Ford Focus ZX3 just passed the 1500 mile mark and I love driving it I chose Twilight Blue w Medium Graphite interior Its a great combination I like how there is a patterned appearance in the center of the seats I also have the Power and Premium option packages as well as the manual moonroof im not not_a not_big not_fan not_of not_having not_to not_order not_a not_whole not_range not_of not_options not_in not_one not_big not_package but I think every car company does that now The Power package gives you Keyless entry which is great when you ve got an armful of groceries or packages you can just hit the blue trunk release and up goes the hatch Well it doesnt exactly go up but it does open enough for you to nudge it up into full open position Also included are power windows mirrors and locks They have side bolsters which give you the feeling of being held in place but not not_in not_an not_overly not_restrictive not_way not_I not_just not_feel not_secure not_and not_I not_like not_that not_Also not_with not_the not_manual not_seat not_height not_adjustment not_and not_the not_tilt not_telescopic not_steering not_wheel not_its not_easy not_for not_even not_a not_shorty not_like not_me not_to not_have not_a not_great not_view not_of not_the not_road not_and not_not not_have not_my not_chin not_touching not_the not_steering not_wheel not_My not_Dad not_sat not_in not_it not_hes not_got not_a not_Lincoln not_Towncar not_and not_is not_a not_big not_car not_kind not_of not_guy not_and not_he not_had not_plenty not_of not_room not_also not_My not_ZX3 not_is not_a not_5 not_speed not_which not_I not_would not_recommend not_because not_I not_think not_manual not_transmissions not_are not_just not_more not_fun not_to not_drive not_A not_bit not_of not_a not_pain not_to not_learn not_but not_once not_you not_dont not_you not_ll not_love not_it not_unless not_you not_frequently not_get not_stuck not_in not_long not_traffic then you may not not_love not_it not_quite not_as not_much not_as not_you not_continually not_shift not_from not_1st not_to not_2nd
Pos,The interior is wonderful The shift up indicator is a joke And that stereo just keeps pumping out exceptional sound It has far exceded my expectations for Ford cars As far as roominess goes I am very pleased But then when it comes to this stuff I am rather picky To begin I should say that this car was not not_my not_first not_choice So far none of my friends have volunteered to try this little feature out the chickens To make the back seats lie flat you have to pull knobs in the trunk It has loads of standard equipment such as A C CD player and remote keyless entry everything my Jetta had and more Where the shift console meets the carpet really bothers me It looks like someone just cut the plastic quickly with scissors And if someone manages to get locked in the trunk theres a glow in the dark handle which can be pulled to open it from the inside The one thing that I could have really used while learning to drive it is a tachometer I have no idea if I am over revving the thing and its a bit unnerving This thing is loud Good for knowing when to shift but takes away from the initial refined feel of the car Fortunately there is a really cool feature on the stereo that pumps the volume up to compensate for the engine noise If you re a speed demon you ll probably want to upgrade to the Zetec engine Its not not_expensive and it gives you 130hp which is 20 hp more than the SPI My only regret is that I didnt not_upgrade not_to not_that not_engine Not sure if I like that or not not_I guess its nice that anything in the trunk is secure im just used to doing it from inside the car I have to say I am very happy I bought this car so far It has also been a good replacement for the Jetta as it has most of the features the Jetta did plus a few extra I would recommend this car to anyone as disgusted with VW as I am young people just out of college or young families The car has pretty good pick up as far as I am concerned but keep in mind that before the Jetta I drove a 3 cylindar Subaru Justy for 7 years so im used to sluggish cars I think this car would keep up with my old Jetta but not not_on not_hills not_Especially not_mountain not_highways So smooth and

not_unbearable though it is disappointing that they have started this early in the cars life Trunk space is huge But not not_only did they offer me what I needed for my trade in they also had a program where they will add up to 4000 onto the purchase price of the vehicle and give it to you in a cheque so that you can go on a trip or pay credit cards or whatever you feel like doing with it Seeing as the Jetta ran up my credit cards significantly and this was the perfect opportunity to unload the thing I jumped on it and managed to bargain them down to close to invoice price ive only owned it since mid May but so far no regrets My Focus is a Fort Knox Gold SE with the standard 110hp 2 0 litre SPI engine and manual transmission My heart was set on a new Honda Civic I had test

have found it goes best if I shift at 10 15 kph higher than what the manual says and I still get over 500 kms on a tank of gas so not not_too not_shabby The Jetta had a bigger gas tank and I was lucky to get 400 kms out of it im still getting used to stop and go traffic so as I get better at that I suspect I ll get even better mileage in the city however I am doing much less highway driving than I was a month ago it accounted for about 20 of my kilometres now maybe 5 at best so I doubt I ll see much of a difference in my gas mileage Now to the engine performance handling
Pos,No skidding or slipping here The dash is very arty with its White Dials that are so common today It held up well in crash test and does come with both Driver and Passenger air bags Overall Oh my god what is that ugly thing Yet it seems to have spawned a whole host of ugly mobiles from various manufacturers The straight orderly lines of 80s cars had been replaced by uneven and ugly curves that appeared to have come straight off the concept board But it is all part of the rear of the car I liken it to the equally confused looking Nissan Almera for stragest boot in the world prize This is something Fords have lacked for sometime Handling Suprisingly good Traction control really helps out the wheelspin and ABS stops you when you ask It looks like it has had a rear end shunt and the lights have ended up somewhere at the top of the car I dont not_like not_this not_Interior not_Typical not_Ford not_plastic not_adorns not_the not_interior not_All not_Fords not_smell not_the not_same not_Plastic The Semi Stiff shocks give you a nice level ride but can be a bit severe on your bad back if you hit the bumps Still a nice drive on the motorway Acceleration After driving both the 1 6 and 1 8 models you can notice a pulling difference between these cars The stereo takes up most of the centre console and looks a nightmare if you want to install an after market unit Thankfully the people who supplied the stereo Visteon have done themselves proud by making a half decent effort at the sound system Ford were losing shed loads of money to its competition in Europe and still is So was the Focus really the market saviour Well no I dont not_think not_it not_was not_or not_is not_In not_the not_mid not_90s not_when not_it not_first not_hit not_the not_streets not_I not_just not_thought The 1 8 allows you to pull into the traffic when you want rather than wait for a gap big enough Its no neck breaker but ample for most people thats because it has its power supplied by one of the best engines in the market The Zetec Safety When the Focus was announced as the replacement to the popular Ford Escort I must admit I had my doubts After years of 1980s domination where nearly every drive in the country had a Sierra Escort or Fiesta on it Ford were struggling to keep up with the cheaper and more reliable Japanese models that flooded the market in the 1990s Id give this 7 out of 10 Handles good drives nice but a bit ugly Im afraid I dont not_think not_it not_was not_the not_saviour not_Ford not_wanted not_Information not_Visit not_the not_website not_to not_check not_it not_out not_further not_www not_ford not_co not_uk not_Fer not_are not_some not_stats not_for not_you not_1 not_8 not_Zetec not_0 not_60mph not_time not_8 not_8 not_seconds not_Power not_output not_125 not_hp not_6000 not_rpm not_Fuel not_Consumption not_41mpg not_on not_Motorway not_28 not_on not_Urban Ok it had been beaten to the medium size car market by the even uglier and more wierd Fiat Brava and Bravo but this was the first major player to make a statement Looks Looking at the car from the outside makes you think hang on from the front it looks just like a Fiesta Ka Well it does with its sloping pointy angry looking headlights and oval grille Moving back along the doors they seem to take up the majority of the side panels Its the rear of the car that really confuses me It is possibly the ugliest monstrosity to come out of the design house at Dunton Essex No Boot well it is a hatchback
Pos,But there is no such thing as a perfect car despite what anyone thinks The optional CD player takes up a lot of real estate on the dash and the controls are somewhat confusing The Focus that I rented was a SE 4 door sedan that was heavily optioned The ash try is placed right behind the steering wheel and is difficult to find in the day and down right impossible to find at night I recently rented one of the new Ford replacement for the Escort and lets just say that Ford is still making progress in their small car designs The funky interior and exterior design takes some getting used to and I guess that it would have to grow on you The interior now places the stereo system above the heat and a c controls as opposed to the opposite in the old Escort and that is a welcomed change as one generally will fiddle with the radio more than the climate control system The cup holders are down really low and difficult to reach I also dont not_like not_the not_self not_locking not_feature not_that not_causes not_the not_car not_to not_lock not_all not_the not_doors not_when not_one not_reaches not_about not_10 not_mph not_I not_am not_quite not_capable not_of not_locking not_the not_doors not_myself not_thank not_you not_very not_much not_I not_would not_have not_to not_put not_this not_vehicle not_high not_on not_the not_list not_though not_of not_the not_best not_of not_the not_breed not_in not_the not_small not_car not_world not_and not_considering not_that not_I not_have not_recently not_also not_driven not_a not_new not_Toyota not_Corrolla not_to not_me not_the not_Toyota not_is not_hard not_to not_justify not_for not_3000 not_more It did come equipped with the standard 2 0 liter engine that had been used in the Escort Having owned a 94 Escort wagon with a manual transmission and over 175 000 trouble free mind the Focus would be considered for a replacement Ford seems to have solved the noise and vibration problems that plagued the Escort The Focus idles silently and smoothly without the rear view mirror shake that I have become accustomed to in my personal car Although the engine now is rated at 110 horsepower the low end torque of the engine is such that it seems more powerful than it really is The seating position is higher than in the Escort and I found no real blind spots Around town the power with the optional automatic transmission is ideal for city conditions and is not not_bad not_on not_the not_highway not_either not_as not_I not_had not_cruised not_at not_85 not_mph not_and not_the not_vehicle not_tracked not_straight not_and not_true not_and not_was not_immune not_to not_cross not_winds not_Compared not_to not_the not_2001 not_Chevrolet not_that not_I not_had not_rented not_earlier not_in not_the not_year not_the not_Focus not_was not_actually not_superior not_on not_the not_highway not_and not_the not_seating not_position not_lets not_one not_get not_a not_better not_focus not_on not_the not_road not_ahead not_of not_you not_Handling not_and not_braking not_are not_very not_very not_good not_but not_gas not_mileage not_is not_lower not_than not_what not_the not_Escort not_could not_achieve not_but not_is not_still not_over not_30mpg not_on not_the not_highway
Pos,Not a bad deal for 600 Thats enormous for a hatchback The seats provide great support and room even with 5 adults in the car As you can tell it is a lot for the money There is no other car that offers this much at a reasonable price The other groups included power everything and such amenities as A C keyless entry tilt and telescoping steering wheel cruise control etc The 2002 SVT model will remedy this but is going to carry a more expensive price tag at 18 500 The driving experience is excellent I opted for the 5 speed manual transmission in my ZX3 although an 4 speed auto is optional This included everything that I wanted convenience group power group and S2 group which I greatly recommend for 600 It has a sporty yet sophisticated look to it The model I bought had a MSRP of 16420 The only thing that Ford could do to improve the car is have a more powerful engine offered Perhaps a 2 5 liter The rear hatch provides enough room for storage but with the split rear seats folded down the is a whoping 18 5 cubic feet of space I purchased a 2001 Ford Focus ZX3 S2 model not not_too not_long ago and I absolutely love it I couldnt ask for a better vehicle I previously owned a 1999 Mercury Cougar It was a great car until it started having problems I havent had a single problem with the ZX3 yet Ford really did a great job designing the Focus The S2 group includes premium 16 wheels and 50 series tires premium gauges S2 diamond pattern seats 6 disk in dash cd changer bucket seats rear spoiler chrome exhaust tip European tuned suspension and everything that the sports group offers The ride is exceptionally smooth for a small car due to its 4 wheel independent suspension Even when cruising in the highway at 70 mph the wind and road noise is minimal Inside the car the controls are nicely layed out and within perfect reach Headroom in the car is abundant even for someone over 6 tall
Pos,It looks great We wanted a new car We needed a new car We had mudguards put on as well The other doors unlock with two pushes of the unlock button We pay no interest over 5 years pretty good deal Heres the review Look We wanted a new wagon our 92 Taurus wagon was a loyal dog but a dog with fleas The sticker says it should get 25 mpg in the city and 34 on the highway This is a nice comfort for those late nights in a strange parking lot What it could use The rear trunk pops up with the push of a button from the inside panel Automatic windows and locks respond very nicely Also there should be dome or reading lights available to the backseat passengers my kids miss theirs from the Taurus wagon My guess is thats about right with moderate driving work supermarket etc we go thru a fillup once a week Little things It really turns heads and people cant not_believe not_its not_a not_Ford and when you test drive it neither will you If it didnt not_have not_the not_blue not_Ford not_oval not_on not_the not_front not_and not_rear not_you not_wouldnt not_know not_it not_was not_a not_domestic not_let not_alone not_a not_Ford It could use lit vanity mirrors for the driver and passenger Ford put a lot of neat things in this car and this should ve been one of them The inside is a masterpiece Great curves great lines Comfort Unlike the old Escort models even the ZX2 you dont not_feel not_like not_you not_are not_sitting not_on not_the not_pavement not_while not_in not_the not_car Two kids in car seats in the back havent complained yet and they used to be traveling in the Taurus wagon with that huge bench seat Plenty of leg room up front too Gas It stunk like it was on its last leg We shopped did internet research and the all important test drives and came up with the Ford Focus Wagon And what a deal plus we got Ford Credits 0 Financing deal What carmakers called European handling in the 80s is here in this domestic car The SE Wagon comes standard with the nice Zetec engine and has great pick up Whats more the car doesnt rattle or feel like its going to fall apart when doing 70 mph on the highway It could also use those magazine pocket things on the back of the front seats so the kids can put their books and things in them they miss them too Finally Buy it you ll like it We got ours in White with the Tan interior looks very sharp You ll be speeding along at 75 and feel like you re going 35 Trust me on this point its incredible Room Ford says it has more room in the inside than any other car in its class I havent really investigated this but I am a believer anyways It has stiff handling which is a surprise from a Ford You can haul a lot of stuff in this Wagon we havent suffered by moving down a class to midsize from the Taurus wagon Inside dome lights have that fade out thing when you get out and shut the doors nice A nice security measure is this when using the remote clicker only driver side door opens with one push of the unlock button What great seats like sitting in your living room I dont not_get not_numb not_butt not_when not_driving not_for not_over not_an not_hour not_like not_from not_other not_cars Drivers seat has adjustable height as well I like mine the whole way up Function Everything is right in front of you If you ever claim you hit that car or ran that light because you were fooling with the radio or AC the claims adjuster will know you are lying because you re driving a Focus Cup holders on the floor in the middle are great Standard AC and CD player are cool AC blows cool and powerful Heat comes up quickly for those brisk winter days Handling Rounding curves or making 90 degree turns couldnt be more comfortable
Pos,We own a hatchback The trunk space is not not_overly not_large but it is adequate I just wouldnt not_take not_it not_on not_a not_long not_trip not_with not_all not_the not_kids not_stuff The focus seems much more stable has better pick up and hopefully will not not_be not_as not_much not_trouble not_as not_the not_Echo not_has not_been The gas mileage is great Average mileage is 35 per gallon I would suggest this car to anyone looking for a new vehicle The interior is very comfortable and the air conditioner is very cold Even sitting in the back seat between two car seats I stayed very cool The Ford Focus caught my eye but not not_my not_pocketbook for over a year I believed that they were little boxes and felt as if I would be better off buying something different Boy was I wrong I have a 2000 Toyota ECHO and have recently purchased a 2001 Focus
Pos,What sold me on the car was the test drive The car holds corners extremely well and the highway ride is that of a big luxury car One drawback is that the doors are long and heavy and therefore difficult for small people to manage The model is out of production now Ford is planning to reintroduce the Thunderbird as a sports car The car now has 186 000 miles on it and I have replaced only one major part the head gasket Their own weight caused them to sag and I had to have them repaired but it was not not_terribly not_expensive There have been about three call backs but none of them were of concern to me and I have not not_had not_the not_work not_done That was a costly 1000 repair but a faulty head gasket can be manufactured by any company its just bad luck Aside from that all other engine and drive train parts are original and functioning well I own a 1993 Ford Thunderbird LX Automatic V 6 It has been the most reliable car I have ever owned more reliable than any of several foreign cars including a Saab The visibility is good in all directions I have had no trouble on wet roads and the snow handling has been satisfactory I paid about 15 500 for the car in 1993 so the cost of about 2200 per year or 8 cents a mile has been very reasonable All in all I would recommend this as a good used car if it has been well maintained
Pos,Oh well life has its compromises The back seats were not not_particularly not_comfortable not_either The driving handling quality is excellent and for the features the price is good too The fit and finish for this American made vehicle is quite good The Ride is excellent The icing on the cake was Ford sponsored 3 9 financing PLUS a 500 rebate OK I have owned pickup trucks and I have owned a pure SUV and for me each is a compromise It had adequate room for hauling stuff like groceries but not not_practical not_for not_hauling not_dirty not_stuff not_like not_building not_materials not_or not_plants One negative I have to back it into my garage to close the door as it is almost two feet longer than an Expedition The idea of putting a human being in some of those jump seats they put in those things is laughable even for children It is hardly a practical vehicle for me unless you only expect to put children in the back seats Finally last year I saw the Ford SuperCrew and said to myself There is a truck car or was it a car truck I like Essentially it seems like an Expedition with a 5 foot truck bed instead of the space for a third row of seats In considering this purchase I had to struggle with the question is a vehicle that has BOTH attributes nothing but a compromise at best My 1996 Nissan Pathfinder was handy In fact the rear seat room in the SuperCab is only 2 inches smaller than the Expedition I drove the SuperCrew and thats all it took I purchased the Lariat upgraded package because I like leather seats and the paint trim was good looking The sticker price on this wonderful vehicle was actually 2 000 less than my venerable 96 Nissan Pathfinder and while it doesnt have 4 wheel drive that I hardly ever used with the Nissan it does have EVERYTHING else including almost twice the horsepower and the same gas consumption and MORE Then came the first few four door pickups Owning a Nissan I stopped by and looked at a Nissan truck with four real doors I attempted to sit in the back seat of one and found that for me the only way I could get in was to physically crawl in on all fours and then sit sideways It was a bit anemic in the power category but OK I missed my pickup but I need a vehicle that has a real back seat and in a way the Pathfinder was a compromise that I could live with Still I occasionally hauled things in the Nissan like bags of cement and bulky things from Home Depot that should never have been attempted with what is essentially a station wagon I looked at King Cab pickups but saw them as just pickups with wasted space for junk behind the drivers seat It came with the 5 4 engine which was listed at 800 extra on the base model I drive primarily in an urban area and own a boat that this truck pulls without effort I expected horrible fuel mileage but so far I am surprised to find that in city driving it is virtually identical in gas consumption to the Pathfinder I traded in I realize that if loaded down this will change drastically however the good thing is at least with this truck I have the option of loading it down While it is absolutely true that this truck is not not_a not_panacea not_for not_EVERYONE not_so not_far not_it not_really not_is not_for not_me not_I not_can not_put not_five not_adults not_COMFORTABLEY not_in not_it not_I not_can not_pull not_a not_boat not_or not_trailer not_effortlessly not_I not_can not_haul not_ten not_bags not_of not_cement not_or not_dog not_food not_or not_throw not_my not_golf not_clubs not_in not_the not_back not_and not_not not_worry not_about not_snagging not_the not_upholstery not_of not_an not_SUV not_I not_can not_use not_the not_bed not_extender not_and not_haul not_larger not_items and I can pick up my family at the airport and not not_worry not_about not_my not_wifes not_self not_esteem not_being not_bruised not_by not_riding not_in not_a not_pickup
Pos,The trailer pulling seems to affect the wear on the u joints Also about 200 bales of hay a month and 2 tons of grain These trucks are not not_for not_city not_people not_even not_though not_they not_are not_really not_comfortable not_for not_city not_and not_long not_distance not_driving The truck has been used very heavily pulling four horse trailer loaded about 11 000 pounds on a Class IV hitch weekly for about 5 years The dealer was supposed to take the truck down to bare metal and re prime and paint it As well all rust was to be repaired It has been run back and forth from Halifax to Toronto sometimes with horses sometimes without since 1989 and has never yet failed me on the road But they re just great for us country folk and while I will never buy another Ford car I definitely will buy another Ford truck im real happy with this one It has cost us a lot less on repairs than anything we have owned in years Its consistent Its fixable Fords service manuals are very good which helps The four wheel drive version might keep on going through the snow and icy roads but wait until you try to stop the 4 wheel drive truck once you get them going The most common repair on it outside of body repairs and regular wear out and maintenance has been U joints and since I have sold my trailer I am now getting about five years on the U joints instead of 12 18 months I bought this truck new in 1988 and its still going strong today I expect to get at least 15 years use out of this truck with relatively minor repairs and if I get that then I will be pushing it to get 20 years They re a amp to park in the city parking lots and on the streets they re hard on gas in the city and if you have the full size box and whats the point on getting anything but and extended cab they just dont not_fit not_in not_the not_garage not_of not_most not_city not_homes not_coming not_in not_at not_about not_twenty not_feet not_long It hauls a real heavy load we installed a set of Timbren hollow rubber springs tow truck kit and are still running on the original springs if you can believe it no re arching and no broken leaves I have been hauling up to one tonne in the box grain with no problems by using these Timbren hollow rubber springs Looks and handles like there is no load in the truck The dealer did a really poor job in fact I think Ford paid for a lot of work that the dealer billed them for but didnt not_do not_which not_has not_been not_my not_experience not_with not_our not_local not_Ford not_dealers not_in not_the not_Halifax not_Dartmouth not_area not_of not_Nova not_Scotia Only one repair held up more than twenty four months and that was a panel that they had to cut out and a new one welded in We ve worked this truck real hard Most parts that have been replaced on the truck have been due failure dut to rust not not_wear not_out not_or not_failed not_parts not_Electrical not_can not_be not_a not_big not_problem not_on not_these not_trucks not_the not_big not_gang not_connector not_on not_the not_wiring not_harness caused about three months worth of grief in 1995 the plug was cut out and all the wires were hard wired together siliconed and there have been no problems since Body has been a problem with the truck perforation and paint Ford re painted the truck at their expense a recall If you buy a used one and its rust proofed you should get years more on it Even if its not not_rust proofed at least it is entirely fixable right down to the frame I had frame repairs done last year perforation right through the rail Ford body parts are becoming a problem to obtain but after market parts are still readily available I probably wont buy another new one cant not_come not_up not_with not_this not_kind not_of not_cash not_again not_for not_a not_vehicle but it will be somebodys well used truck It has over 300 000 km on it I continue to drive it almost daily about 75 100 km per day for work Gas consumption is still about 18 mpg CDN on the highway same as the day it was new and less in the city Fuel economy is a little less than the GM and Dodge trucks are getting but the repairs according to friends with these trucks are fewer Fuel economy pulling a trailer is AWFUL with this 5 0 litre eight cylinder you need the diesel for any kind of economy but its totally reliable and never breaks down and hauls loads that are twice what the truck is rated for A friend and I do the exactly same thing with our trucks my Ford and her GM and the Ford wins out hands down every time and it takes about a fifty percent heavier payload than her GM will Its a typical truck lousy in the snow and on icy roads you need about 500 lbs of ballast over the back axle on bad roads
Pos,I cant not_believe not_out not_test not_drive not_of not_the not_new not_2001 not_Ford not_Super not_Crew not_F not_150 The ride was smooth as glass and plenty of pep for the highway The exterior color I really was drawn to was the new Island Blue The towing package also comes with a larger radiator for more efficient cooling while towing It has the size and power of a full size work horse but one look inside will convince you this is No ordinary truck Also the roomy back seat could easily seat three adults and the back seats fold 40 60 to allow for lots of extra storage The stylish features include a two tone dash extra plush seating fashionable grab bars well appointed easy to read dash steering wheel controls matching head rests a handy center console plus drink containers and pockets in the door panels for extra storage It was easy to handle in traffic and visibility was excellent as well My husband a GMC man is built like a bear and he had too agree this truck has a lot to offer The bed is 5 5 but there is an optional bar extension that will give you 7 of hauling space for 195 00 Great appeal for both the luxury details for the ladies and brute strength for the guys Plus room for teenagers in the back seats I recommend it for a terrific family vehicle
Pos,We are a family of 5 and totally enjoy this truck If you can get one with a moon roof do it It is a fun option The gas mileage is better than I thought it would be My truck is black and requires lots of baths but there is nothing that compares with a shiny new black truck I bought my Ford F150 Lariet Supercrew 4x4 about a month ago I havent found anything that I dont not_like not_about not_it I love the way it handles much better that the explorer that I traded in The interior is wonderful the leather is very durable I can seat 6 people the backseat is very roomy even with three kids in it The bed extender is handy ive hauled a full size mattress and box springs and the power is awesome
Pos,You have plenty of room through out the truck If you like big vehicles and the ride of a car buy this truck My truck has a AM FM CD Player with surround sound automatic with cruise power windows and door locks I did not not_purchase not_the not_extended not_gate not_that not_is not_a not_option not_on not_this not_vehicle We purchased our 2001 F 150 SuperCrew on April 15th 2000 as soon as they hit the market I could not not_ask not_for not_a not_better not_truck Has all the space of a car with towing and hauling of a truck The V 8 engine is more than able to pull my 14 ft cargo trailor A great looking truck I will purchase another one as soon as my time is up with this one Ford has hit the jackpot with this one in my book
Pos,This truck is pretty fast too The cassette player wont release my tape This also was covered by warranty The fuel pump had to be replaced In fact I prefer driving it to my 2000 BMW We have 3 children and the interior is roomy enough to please The dual media is a nice option and the factory radio sound quality is great We ve owned 2 Ford trucks prior to this one so we were quite familiar with them This truck rides well in fact its the one we choose to drive long distances We purchased our SuperCrew in Feb 2001 Ours is a 4x4 Lariat 5 4 liter with navy blue on tan leather interior Here are some problems we ve encountered with this truck 1 As previously stated this is our 3rd Ford truck There are no blind spots and it handles well plus theres no need to cringe when you hit a pothole You dont not_have not_to not_fret not_about not_changing not_lanes not_on not_the not_highway not_in not_this not_im not_5 not_ft not_4in and have no trouble whatsoever driving this truck We thought maybe the tape was defective but it turns out the CD player wont work either Our Ford dealer has ordered us another radio which is covered by warranty 3 My husband is a general contractor and realtor so hauling equipment and or building supplies as well as people were both equally important I think we ve found the best of both worlds with this truck On all 3 we ve always had to have the up down window button on the passenger side only replaced For some reason they re always defunct Do something about this Ford covered by warranty 2
Pos,The steering has great feel This car is on a rail My wife purchased this car new in 1995 We drove both an SE and a GT for comparison We have replaced a battery spark plug wires and tires The Goodyear Eagles were done at about 35 000 miles The paint seems to be of a lower quality than most cars This is not not_a not_family not_car but that is part of the fun In spite of regular washing and waxing this car is showing a few flaws It has about 50 000 miles and has been pretty much trouble free the last few years Or a teenager that wants to make it into a SCCA solo racer It handles superbly so much so I wish it had 20 or 30 more horsepower The GT is a totally different car Fast and sprung stiffly it is a real sports car Our car is not not_loaded not_no not_sunroof not_or not_leather but has air cruise CD player power locks remote keyless entry and a few other goodies She wanted a laser red 5 speed GT and we were able to find one at a local Ford dealer Nothing terrible but I worry about it Lastly the V 6 is starting to burn a small amount of oil about a quart every 3 000 miles We replaced them with Parnelli Jones all seasons which work very well I now drive this car daily and it is simply a joy to drive The car has a large trunk and the seats fold down to offer tons of space for hauling larger items Finally what a sweet looking car Wish I had something this cool back in high school The ride is quite stiff I mean STIFF Everyone that rides in this car comments on it You do adjust driving it daily but it is just not very comfortable for any long trips The stick shift is fantastic with quick shifts and smooth operation I am 6 3 so I do have to squeeze myself into this car but I can get comfortable no one can sit behind me though On the down side the rear seats are not not_usuable not_for not_kids not_if not_you not_are not_tall not_like not_me not_I not_have not_a not_car not_seat not_on not_the not_passanger not_side not_and not_have not_to not_move not_the not_passanger not_front not_seat not_up not_quite not_a not_bit not_in not_order not_for not_the not_seat not_to not_fit not_No not_way not_we not_can not_get not_a not_2nd not_child not_behind not_me not_so not_this not_cars not_days not_are not_numbered It still runs perfect 22 mpg in the city and 26 mpg on the highway I plan to trade or sell this car soon and re sale looks pretty bad Oh well it was fun while we had it This is a great car for a single guy or girl or a couple with no kids Once we had the car we did run into several problems all of which were minor A leaky radiator cap pealing paint on the hood broken seat air pump for the bolster I think maybe a few others I forgot about All were corrected under warrenty I worried about the paint the most but they seemed to be able to fix this and it has not not_been not_a not_problem

Pos,The column mounted gear shifter however was placed in an awkward position The materials used in the interior could also be improved The large windows and upright seating position also allows for good visibility The Escape is Fords entry in the popular mini SUV class of automobiles The main detraction from the driving experience relates to the immense amount of noise that emanates from the road and the engine The Escapes steering is very linear and direct and the SUV benefits from having a short wheelbase I was able to maneuver the Escape in busy Seattle highway traffic with ease The V6 engine with 201 hp provides a lot of power and torque for a car of this size and I was able to accelerate easily in all situations It does not not_shift not_very not_well and it obscures a portion of the radio A better solution would be to place the shifter in between the front passengers like most other SUVs It doesnt try to be too adventurous or too athletic like the XTerra with its spoilers and front grills and yet doesnt look to docile like the CRV Not surprisingly the Escape looks a lot like an Explorer albeit one with updated and refreshed lines It competes with the Nissan Xterra Honda CRV Toyota RAV4 and a few other SUVs I think Ford has a good thing on its hands and with a few minor changes the Escape could be a category leader Exterior the Escape is the best looking car in its class The dashboard and doors use cheap looking plastic and the seats are covered by a rough fabric Driving the Escapes strongest selling point is its drivability The Escape simply drives as well as any good car which means that it drives better than most SUVs One element that can be improved on the exterior of the Escape is the side view mirrors which shake at highway speeds due to the wind and dont not_provide not_a not_good not_view not_of not_other not_cars not_Interior not_the not_interior not_of not_the not_Escape not_is not_generally not_well not_thought not_out not_The not_radio not_and not_climate not_control not_controls not_are not_easy not_to not_use not_and not_located not_high not_up not_on not_the not_middle not_console The car is so loud on some roads that I had to turn the radio up Ford should consider fitting the Escape with different tires and more sound deadening material for a quieter ride Overall the Escape is a reasonably priced small SUV that drives more like a car than a truck and seems built from one solid piece If Ford improves the quality of the interior including a redesign of the shifter and makes the Escape quieter this SUV will set sales records

Pos,The ride was a little stiffer but not not_as not_bad as we expected It has been through several snow storms this winter here in CT and has performed admirably We purchased our Escape in Oct 2000 and have had one recall notice that did not not_apply not_to not_our not_vehicle We ve been averaging 16 17 miles per gallon around town and 20 21 mpg on the highway We were hoping for a little better gas mileage but for an SUV I guess the mileage we re getting isnt not_all not_that not_bad The most important factor in our decision to buy this vehicle was that my wife felt completely safe driving it After a snowy winter she still feels the same The front seats took some time getting used to but after a few trips we realized that they offer good support and back fatigue after 2 3 hours of driving has not not_been not_a not_factor It feels very stable at both highway speed and in bad weather im sure the 4 wheel independent suspension has a lot to do with this The automatic 4 wheel drive works amazingly well One has to try hard to get a wheel to spin on wet as well as snowy roads My wife and I were in the market for a SUV and test driving the mini SUVs Honda CRV Hyundai Sante Fe Subaru Forester to name a few of the vehicles we tested After the first mile driving the 2001 Escape XLT my wifes mind was made up She was impressed with the visibility power and interior room She was giving up her 95 Mitsubishi Diamante for a 4 wheel drive vehicle
Pos,Bottom Line The ride The car rides very smoothly The look I purchased a light parchment gold Escape with the leather interior The Escape rides lower than larger SUVs and I wouldnt not_trust not_it not_in not_a not_true not_off not_roading not_situation The wind noise is pretty bad This is about the only negative thing I have to say about the car Bells and Whistles However when you jump on the highway be prepared to turn the radio up and or talk very loudly with your passengers The gear shifter is somewhat awkwardly placed and gets in the way of the radio I have the V6 model and the fuel economy is decent while still providing plenty of giddyup You can also get a four cylinder model for increased fuel efficiency but I have my doubts as to whether that will lend enough power to adequately drive the car For serious off roaders this probably is not not_your not_best not_option The truck looks great inside and out People are always admiring it asking about it and I definitely recommend going with leather if you can afford it It is comfortable sharp and will help hold up the resale value While I have a more Spartan model you can trick out your Escape with moonroof and deluxe sound system including a six CD changer I have the standard single CD system and am very happy with it Shifting into four wheel drive is a snap and the cruise and wiper controls are of the standard simple to use variety I have had my Escape for six months and love it The Great A lot of car for the price roomy interior decent gas mileage people crane their necks on the road to check it out The Not So Great Lots of wind noise on the highway probably not ideal for true off roading may cause accidents from other drivers admiring it I first purchased my Ford Escape last October when I was staring straight into the beginning of another harsh winter and a daily two hour round trip commute I needed a vehicle with four wheel drive and did not not_want not_to not_have not_to not_resort not_to not_selling not_off not_body not_parts not_to not_pay not_for not_gas not_Heres not_some not_specifics
Pos,The rear seats are easy to maneuver once you get the hang Its very long even though I still find myself grabbing the windshield wiper instead It cleans only a small semi circle you can see out it but for me I wanted more window cleaned The fact that it takes runs on regular gas is simply a joy Call me silly but with the power and performance of that power you would expect premium gas hands down Inside is roomy On the streets its chomping at the bit to go but you cant not_so not_it not_seems not_like not_it not_makes not_you not_pay not_for not_not not_putting not_it not_on not_the not_highway not_A not_simple not_thing not_but not_the not_rear not_window not_wiper not_is not_a not_bit not_of not_wimp The dash is easy to read and everything is at your fingertips Plenty of storage big and small Convenience cargo cover and net are a nice touch an additional 12v outlet in the rear Access to the rear can be done via opening the rear door or opening the glass window and reaching in I dislike the shifter on the steering column The first and probably the most impressive thing to grab and get your attention is the power this baby has V6 you say to yourself over and over as you fly down the road With that said and in spite of its power its handling is just as impressive Turning on a dime with a SUV can you believe it yes you can At night you cant not_see not_the not_shifter not_so not_when not_you not_reach not_for not_the not_radio not_cassette not_CD not_controls not_you not_can not_as not_I not_have not_hit not_the not_shifter not_which not_scares not_the not_living not_daylights not_out not_of not_you not_I not_have not_since not_put not_a not_white not_wrap not_around not_it not_so not_I not_cant not_miss not_it not_Because not_of not_its not_power not_and not_its not_power not_and not_power not_you not_do not_really not_move not_Because not_of not_this not_you not_find not_yourself not_in not_the not_station not_often not_I not_think not_it not_has not_a not_mind not_of not_its not_own not_on not_the not_highway not_mileage not_is not_great Granted this is my first SUV so I didnt not_know not_what not_to not_expect not_I not_did not_my not_homework not_with not_all not_the not_SUVs not_out not_there not_and not_knew not_I not_wanted not_a not_4X4 not_automatic not_with not_a not_few not_nice not_things not_in not_it not_and not_a not_few not_of not_the not_standard not_things not_I not_did not_a not_lot not_of not_comparisons not_of not_different not_SUVs not_using not_Consumer not_Reports not_Car not_Service and I always found that the ESCAPE was at the top of the list Needless to say they were scarce to say the least I was online everyday looking for one I struck gold one on a Tuesday made the deal on Saturday I have a soup to nuts XLT with the only thing missing being the side air bags
Pos,The competition The bad news This was great And not not_to not_mention not_bad not_roads As far as being environmentally friendly All kids learn to hate this ride By the way really kills gas mileage too So another environmentally friendly plus for the big truck The fit and finish is much better then the original The long rides to Florida down the dreaded route 95 corridor The Excursion 3 feet of snow and no issues This forced the dealers to clear out the 2003 stock It really did blow the monthly payment out of the window It may be a stretch but none the less true It is smoother and quitter then the 2000 The tri door makes access to the rear cargo area simple So I waited for the 2004 Excursions to roll off the assembly line We could actually fit all the stuff for vacation without the roof carrier The interior is comfortable enough without being one of those sissy SUV 146s This was driven daily by my wife to and from school with the kids We definitely notice a better ride in the 2003 then the original 2000 All the features a mom of three could want Life in the Minivan The Chevy and GMC were over 10 k more and the incentives were not not_as not_good The V10 was great in the first one so we had no reservations about another V10 Three kids later and we still have the lab In 2000 we leased our first Excursion V10 Limited All I was missing was my remote and I would have been right at home Oh yea that would take 33 3 trips And you still have room for 3 more in the third row Access is better then the GM trucks It gave us the right amount of room and comfort that we needed at that time Fast forward The move A year and a half into the Windstar we decided that we really needed the larger vehicle The fact that you do not not_loose not_the not_rear not_wiper not_as not_you not_would not_on not_the not_GM not_Barn not_door not_style not_is not_a not_plus Try a romp around NYC and see how quick a lesser truck would crumble the torture of the urban roads The shocks are not not_as not_harsh and it does not not_bounce not_around not_as not_much not_as not_the not_2000 not_did not_Bad not_Roads Try 1000 pounds of cement in the back of your echo The long wheel base gives the Excursion the ride of a Limo A 4x4 Limo Because of the length it floats down the road We also looked at the Suburban and the Yukon XL Best kept secret we got allot more truck for allot less money So what you may say Well by car pooling we kept one additional vehicle off the already crowded roads and actually saved resources Oil every 3 000 miles tire rotation after every 12 000 miles and that is it not not_a not_problem and never not_back for any warranty work Consolidation is being environmentally friendly If you can 146t run with the big boys go to the back of the bus Pun intended This is a great vehicle if you have children alot of stuff need to move and tow large and heavy things In the beginning When we bought or first SUV 1994 Jeep Grand Cherokee it worked just fine for us it was just us and our big yellow labrador And by the way even in your best dream the Odyssey doesn 146t come close to the interior space of an Excursion If you ever danced fender to fender with a Yellow Cab you certainly understand why in the city size does matter maintenance After 24 months and 36 000 miles And for the first time it really did work in my favor 0 financing 4 000 off from Ford Smack the dealer around a little more and they will drop another 2 000 off Which leads me to believe that the 6 146 tall guy who borrowed his bosses truck is a REALLY BAD DRIVER But that is my work vehicle that I drive over 25 000 miles per year Just as the insight fits my needs during the week the excursion fits my wifes needs If ford made a Hybrid Excursion that got 70 MPG I 146d buy it But they don 146t and the excursion suits our lifestyle today My thoughts Great truck Great Value We live in the NY Tri State area and during one of the family outing to the Bronx Zoo we invited another family to come with us We all fit in the Excursion We had our pick of styles colors and options Sales may be down but it sure did give me allot of vehicles to choose from We purchased a beautiful black 2003 Limited Excursion The roads in the State of New Jersey kills more cars then bad drivers Statistically this may not not_be not_true but have you ever hit a large pot hole followed by a series of whoop de doos They are powerful enough to propel a 32 foot motor home they can certainly handle the excursion Although I would have liked the 6 0 Diesel the 4 000 uplift was a bit much to handle In response to the couple making the penis jokes guess what I DON 146T HAVE A PENIS because I am a mother of three Maybe it is you who has the penis envy The sound system is fantastic and the kids love the fact that the windows went all the way down Even with Baby seats all have enough room to spread out A full size cooler fits in the center just behind the front seats making the outer seats usable for passengers Not right for everyone but if you have any of the above needs this vehicle is for you People who don 146t have children and never owned an Excursion should not not_write not_about not_it not_Very not_well not_written not_review not_for not_a not_single not_person not_who not_drives not_a not_little not_toyota And one last thing the suv 146s that park too close or take

146s acts like a bus We used it like a bus She is only 5 4 at best and had no problem driving this truck Not a nick on a bumper in two years Bottom line it did a great job hauling two strollers three kids a dog and who ever else needed to go some where Great for Vacations too It was actually a pleasure to have enough room to be comfortable all the way down without killing each other And the fact that it does have a 44 gallon gas tank is a god send on very long trips Especially when going through states that don 146t have stations every two miles or when driving through the night when most stations are closed Inside Who is being environmentally friendly now Would love to see what you say about the Porsche 911 ps a note from the wife I am the primary driver of this truck and I love it I just wanted to respond to the negative comments written I am only 5 4 and I have never once had a visibility issue or a maneuverability issue We did a few long road trips to Indiana and florida with the Windstar it drove great but buy were we a little tight For the extra space that was needed the roof carrier came out of mothballs again Albeit the gas mileage was better in the mini van but the need for space was greater Snow and Bad weather Even with optional traction control it was not not_the not_best not_in not_the not_snow not_Maybe not_we not_just not_got not_used not_to not_the

luck would have it the buy back was very high and they wanted almost 30 000 to buy it back Being that it was out of warranty at this point we decided that a nice shiny new 2002 Ford Windstar Limited was the way to go It too had all the bells and whistles for family use Video auto sliding doors remote start and the tow package Not something you want to attempt in a non SUV I 146ve seen these roads tear off wheels Again creating large traffic jams during rush hour Another mass waste of fossil fuel and commuters time ok that was another stretch but you get the point City Roads New York City will kill a vehicle just as quickly as a off road Baja race People say 147 People who buy SUV 146s never take them off road 148 you do not not_have not_to not_take not_it not_off not_road not_to not_have

ratings and you decide I 146ve had well over 8000 pounds on the back and boy did it drive like nothing was behind me Enough said about that This is a great towing truck Ride
Pos,This is going to be a wonderful starter vehicle for my son when he turn sixteen next year If you are looking to do heavy hauling this is not not_recommended though it should do fine with the 6 cylinder version The Ford Ranger is sharp looking truck and provides a comfortable ride I t has been great for getting back and forth to work and has been very reliable However if you want to pass someone the four cylinder engine does not not_provide not_enough not_power not_to not_do not_it not_without not_downshifting and I would always hesitate before trying to pass on an up hill slope Overall the paint seems to be holding up very well as are the factory alloy wheels Braking and handling provide no major complaints
Pos,The sweet spot was the 1992 1995 second generation cars There were three generations of the SHO The front brakes are another consistent source of trouble In 1986 they had bet the company on the groundbreaking Taurus One note The SHO was simply spicier and more engaging than the Germans All four areas should be checked out before buying a SHO It is just a destructive as pouring metal shavings in the intake In the late 80s Ford tried to beat the Germans at their own game That was the challenge that faced the Taurus SHO throughout its eleven year production run The first 1989 1991 was the original 86 Jellybean Taurus platform with the SHO V 6 and suspension component upgrades In America these cars have been icons of intelligence and success for more than a generation If the thermostat sticks open the engine wont overheat but something just as bad can happen All fuel injected engines use the engine temperature as one of the major factors to determine the air fuel mixture The final version 1996 1999 used the all new Oval Taurus platform and carried an equally new V 8 But I dont not_recommend not_either The automatic didnt not_make not_the not_SHO not_a not_bestseller but it did improve the feel of driving the car But it was still notably less precise than the action on the rear wheel drive BMW with its superb five speed But neither in my book compared to the shot of tequila and a big slap on the back feeling of the SHO Their answer was a dual overhead cam 24 valve V 6 that only shared a three liter displacement with the engine in lesser Taurus models And a good automatic is better partnered to this style of driving In the SHO it was no contest in my book Like most of their motorcycle engines the SHO does not not_have not_hydraulic not_valve not_adjustors not_so not_the not_clearance not_has not_to not_be not_set not_by not_a not_mechanic The Mercedes from its engine to how the ashtray door closed with a solid but velvet smooth action felt literally like a bank vault on wheels This made the Taurus SHO the quickest car in its class More important than the numbers was how different the three cars felt in action It wasnt not_crude not_in not_capable not_hands not_the not_SHO not_was not_a not_remarkably not_composed not_car not_to not_drive not_at not_speed not_with not_little not_body not_roll not_and not_crisp not_responses In their homeland they are more likely to be diesel powered taxis designed for durability and low operating cost than ultimate driving machines bred for the autobahn The BMW reeked of refinement by drivers extremely capable yet never feeling like it would lose its composure Both were outstanding cars with clear personalities The brake and clutch problems can be cured with the right application of high performance parts and the engine subframe is a job that should be good for several years One problem area that isnt not_unique not_to not_the not_SHO but needs to be mentioned is the importance of keeping the thermostat and catalytic converters in good condition The second generation cars were slightly better but Ford simply put rotors on the car that were too small to stand up to the punishment of a high performance sports sedan The discovery of the enthusiast and aftermarket support on the web for the SHO has been another pleasant surprise This is an indispensable resource for SHO owners Americans travelling in Europe for the first time often have a moment of culture shock when they hail a taxi and a Mercedes E class or BMW 5 series pulls up to the curb The first generation SHO was a great engine mated to a chassis that wasnt not_intended not_for not_it not_while not_the not_third not_became not_so not_refined not_it not_lost not_much not_of not_the not_distinctive not_personality not_in not_the not_earlier not_versions The automatic was a better automatic than the manual was manual Huh While the manual was improved in 92 it still had an imprecision that hindered finding a gear instinctively The SHO like any vehicle with an all aluminium engine should have the coolant system flushed and replaced every year Other problems fall into the nitpick category The good news is the owner groups have developed inexpensive solutions for all the interior problems if you have a little mechanical ability with one exception There are regional SHO owner clubs across America and a strong aftermarket for replacement and high performance parts Note to gearheads When you got into the gas in the Ford the engine growled the steering wheel tugged slightly in your hands then the growl became a roar as the tachometer needle swung quickly towards 7 000 rpm All in all not not_a not_bad not_list of major problem areas for a high performance car And by contrast the second generation base Taurus models have earned a lemon reputation for blowing head gaskets in their 3 8 liter engines and eating their AXOD E transaxles The engine was a marvel With 220 horsepower available the SHO was the most powerful engine in its class by a slim marging But it weighed 400 pounds less than the Merc and 500 pounds less than the BMW The level of aftermarket support for the V 6 SHO is as good as you ll find for a Camaro or Mustang The SHO models shared no engine parts with the base models and used specially modified transmissions that have proven very durable Can anyone think of another high performance engine transmission that is more reliable than the base model But if you want to repair it plan on laying out about 300 for a new power mechanism Pricing and Owner Support In the last year ive seen close to a dozen very clean 92 95 SHOs with prices in the 7 000 range But unlike a bike its not not_a not_regular not_occurrence Ford specifies a major service between 60 000 and 100 000 miles that includes a valve adjustment and replacing the engine timing belt spark plug wires and control arm bushings It couldnt compete against the European sedans sold here But Ford wondered if the Germans could remake a taxi into a world class sport sedan could they do it with a car that had won the hearts of conservative middle America When you do this the airflow through the engine reverses momentarily and because the cats on the SHO are mounted close to the engine if there is any debris in the cat it can be sucked back into the engine The thinking was as only a relative few BMWs came to America with manual gearboxes and Mercedes didnt not_offer not_them not_on not_any not_model not_in not_the not_E not_class not_to not_compete not_the not_SHO not_needed not_an not_automatic not_even not_if not_the not_purists not_had not_a not_fit not_over not_it not_The not_critics not_were not_half not_right The Yamaha engine has proven to be as tough as granite Aside from possible valve guide wear in hard driven cars there havent been any major problems with the engine at all Look for a little blue smoke at a cold startup hard starting or oil consumption greater than a quart every 700 miles Like when it was new that is almost exactly half the Blue Book for a 530i or E 320 But in my area that would buy you an immaculate car It was one of the most easily overlooked cars when it was new and today it has become a hidden treasure for enthusiasts And if a Bimmer owner scoffs as they are wont to do just ask how he likes his taxi Brian Igo i At extremely affordable prices for this class too Along with continued parts support from Ford the SHO is one of the rare limited edition models that hasnt become an orphan in retirement But it does remain one of the best values in the entire automotive market The Kelly Blue Book quotes a 10 200 retail price for a 95 SHO automatic with 75 000 miles in my area As an entertaining and unique sport sedan to be appreciated for what Ford created or as the platform for a midlife crisis the SHO is impossible to beat If you werent there it is almost impossible to imagine the impact this car had on the American auto industry Its styling was as cutting edge as any European sedan of the time and it had much more of a European feel than any American sedan made before It was by any objective standard a worthy competitor to the midsize entries from BMW and Mercedes one with a distinctive American accent But in the end not not_enough buyers could make the mental leap that this Taurus was different than the one their parents had traded in their Fairmont or Caprice Classic for Overview and Driving Impressions The heart of the SHO was its engine Yamaha was originally hired to design a new cylinder head for the 3 0 liter Ford V 6 The head they came up with produced too much power for the Ford block to live with so Ford contracted them to come up with an entire powerplant It is a major bill but nothing compared to the expense of failure if something like the timing belt lets go and this service on the SHO will cost a fraction of the same service expenses on a BMW or Mercedes as the miles reach this territory The source for everything you ever wanted to know about the SHO and one of the best auto fan sites ive seen on the web is SHOtimes com This is just my personal preference but in a midsized or larger sedan I prefer an automatic if it is done right Hustling a small light sports car up a road and snapping through shifts is one of lifes greater joys but a 3 000 pound sedan is more enjoyable when the strategy is smoothness and forethought If you notice the driver seat rocks when you sit down or move the only fix is replacing the power mechanism a bracket with the adjustor motors and trays that move the seat Its not not_a not_safety not_hazard the seat is still firmly attached to the floor In looking through the newsgroup boards I was pleasantly surprised to see that most of the problems owners are reporting after five years are the same ones I saw when the cars were still under warranty most involving interior trim parts All of the DIY cheap fixes I mentioned in passing are there along with an excellent reference on troubleshooting literally dozens of different conditions and great how to instructions for maintenance This may be hazardous to your wealth but SHOShop com is a wonderful and highly recommended source for replacement and aftermarket SHO parts Excellent stuff at reasonable prices and the best designed website ive seen for a speedshop i br br One of the big reasons to choose a second generation car over a first is the shifter mechanism for the five speed transaxle First gen SHOs used a cable actuated shifter that had all the feel of stirring a pot of warm molasses Starting in 92 all five speed SHOs ditched the spaghetti wires for solid linkage that greatly improved the feel All front wheel drive cars share this handicap compared to a good rear wheel drive setup Torque steer another bane of powerful front wheel drive cars could tug the wheel in your hands but you really had to be hamfisted with the throttle to have it effect your driving As I mentioned earlier in 1993 the SHO got the slushbox automatic the critics said the market wanted The rotors get too hot and warp when used hard and like most cars made in the last decade Ford only included enough metal on the them to have them machined and trued once Maybe if you were lucky and caught it soon enough Finally for all the initial concern about funneling 200 lb ft of torque through a front wheel drive transaxle the only weak link has been the clutch in the manual transmission models Is my relief confusing While the lumbar support leaking and the wiper control on the turn signal stalk failing too soon is evidence that there were some areas where Ford missed the mark in design and manufacture after five to seven years I expected to see new problems emerging as the cars piled up the miles and that hasnt been the case In 1992 all Taurii were redesigned and the SHO received distinctive front and rear styling that gave it a crisper stronger look than the first edition Under the skin several weaknesses and customer complaints had been addressed and the entire platform was strengthened giving the SHO handling abilities that came closer to matching the Germans than any American sedan that came before And in 1993 it finally got the automatic transmission the pundits said it needed to win over American buyers If the engine is running too cold as it will when the thermostat is stuck open the mixture will be too rich But instead of this unburned fuel vapor pouring out the tailpipe and creating smog it is ignited and burned in the cat Which gets much hotter than it was designed to be and begins to break apart inside Its not not_a not_problem until you lift off the gas from a higher engine speed like when getting off the freeway The E 320 and 530i weighed in at almost twice that fifty large in the same trim Its the greatest price disparity between similar cars that ive ever seen Reliability And Maintenance Against all bets when it was in production the second generation SHO has proven itself a remarkably durable car Only three big dollar problem areas have been uncovered on the second generation cars SHOs driven in the snowbelt during winter have been known to develop corrosion in the engine subframe Its not not_a not_fatal not_problem the subframe can be replaced for a few hundred dollars including labor The automatic was better mated to the SHO with crisp smooth upshifts that matched the sporting personality of the car and the effect of torque steer was greatly reduced compared to the manual Unless you are the kind of enthusiast who cant not_have not_any not_sports not_car not_with not_an not_automatic not_the not_auto not_is not_a not_better not_way not_to not_go not_If not_the not_Taurus not_was not_a not_bargain not_BMW not_as

not_less not_than not_25 not_000 And because most SHO buyers werent testosterone poisoned young adults read Camaro Mustang market the chances of finding a well maintained and cared for car are very good Conclusion A SHO has been on my list of cars to have since I worked on them at Earnhardt Ford Its a terrific sports sedan at an econobox price that has held up remarkably well and the Mad Scientist in me still gets an evil grin when I think about the things I wanted to do with it And that was when I only imagine stripping all the power amenities and losing a quick 60 70 pounds just on the interior Now I can get superchargers that make up to 400 horsepower i Bottom line
Pos,The ride is great both front and back seats You can easily sleep in the back seat on road trips If they would fix the road noise it could be almost perfect The weatherstripping on the windows seems to make a lot of noise There is plenty of room for the family up front and the luggage in the trunk The acceleration is also very good for a family car as you can make passes safely Common repairs are average in cost brakes tires oil changes If you play the radio at average volume you dont not_seem not_to not_hear not_it but when the radio isnt not_on not_it seems kind of loud I have owned my Taurus for 3 years and I put about 60 000 miles on it in those 3 years I have been very happy with the car in all aspects except road noise But I have priced some other parts that seemed a little high rotors 100 alternator 200 these seem about double what the average part might cost Fortunately I havent had to replace these parts but it is something to keep in mind when buying this type of car Overall the 1995 Taurus is a great family with pretty much everything I have expected from this car
Pos,This is one top performing automobile They ve slowed it down six miles an hour When design unites with quality performance then that is one unique drive The GL is obviously of better quality than the plain one Both automobiles were are top performers The power and performances of this type of automobile along with its durability and low maintenance is tops When I decided to sell I purchased a 1995 Taurus GL to take its place I purchased a 1989 Ford Taurus a few years back and was impressed with the ride and comfort coupled with its gas mileage I was a little disappointed with the power thus decided to make that a priority with my next automobile This automobile can certainly take what is dished out Excellent quality and exquisite ride make this a most desireable car I prefer the body style and unique design of the 95 model over todays version I prefer the unique designs that set apart from the obvious The sport design catches the attention of the youth in all of us yet the roominess and comfort interests the adult in us And the quality and durability satisfies all The Ford Taurus has been first on the race track until Nascar made them slow it down where the other cars could keep up
Pos,When I first heard my husband say Ford Taurus I said No way thats a granny car And at 27 I didnt not_want not_a not_granny not_car not_Well not_I not_decided not_to not_look not_at not_and not_drive not_the not_95 not_model not_and not_fell not_in not_love It has all the nice features of a more expensive car power windows and door locks tilt cruise keyless entry etc but it was actually affordable I have been driving this car for 1 1 1 years now and plan on driving the wheels off And this from a person that had traded vehicles every year for the past 4 years I had a truck sports car and a mini van but will stick with the Ford Taurus from now on will probably buy a new one when this one goes out The only problem I have is the doors automatically lock if the car is running but with the keyless entry that is not not_really not_a not_big not_deal not_i not_would not_recommend not_to not_any not_family not_looking not_for not_a not_good not_car not_for not_their not_money
Pos,The Taurus is an excellent family car with plenty of room inside and in the trunk The air conditioning and heating provide excellent climate control and the stock stereo is good for everyday listening There isnt not_a not_lot not_of not_leg not_room not_in not_the not_back not_seat not_for not_passengers not_with not_long not_legs We traded in our Saturn sedan for a Ford Taurus because we needed more space for our baby So far we have had no major engine or system trouble and we ve had the Taurus for 2 years The brakes ignition switch has come unconnected twice since we ve had the car and has had to be pushed back in by hand
Pos,When i found out the facts about the Taurus i was pretty impressive The safety on the car was excellent a lot lower to insure than other cars it drove real good and had lots of peep The ford Taurus is a great car for young or old i didnt not_want not_to not_by not_it not_by not_name but when i sat in it and test drove it it was quick for me to change my opinion There wasnt not_to not_much not_i not_didnt not_like not_about not_the not_car not_it not_at not_more not_gas not_than not_my not_old not_four not_cylinder not_engine not_but not_not not_much and it sure out powered it This is a great overall car with class and is a car four just about anyone
Pos,The transmission is an electronic 4 speed automatic overdrive Full Review Ford Taurus SEL 2002 NoBull The Ford Taurus SEL It had a 4 wheel discs anti lock system The interior of the car I drove had a very beautiful and stylish color combination Ford but if you are thinking of 8 adults you will be stuffed in like sardines The exterior of 2002 Taurus Wagon has very beautiful lines and all its components are very proportionate to each others The newly design cabin will give occupants an added two inches in rear seat headroom and a full inch in front seat headroom The color of the car I test drove was an eye catching Harvest Gold protected with a Metallic Clearcoat The front seats are very comfortable even more on the driver side which is equipped with a six way power drivers seat adjustment including a very good and appreciated manual lumbar adjustment The 2002 Taurus Wagon is a real pleasure to drive either within city limits or on the high roads I had the opportunity to drive it on an extended trip on one of upstate New York most scenic highway One things I liked is how high the rear gate opens to allow you to load the cargo this will definitely helps preventing people from banging their head on the rear gate Once you open up the fold down rear seats you have no more room for cargo I did feel that for a station wagon even with that rear seat down you had very little space for luggage and equipment The seats and door panels were creme with medium dark grey dashboard and trims and the carpet was a light brown the color scheme really looked smart and was very pleasing to the eyes The Taurus Wagon can sit 8 passengers so claims The sitting capacity is for 8 passengers and the cargo volume is 82 cubic feet Driving the Ford Taurus SEL Wagon was a real charm I went for a drive on some of the most scenic roads in North America and what a sight with the Fall foliage turning from green to red brown and gold and this beautiful gold automobile simply faded in with the natural decor The ride was excellent and the scenery was breathtaking I really appreciated how well the Taurus wagon hugged the road and how comfortable you are it this car The Taurus SEL Wagon comes equipped with 4 wheel disc brakes anti lock system and a new Electronic Brake Distribution system mounted on a Power adjustable brake and accelerator kit which makes it easy to find the proper way to adjust the pedals and seat to the drivers choice N The Taurus SEL Wagon I drove was equipped with a V6 DOHC 24 valve 3 liters Wagon 2002 is an example that a car manufacturer can put out a vehicle that will surpass government recommended safety standards and still be a very attractive and stylish automobile Ever since a coworker bought a Taurus Wagon and rode in it I always have been very impressed by this car I thought that not not_only it looked very nice on the exterior but also that the interior was very practical stylish and comfortable Ford has equipped the 2002 Taurus with a series of safety features that makes it one of the safest cars on the road Some of the safety features includes dual stage front air bags crash severity sensor safety belt pre tensioners safety belt energy management retractors safety belt usage sensors and driver seat position sensor With all those innovative safety features it is no wonder that the US government has giving the Ford Taurus a Five Star Crash Test Rating the highest mark a car can receive for crash test safety testing
Pos,Though some door panels are of lower quality the price point compensates greatly for the shortcomings We continue to be impressed by its road manners comfort ambience and thoughtfully laid out interior It is chockfull with options everything from ABS Traction Control to illuminated visors electronic climate control 24 valve 3 0 L Duratec engine to leather seating and illuminated perimeter lighting systems to name a few Weve had our 2002 Ford Taurus SEL for about 3 months and have driven it about 3500 miles with no unscheduled maintenance Our Taurus cost us 23 400 without rebates and tax licensing fees applied A similiarly equipped 2002 Camry would have set us back atleast 28 000 minus the rebates of which there arnt many Overall brakes good could be a tad better transmission Excellent value excellent and the overall identity of the Taurus is excellent Wed definitely recommend a Taurus particularly because of the outstanding customer service weve received at the Ford Customer Relationship Center 1 800 241 3673 and because of the overall quality performance and comfort of this vehicle
Pos,We recently took our family of 5 on a road trip for 6 weeks We plugged in an electric cooler into one of the power ports and the laptop computer into another power port The kids didnt not_fight not_because not_they not_each not_had not_their not_own not_seat not_and not_no not_one not_had not_to not_touch not_anyone not_else They watched movies played educational games on the laptop played the regular games that Nintendo has to offer slept when they wanted to etc I was in the market for a new van and I checked out all the mini vans that are out there I also began to look at the full size vans I found that I could purchase a brand new Ford E 150 Van Conversion for about the same amount as the mini van The features in the mini van didnt not_even not_compare not_to not_the not_amenities not_that not_were not_available not_in not_the not_van not_conversion not_I not_got not_leather not_seats not_4 not_captain not_chairs not_and not_a not_bench not_seat not_in not_the not_back not_that not_lowers not_with not_the not_push not_of not_a not_button not_into not_a not_full not_size not_bed not_I not_also not_have not_a not_tv not_vcr not_game not_port not_to not_plug not_in not_the not_nintendo not_and not_several not_power not_ports This is the ultimate family travel vehicle I also drive the van as my everyday vehicle and love it I am bigger than most cars on the road and taller so I see things further ahead of me I feel safer and the little extra that I spend on gasoline to run a larger van is well worth the cost If you are considering a van conversion for your family I highly recommend the Ford E 150
Pos,It does not not_have not_the not_best not_gas not_milege not_which not_is not_hard not_with not_these not_high not_gas not_prices The interior stayed nice even with 11 kids on board most of the time We have an 89 Ford econoline van for personal use and have had 3 Club wagons over the past few years for transporting our 8 foster children We went ahead and replaced it since it is the only problem we have ever had from the van The only major problem we had was that the brakes did not not_last not_as not_long not_as not_they not_really not_should not_have We have had a 90 92 94 clubwagons that took a beating and kept on going We averaged 50 000 miles a year Our 89 is like a tank it is kind of ugly too but that thing just keeps on ticking We had to replace the transmission recently at a cost of approx 1000 But it does have 2 tanks which helps sot hat you do not not_have not_to not_constantly not_stop not_for not_gas Also the shades in the windows have rotted I wish they had been made with a better quality fabric
Pos,The first repair was for the back window wiper My other rant concerns the stability of the Explorer This is not not_the not_case not_for not_most not_car not_buyers The consumer pays the sales tax on the new car The 2000 Explorer XLT has anti lock brakes and dual front seat airbags The vehicle comes equipped with a remote keyless entry system and an anti theft system At first it worked but sporadically and eventually quit working at all The 2000 Explorer has a CD player in the dash as well as cassette and an AM FM radio The dealership however would have to pay sales tax on the used trade in I assume If the buyer trades in a car the purchase price is lowered accordingly and the buyer pays sales tax on that price The ignition key has a chip inside it so that the vehicle cannot not_be not_started not_except not_with not_the not_ignition not_key not_or not_by not_a not_really not_good not_professional not_car not_thief If you know why dealerships low ball the trade in values please satisfy my curiosity and leave a comment Overall I highly recommend the 2000 Ford Explorer XLT The 2000 model I purchased gets slightly worse gas mileage than the 1994 Sport I owned The 1994 Explorer had a standard transmission and was about a foot smaller without the additional passenger doors If the road conditions are hazardous due to snow or rain driving an SUV does not not_give not_one not_license not_to not_continue not_to not_drive not_at not_70 not_mph not_when not_everyone not_else not_is not_going not_45mph The windows have a lock feature controlled by the driver which has come in handy During our drive from Virginia to New York we allowed the cats out of their crates The second time I took the Explorer in because the ABS light came on when I started the vehicle and stayed on indicating that the anti lock brake system had disabled itself because of a problem The high speeds in bad weather conditions not not_only endangers oneself and ones passengers it also endangers the other drivers on the road who have more respect for the necessity of slowing down in bad weather The motor was burned out and replaced I noticed that I had to ensure that the wiper is properly positioned after opening and closing the cargo window which can be opened independently of the cargo door Of course the dealership low balled the trade in value of my Explorer but I bargained them down to the price range I wanted 18 19 000 I have a theory about why dealerships low ball trade ins My gas mileage hovers around 15mpg in town and 19mpg on the highway Since I have less of a commute my fuel costs have gone down significantly rather than up However this is not not_a not_fuel not_efficient not_vehicle not_Features not_i not_Safety not_Features But the repairs were free so I

the window closes im fairly sure that the wiper was trapped and various rental car drivers would turn on the rear wiper and just leave it on burning out the motor even when the wiper wasnt not_working While driving an SUV statistically protects you more in accidents I see SUV drivers all the time flouting the road conditions and driving like maniacs Newsflash people an SUV will protect one more in an accident but isnt not_it not_better not_to not_not not_be not_in not_an not_accident not_in not_the not_first not_place In the process I drove a Nissan Pathfinder a Nissan Exterra a Ford Escape a Ford 4 door XLT Explorer a Mazda Liberty a Mercury Mountaineer all new and various used models including a 2000 Ford Explorer Since neither of us wanted to shell out 30 000 for a new SUV a used vehicle was more within our budget At the oil change no other repairs or maintenance were needed other than the oil was a quart low when I brought it in I am slightly annoyed that I had to bring the vehicle into the dealership for service at all since I did not not_once not_use not_the not_warranty not_on not_my not_first not_Explorer In all of my test driving experiments I found that I liked best the handling and turning radius of my 1994 Explorer and the other Explorers I test drove and decided that I would be happiest with another Explorer and narrowed my search accordingly On April 2 I purchased a white 2000 Ford 4 door XLT Explorer My assumption was correct and the service department made the necessary adjustments to the brakes that had caused the ABS to disable itself Like the 1994 Explorer the 2000 Explorer has all the owner operator parts marked in yellow the oil dipstick the battery the various liquid wells ive had the oil changed once since purchase and its due again The standard items are very convenient and easy to use the vehicle is easy to maintain I have plenty of cargo room for moving 600 800 pounds of my things or even waiving furniture delivery fees and transporting pieces of furniture home myself I love this Explorer almost as much as I loved my first one The vehicle does have a higher center of gravity than a car or some of the smaller SUVs Driving an SUV requires some adjustments one often has to take curves more slowly so that the vehicle wont tip over The Explorer is very stable if one drives it keeping in mind the higher center of gravity The remote keyless entry system unlocks the drivers side door with one touch With two touches it unlocks the rest of the vehicles I like this feature because I can control unlocking the doors independent of each other by only unlocking the drivers door I can jump in and lock that door quickly possibly preventing an assailant from getting into the car through another door Last spring I needed to trade in my rear wheel drive 1994 Explorer Sport for a four wheel drive or front wheel drive vehicle since I was in the process of moving to a cold weather climate If Id moved to a warmer climate or remained in Virginia I would not not_have not_parted not_with not_my not_Explorer not_because not_it not_was not_such not_a not_great not_vehicle not_and not_had not_been not_easy not_to not_maintain not_and not_it not_was not_paid not_off This particular vehicle had been a rental car auctioned off after a year still under the manufacturers warranty and had nearly 24 000 miles on it In the seven months ive owned the vehicle ive put another 10 000 miles on it with moving from Virginia to New England going back for our wedding and various trips between my duty station and my husbands on the weekends as well as regular day to day use Gas Mileage The drivers side door also has a keypad so that if I lock the keys in the car I can punch in the code to open the drivers door only and retrieve the keys ive found this feature very useful when I want to go running I lock the house keys in the car run and unlock the car using the keypad so im not not_carrying not_keys not_with not_me not_or not_losing not_them not_while not_I not_exercise The vehicle came equipped with cruise control air conditioning rear air conditioning which my cats and other passengers appreciate two visors each for the driver and front passenger seats spare tire mounted underneath lots of cargo space about a foot more than the Explorer Sport six way adjustable drivers seat with

not_the not_manufacturers not_warranty not_on not_this not_vehicle not_is not_good not_until not_December not_2002 My husband and I decided that I should look at SUVs exclusively because having one in the family allows us to do partial do it yourself moves for which the government will pay us for the amount of household goods we move ourselves rather than the commercial moving company contracted to move the bulk of our things its like getting a bonus for bringing along the luggage and essentials that we d take with us anyway Also my husband was very insistent that I continue to drive an SUV for safety reasons I began test driving SUVs and looking around for potential replacements
Pos,We have loved our SUV ever since My husband amp I recently bought a Ford Explorer after much research amp study We had many times driven or been in my father in laws Ford Expedition This is a very important feature if you live in a hilly or snow prone areas We decided on a Sports Utility amp then had to decide which one This was out of our price range but we liked what it had to offer We decided against the Honda Passport for this very reason The Ford Explorer 2 wheel drive does have front wheel drive However its still comparatively lower than the insurance cost for other SUVs Overall the Ford Explorer is the best buy in its class The Ford Explorer is the biggest SUV in its class Its considered to be in the small sports utility class We found that the Ford Explorer had many of those same options that we like so much in the Expedition in our price range One of the things that we noticed when searching for a sports utility was that some of the 2 wheel drive SUVs have rear wheel instead of front wheel drive If you live in California though it may not not_be not_that not_important not_to not_you not_The not_higher not_insurance not_we not_now not_have not_because not_we not_re not_driving not_a not_sports not_utility isnt not_a not_great not_feature
Pos,There are several auxilery powerpoints for numerous electronics It comes with standard AC and heat both in the front and back seats The car has great handling for an SUV due to its smaller size This another benefit of the Sport over other SUV behemoths on the road today This car is available in manual or for just an extra thousand dollars automatic The four wheel drive is easy to use and results in very little loss of control It is loaded to the gills with features with the top of the line models still costing less than 30 000 So if you are looking into a 4x4 for a new driver or buying your first I would definitely recommend the Explorer Sport There is an extra power door lock by the back gate so that you can lock the doors after taking stuff out of the back On the inside various packages can get you a high end MACH Audio system with a six disc CD changer Even without this the second level stereo still has AM FM cassette deck and a single CD player In a time when SUVs are getting bigger and bigger Excursion Suburban etc the Ford Explorer Sport stands out as a quality vehicle not not_only relative to size but also overall This car is a great winter vehicle but if you want to go skiing in it you may run into problems trying to store longer skis in the back However the car is short enough that one can easily access a ski rack on the roof This is a great winter car especially for a young driver which is the type of person that I would strongly recommend this car for It handles well in tough conditions which is very helpful plus it is not not_too not_large and it is very affordable It packs a huge V 6 standard or an optional V 8 under its tiny hood Because of a shorter wheelbase all this power is very easy to control Even with the two door design there is still room for two passengers to sit comfortably in the back seat which can be folded down to accommodate skis or other large packages
Pos,The power windows are well powerful It has been very reliable car Summary This is a great vehicle for all our needs and uses The four wheel Anti Lock Braking System ABS is installed also It is easy to operate and sounds nice There have been no major mechanical or drive train failures so far Grievances The one negative part of the vehicle on my list is the interior Its very convenient and a great idea from the folks at Ford It would be nice to adjust where the A C blows We bought our first Explorer a 1991 we were admittedly naive in the SUV buying field As part of the vehicle that we purchased we have the towing option In addition to dual front impact airbags side curtain airbags are included for the front passengers Our family camps frequently so the extra space offered by SUVs is a must have The airbags are actually stored in the outside of the front seats on the sides facing the doors To sweep the windshield only once the wipers must actually be turned on then quickly turned off We ended up leasing a 2000 Explorer XLS with a V6 automatic transmission and lots of nice features Convenience Features It is very comfortable for long trips and fits us perfectly Overall we are very happy with the car In addition to standard power locks there is another lock unlock switch located just inside the opening rear window NICE FEATURE This is a nice safety feature so you dont not_go not_skidding not_out not_of not_control not_by not_slamming not_the not_brakes not_Repair not_Record not_So not_Far Also the interior door handles seem to be cheap the frame around the handle on the drivers door has gone crooked Why i they asked would you put yourselves through this when you just fixed the last one i This allows you to lock the vehicle after retrieving one last thing from the cargo storage area without opening one of the front doors The stereo is quite nice a CD cassette combo unit with six nice LARGE preset buttons to eliminate a lot of groping and fumbling while watching the road The tilt steering wheel is also equipped I have nothing remarkable to say about this it tilts the steering wheel Not too technical here This vehicle has needed only a few very minor repairs since we took delivery nearly 18 000 miles ago An oil pressure sensor was replaced and a seat belt assembly factory recall This I imagine adds extra wear and tear to the control versus

bars without causing any sort of damage We are planning on purchasing it at the end of the lease period and look forward to many more years of enjoyment for leisure business and hauling around the kids All windows with the exception of windshield and front seat windows are tinted nice and dark not not_quite limo tint but enough to make anyone in the rear comfortable in a late afternoon driving session There were simply too many good features on Explorers that we loved to NOT own one plus we knew from talking to mechanic friends that the engineering and quality had improved in later models Also the driver has a Window Lock switch to prevent any of the other passengers from playing with the windows nice for kid safety bad for a spouse that has angered the driver Privacy glass is a nice option The tint is good quality has not not_scratched not_or not_faded not_at not_all not_Running not_boards came with our vehicle although not not_necessary for us they are nice for older people who join us the boards are usable by both front and rear seat passengers On side impact these airbags will be there to shield you from the side window or from the side windows shattering into your face Fortunately we have never had any accidents in the vehicle so I cant not_tell not_you not_how not_well not_the not_airbags not_work The air conditioning works wonderfully and is very cold when you want it to be One complaint however is that the output for A C is NOT adjustable it will only be forced out the vents blowing directly on your face The heater works just as well and in bone chilling Michigan winters it heats up quickly without having to start the engine five minutes before leaving the house Cruise control works remarkably well maintaining your chosen speed regardless of weather or incline situations you might be experiencing It is of course easy to operate incorporating the standard buttons which are snuggled up to the airbag area on both sides of the wheel Standard delay feature on the windshield wipers applies although im somewhat disappointed to see that a mist feature has not not_been not_added The control is located on the other side of the stereo it needs to be located closer to the other controls because it is quite a reach when you re trying to concentrate on driving in weather in which the rear wiper is needed The rear window is equipped with a wiper that has a two or three delay settings plus it squirts windshield washer fluid Two complaints here 1 After a while the wiper only now cleans a portion of the area it once used to it leaves a large gap toward the top of the window 2 The rear doors of the vehicle now each contain a suction cup once attached to childrens window shades swallowed up after I had rolled down the window forgetting the shades were installed Drivers window automatically rolls down with extra pressure on the switch but rolling it up requires holding down the switch through completion We have the fog lamp option which is really nice when driving at night because it illuminates the side of the road very well without disturbing other drivers Especially nice in our area because deer making a go at crossing the road at midnight are much more easily seen than without these lights Safety Features This means that there is a wiring kit provided to hook up to a trailer when you want to tow it To be honest we have not

for the best deal read cheapest SUV for sale Unfortunately the dealership we dealt with was not not_the not_most not_reputable and hid some of the problems temporarily until the warranty exchange period had expired Subsequently we drove an Explorer with bad lifters anyone whos ever been in that situation can tell you how embarrassing it was to drive around in a car that clicked loudly causing people to make comments to us about oil changes and vehicle maintenance and eventually had the engine rebuilt After this experience and the bellyaching our family and friends heard for over three years everyone was surprised when we traded it in for a new 2000 model Why not not_get not_a not_mini not_van not_i not_you not_might not_ask not_Living not_in not_Michigan not_with not_a not_difficult not_to not_plow not_driveway and the winter precipitation plus camping in rural areas only accessible via very rough two track areas we ve learned that an SUV is an excellent choice for our situation Its not not_just about the looks although we do like the sleek design but just as much about function Also I play keyboards and will frequently haul a large load of equipment so secure sheltered space is definitely a NEED for us ive owned a pickup in the past and prefer an SUV for this purpose Plus we can have more passengers along with the equipment Knowing what we liked in an SUV we shopped around the SUV market and eventually decided on another Explorer for many different reason
Pos,It is roomy We bought the Explorer XLS four door The ride is smooth and it handles very well It is everything our friends had said about it and more You ride very high and it gives you a great view of the road The 23 000 price tag includes a c stereo w cd running boards luggage rack and luxury wheels That was the 23rd of December Today I have owned an Explorer for 2 weeks and I can tell you that I am nothing but pleased This xmas my wife took me to the ford dealer to see a vehicle A lot of our friends own and drive Ford Explorers and we have heard many good things about it but to tell the truth I wasnt not_too not_thrilled The gas mileage is very good especially for a vehicle this size and the engine has lots of pep Up to now all I can find that is not not_to not_my not_liking not_is not_that not_it not_idles not_a not_wee not_bit not_rough not_for not_a not_new not_car not_I not_test not_drove not_others not_and not_they not_all not_did not_the not_same not_Overall not_I not_feel not_that not_we not_got not_a not_lot not_of not_value not_for not_our not_money not_and not_would not_surely not_recommend not_that not_anyone not_thinking not_about not_buying not_a not_new not_car not_take not_a not_serious not_look not_at not_the not_Ford not_Explorer
Pos,It is definitely an awesome buy This car really hasnt had any problems and its reliable You feel safe when you re behind the wheel But the minor problems were both fixed by the Ford Company because of the 36 000 mile warranty The Ford Explorer was one of the best investments i have ever made Also my car has been hit four times when it was parked somewhere The company is fair and honest and they really know how to treat a customer That stuff that people say about a car flipping over isnt not_true not_with not_this not_SUV The car rides smooth and is great for long trips with lots of cargo space ive owned this vehicle for 2 months and have had slight problems It has survived all four instances without even receiving a scratch I may just be lucky but i would say that the car is built to protect the driver I would recommend this vehicle to anyone who loves to drive because it is great for road trips or just cruisin around town
Pos,If I get a good response I will start work on the site over the holidays My idea is to have a free membership where people can enroll and submit the latest news information and developments regarding their vehicle e mail me if your interested at kevincwgordon yahoo com im considering starting an on line ford explorer club do you think there is interest I see many such clubs on the web for Mustangs Camaros Eclipses etc There seems to be as many Explorers out there as anything so I think there could be a need for this I will be contacting Ford to get their support and approval
Pos,The acceleration is very good at the bottom end while not not_so impressive at the top end Currently own Dark Wedgewood Eddie Bauer Edition 4 x 4 I am impressed with the fit and finish of the interior and the convenience items Most impressive is the note recorder and garage door opener on the sunvisor what a surprise and delight when I discovered this feature Very useful The automatic 4 wheel drive feature is also very useful it just switches to 4 wheel drive when you need it The vehicle is very stable and comfortable at higher speeds unlike previous year models I have owned While the styling is a little long in the tooth I still like the current design looks very sporty and strong I personally like the size just right I had an Expedition before and found it to be a little big I would recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a very good looking stable and roomy SUV

Pos,What can I say other than WOW If you are a person who just absolutely loves sport utility vehicles then this is the one for you This really is one of the greatest vehicles on the market today The Ford Explorer has great handling and rides very smoothly The only downside that this vehicle has is that it eats gas but then again what SUV doesnt I would also recommend the Expedition and the Explorer Sport as highly efficient vehicles The inner portion of the Explorer has more than plenty of room to allow you to drive with the utmost comfort I would definately recommend this vehicle to anyone The Ford Explorer is a highly reliable SUV sport utility vehicle
Pos,One bit of advice for SUV wannabees My likes are many and dislikes are nil So my experience with supposedly easy to tip over SUVs runs deep So if you keep vehicles longterm like I do skip the moonroof and eliminate the rainstorm possibility We were definitely up a goat track more than 1 5 miles to the river bank where we set up camp The imports all inferior way over priced copies of GMC and Chrysler products Buy American Buy Ford Explorer Rocks Detroit Jons Howell Michigan just north of Hell MI And thankfully so far I have not not_had not_any not_of not_the not_feared not_rollovers not_I not_purchased not_this not_Gem not_in not_12 not_00 not_for not_22 not_K not_a not_steal not_in not_my not_opinion But they arent Jeeps anymore since they are technically a Chrysler product Durangos just plain cheap feel GM blazer jimmy bravada whatever all the same tinny under powered rattling pieces of Detroit junk some history I have always been a Ford boy Had an 84 BroncoII still have a 86 BroncoII Stills runs great with 200 K showing and is my current hunting wagon And when it snows I smile knowing that this beast eats snow for a living One thing my BroncoII has over the Explorer is its capability off road In the winter the Ford heating system is fast and strong in summer the A C is just as fast and strong Road feel and comfort in the Explorer are vastly improved over my 86 BroncoII as well as power and towing capability In the near term it looks as tho the brake pads will need to be replaced 45 50 K miles not not_bad at all and I may even upgrade shocks and toss in a tweaked computer chip to upgrade the standing start performance The only option I think not not_on not_this not_gem is the power moonroof and to be honest I dont not_miss not_it not_I not_had not_one not_on not_the not_BroncoII and after a few years it began to have a persistent leak in rainstorms So far after 45 000 miles I have had no repairs of any kind no rattles no wind noises nothing but joy and bliss I do ALL my own maintenance and I made sure to get the complete shop manual 2 book set tossed in when i purchased it from Ford The 86 had manual 5 speed with manual locking hubs and shorter wheelbase and was lighter as well With its 2 9 V6 the BroncoII could run circles around the explorer on a muddy goat track However in the Explorers defense I did recently travel with two gals on board with all the camping equipment and luggage etc to the Boardman river in the Per Marquette National Forest in Northern Lower Michigan And let me tell you this Transport Tank Explorer did not not_even not_flinch not_Surefooted not_and not_comfortable not_all not_the not_way not_with not_10 not_disc not_cd not_changer not_to not_boot not_How not_civilized not_a not_way not_to not_off not_road not_Way not_to not_go not_Ford not_technical not_My not_4 not_0 not_SOHC not_v not_6 not_delivers not_and not_average not_21 not_MPG not_fairly not_consistently not_I not_live not_on not_a not_dirt not_road not_in not_Howell not_MI not_and not_travel not_roughly not_2 not_3 not_of not_the not_time not_on not_highway Now the details Mine is the 4door E Bauer with all the gizmos Leather data display digital memo overhead console rear sound system rear a c control keyless entry alarm puddle lites xenon lighting 16 FIRESTONEs yes I trust em still but I am on the list for replacement with Michelin Crossterrain just getting some mileage out of the Firestones first almost 46 K so far on them also have the roof rack and trailer package and electric everything Dont buy this vehicle or any other SUV if you are prone to radical highway driving or are prone to being distracted by chatting on cell phones with lovers or using such fine vehicles as a dressing room while driving and especially if you prefer to drink while driving dont buy a fine vehicle like this If you do buy it keep both hands on wheel and treat it with the respect which it deserves As noted by many the explorer has adequate power for passing its off the line performance is a bit dull but hey its a truck whattaya want Other than that I change the oil more frequently than the 10 K interval and I check the tranny fluid levels almost whenever I check oil Also I stay away from automated car washes preferring to powerwash myself and I frequently do clean cars dont not_rust not_proof not_is not_my not_86 not_broncoII not_I not_look not_forward not_to not_reporting not_back not_when not_this not_stallion not_hits not_100 not_000 not_miles not_if not_you not_want not_a not_recommendation not_Jeep not_grand not_wagoneers not_have not_cramped not_foot not_space not_on not_both not_left not_and not_right not_front not_cowls not_they not_have not_more not_road not_noise not_and not_just not_dont not_compare not_on not_interior not_or not_exterior not_appointments
Pos,It is completely smooth better than a car The radio ahh it has a CD and a tape deck If so this is the vehicle for all your adventures We like Dodge products but their prices are much higher than Ford The look of the Explorer was also an attraction next to the price This Explorer has power everything seats windows etc It is so nice to carry our golf clubs in a nice reachable vehicle versus a deep dark trunk or a dirty pick up truck You would think this vehicle wouldnt not_corner not_well but oh my you would be so surprised I dont not_even not_feel not_it not_going not_around not_a not_corner The roomy Explorer has seats that fold down and a cover for the back behind the seat so people dont not_have not_to not_see not_what not_you not_are not_hauling not_around We can take people and stuff anywhere and not not_ruin not_the not_comfortable not_exploring not_we not_do not_If not_you not_are not_looking not_for not_a not_roomy not_comfortable not_get not_around not_vehicle not_this not_is not_a not_good not_choice The radio was blasting and we were singing away happy as we could be I never thought we could be so happy driving for a long period of time in a vehicle Whether one mile to your destination or 687 miles it is still the most comfortable ride I have ever had Car buying can be such a hassle but this buying experience was not not_My not_honey and I chose a beautiful red Explorer No matter where we have been I always am comfortable and feel completely safe Many of our friends have complimented us on how comfortable it is to ride in the back seat None of them get sick anymore How many vehicles have you seen like that It had approximately 3000 miles on it when we decided to take a trip down to Alabama to visit some family I was so amazed at the comfort and coziness for such a long trip
Pos,The Explorer is the best equipped most reliable and the most comfortable in its class The carseat fits great in the back and the dog loves being out of the weather My wife loves how easy it is to get the stroller in and out of the explorer vs the Ford Contour For value comfort resell value and safety look no further than the Ford Explorer When my wife and I decided to buy and SUV we looked at them all the Rodeo Pathfinder Blazer and 4 Runner Although the Pathfinder and 4 Runner were very nice they just couldnt touch the complete package offer by the Explorer I have a 9 month old and a dog The Explorer makes traveling them the two of them a breeze
Pos,The front optional Captain chairs are very comfortable and roomy The Air condition and Heater is great The 2 in the front can hold the biggest drink out there even a 1 liter water bottle However the standard speaker system is pretty lame and the in dash single CD player will skip if you go over really rough roads The Cargo area with the fold down rear seats is great for hauling everything from Christmas trees to home remodeling supplies This vehicle isnt not_equipped not_with not_the not_Rear not_Heater not_AC not_vents but with our summer trips to Florida and Winter trips to Michigan the rear passengers were always comfortable And since the back windows are darkly tinted we dont not_have not_the not_sun not_bake not_effect not_Unlike not_other not_passenger not_cars not_my not_young not_son not_has not_never not_felt not_car not_sick not_in not_this not_vehicle However the rear seating isnt not_all not_that not_great not_for not_adults but children seem to be content with the rear seat comfort and they like the added feeling of being up high with the wider window visibility The Gas mileage is only about 20 mpg at best and the passing ability on 2 lane roads is poor but I assume this is normal for V6 SUVs hey this is not not_a not_sports not_car not_Cup not_Holders not_Awesome And the 2 in the back are a blessing with kids Snow Wish I could report but we ve had a couple of really mild winters here in the Midwest and I havent had a chance to try her out But shes great for going over curbs Ford Explorer are everywhere Here in the Midwest it would probably be very easy to find repair shops and parts to work on this vehicle when its off warranty When I signed a 2 yr lease for a new Explorer I had never had a SUV I Cant believe I lived so long with out one I have 22 000 miles on the Explorer and the my plan is to purchase it at lease end My only warranty repair work has been the Firestone Tire recall and the rear window wiper motor stopped working The AM FM receiver is great I can get radio stations I never could in my other vehicles
Pos,On June 28 2000 I took possession of my 2000 Ford Explorer The standard joke was the little men dancing on my dash board In fact there is going to be a problem and it will be ignored We are used to these lights and their warnings are going to be ignored at the wrong time That summer I was driving a friends mother to the dentist on a regular basis along with the regular trafficing of children mine and others But frankly I think Foard should be sending an expert out once and for all I do not not_want not_a not_new not_car It does in fact drive perfectly Although I come to ignore the check engine check fuel gauge and fuel cap lights THIS IS DANGEROUS In particular we would check out who accompanied the little man with the pillow on his lap I am writing this in October of 2001 It all ends up with ANOTHER visit in same symptoms I was told by a woman at the regional headquarters that I had a guardian angel on my dash board Of all the parts that have been replaced for example side air bags in the fronts seats and air bag in the steering wheel wiring harnesses etc nothing has totally solved the problem It could have other problems I do not not_like not_the not_2002 not_I not_like not_my not_car not_I not_want not_my not_car not_fixed not_I not_do not_not not_want not_to not_do not_a not_trade not_in not_In not_all not_the not_visits not_and not_all not_the not_replacements not_of not_parts This beautifully designed car this wonderful car to drive is still a nightmare for the techs at the dealership Lights on the dash board disappear after a visit and reappear flashing new codes I am quite upset with Ford that they cannot not_and not_have not_not not_sent not_someone not_out not_from not_Detroit not_to not_fix not_this not_car not_once and for all Ford has not not_supported not_the not_local not_dealership It has actually only changed the flashing codes and the number of lights that come on We are told that this is the only car with this problem that the dealership has had to deal with It seems that Ford must have encountered this problem with this model vehicle before or in other models Nevertheless this is a Ford problem and should be a priority I am very unhappy with FORD Maybe I should be directed to another dealership
Pos,It climbs with the best of the factory 4X4s Much roomier than my trucks and turns on a dime Happy You bet What a difference I now get close to 16mpg around town I even get 12 3 mpg average crawling around the rocks in 4 wheel drive I took out the auto locking hubs and replaced with Warn locking hubs This is my first Bronco ive always have had full size 4X4 pickups im really impressed with its handling and power Mine has the 5 8L engine I was only getting about 10 mpg around town and 14 on the highway I increased this dramatically along with its power by putting a K N fuel injection performance pack air filter I also switched out the stock coil with a Crane I put a 3 inch cat back exhaust WOW
Pos,This thing is zippy The lines are smooth and rounded It feels like it could fly It really takes some getting used to Brakes Good Solid antilock brakes It has room for several adults and lots of gear The engine certainly provides more than enough power for a vehicle of this size I just purchased a Ford Explorer four wheel drive two door SUV and I love it This truck is outstanding Room The Explorer is very roomy No complaints there Ammenities Air conditioner power locks power windows AM FM cassette stereo all the standard bells and whistles I just wish it had a CD player Aesthetics Mine is red Very red Thats about all you can ask for In conclusion a great vehicle all around wonderful with two points of worry steering takes some getting used to and doesnt have a CD player It has a very pleasing look to it The gray interior is a nice counterpoint to the bright red exterior it provides a calming effect Overall this thing looks great Safety Seat belts natch air bags two Anti lock brakes And with the 4wd engaged it can go through just about anything I cant not_wait not_for not_winter not_to not_get not_her not_so not_I not_can not_run not_it not_through not_some not_serious not_ice not_snow not_and not_mud not_Handling This truck corners very nicely really grips the road However I do have one complaint the steering seems a bit loose a takes too little pressure on the wheel to turn and this causes it to seem unstable The back seat folds down for extra storage space I recently transported two large mountain bikes in this vehicle and they fit with no problem in fact there was quite a bit of room to spare Power and Speed Oh yeah
Pos,But thats their story Boy how I hated Fords As long as I can have another EXPLORER In other words the doors will NOT open from the inside The lumbar pillow is adjustable by pressing another button located directly above the seat positioning button For those who have children or visiting grandchildren you ll enjoy the standard child proof rear door locks We began looking at various trucks and SUVs Actually at that time our SUV was considered to be a truck At the time I was buying my Thunderbird I thought it would be the perfect vehicle I was dead wrong In addition to the driver and passenger airbags the other safety feature I like best is the 4 wheel anti lock brake system and side door guard beams There was more wrong with this car than right and Ford couldnt seem to find and fix all the problems that existed with this monster This way should you only have one back seat passenger but a whole lot of items to carry you can lower only the one seat and your passenger can sit comfortably and enjoy the ride So much for a name Anyway at a local Ford dealer we spotted a very handsome SUV called the Explorer XLT with 4 wheel drive Living on Long Island NY with a married daughter in the hills of Connecticut we realized 4 wheel drive was necessary When the lumbar pillow is inflated it definitely comes in handy to relieve the pressure off my back and make the ride so much more comfortable Since the back seat fold down individually its most convenient when company comes to visit and we load the back with supplies Whether doing the unbearable 30 mph here in my small town of PGI or the more enjoyable 80 mph on I 75 on our trips north the engine has never failed to give its best never once hesitating or failing in any way Our model is equipped with a 5 speed O D Automatic transmission However these locks CAN be turned off for the comfort of adults sitting in the rear Another part of my Explorers standard equipment is the very functional 4 wheel drive CONTROL TRAC drive electric shift transfer case and rack pinion steering In addition to its independent front suspension all four wheels have powered disc brakes There was no effort at all in fitting into tight parking spots and the mirrors located on each front side door along with the rearview mirror makes spotting any surrounding vehicles a piece of cake My Explorer has electronic seats which makes it easier to position for either my husband or myself Just one press of the button will easily bring you forward or back Put the button up and the seat rises up for those people like me who like to sit higher in the seat Push that same button down and the seat lowers for those taller people who need the extra head room And speaking of the back there is more room than we know what to do with which now that we live in Florida comes in handy for our trips to the north at Christmas and the addition of so many grandchildren who love toys My Explorer came with a 4 0 EFI Fuel Injected Catalyst V6 Engine After all these years the pick up this engine emits is awesome While there are just so many other little things that make this vehicle a dream to own and drive the most important is that ive found it to be almost maintenance free With the exception of periodic oil changes and finally tire changes we have had to do nothing else not not_even not_a not_brake not_change not_yet not_This not_SUV not_truck has certainly changed my mind about Fords Would I buy another FORD We decided to trade it in and buy something new My die hard Ford loving husband wanted a Ford I wanted something

not_might not_be not_the not_way not_to not_go not_Ford not_seemed not_to not_make not_better not_trucks not_than not_cars What first attracted me to the Ford Explorer was its looks I wanted a mid sized truck that didnt not_have not_the not_spare not_tire not_hanging not_on not_the not_way not_of not_the not_back not_hatch Neither did I want something that looked like an over sized station wagon Seeing the Explorer I took it for a test drive I was immediately impressed on its easy handling Although I had been driving a small Miata and sometimes the Thunderbird when it wasnt not_in not_the not_shop not_the not_larger not_vehicle not_was not_just not_as not_easy not_to not_maneuver not_through not_heavy not_traffic I think the Ford Explorer is a great car for active people who are looking for something large enough to store and haul equipment and yet want the maneuverability of a small car The Explorer offers both ive had my Explorer for over five years and have found nothing to dislike about it In fact we praised our Explorer so much that when our friends needed a new car they went directly to a Ford Dealership and bought the sports model of the Explorer which is a bit smaller than ours but suits them fine
Pos,As a side note the stereo on this Explorer is very good no clipping or distortion I highly recommend this Ford Explorer I own a 1997 XLT V 6 SOHC I purchased this vehicle c of its value great engine performance still has great pickup after 2 5 yrs and had all the options I wanted without getting a lot of other useless features Driving this vehicle is very smooth It has a relatively good turning radius given its size I have driven it in rain great handling when going through mud puddles on the highways snow on the way to the mountains ice last Christmas and it is very controlled amp responsive Note this is an SUV so it doesnt corner as tightly as a car sport car but the pros outweigh this con also this is the same problem for other SUVs of this size When I was looking for an SUV it looked for a minimum of a V6 which shut out a lot of the smaller SUVs power for the money I looked at a Jeep Grand Cherokee but would have to get a V8 in order to get any pickup it would ride high as opposed to a Subaru full time 4WD so I wouldnt not_have not_to not_be not_changing not_back not_amp not_forth not_thus not_discounted not_Toyota not_4 not_Runner not_wide not_back not_seats not_i not_e not_the not_amount not_of not_room not_to not_get not_into not_the not_back not_seat not_this not_discounted not_a not_Land not_Rover not_Discovery not_you not_have not_to not_really not_twist not_in not_order not_to not_get not_into not_the not_back not_seat not_lift not_glass not_in not_the not_rear not_door would recommend the Explorer read door configuration the same on a 97 Grand Cherokee i e it lifts up so you can stand under it which is quite nice in rainy Portland preferred the spare tire to not not_be not_in not_the not_cargo not_area not_I not_also not_required not_that not_the not_SUV not_has not_a not_Sun not_Moonroof not_amp not_CD not_Player not_Changer
Pos,The creature comforts like heated leather seats are wonderful and make for comfortable driving trips This product has proven completely reliable comfortable and utilitarian and I highly recommend an Explorer for a family or adventurer The rear seats fold easily and cargo is protected by an easily removable cargo cover Driving position is comfortable for my 6 3 frame and also for my smaller friends I haul all sorts of things and pull a three place snowmobile trailer with sleds with no problem I highly recommend the Explorer for the demanding consumer who wants a long term reliable vehicle Either the V 8 power or the V 6 is great ive had both and the V 8 has full time all wheel drive which is helpful for those of us who commute in snowy climates Its a strong engine which warms up quickly and started yesterday after sitting in a parking lot for 60 hours in five degree temperatures
Pos,They have a great time riding with me This is a great car and I do recommend it The only time I feel uncomfortable is on Sunday going to church and I have so far to step up in a dress This is a perfect car for me because I travel a lot and I feel very safe in it and also I am a grandmother to four wonderful children When I bought my first Explorer I owned a Town Car by Lincoln I never felt very comfortable in it because I always felt it was not not_me not_When not_I not_traded not_it not_for not_my not_Explorer not_I not_felt not_like not_I not_had not_been not_liberated not_I not_have not_more not_fun not_driving not_this not_car not_than not_any not_I not_have not_ever not_owned not_I not_now not_own not_my not_second not_Explorer not_and not_will not_buy not_another not_when not_the not_time not_comes not_to not_trade
Pos,On the other hand its rack and pinion steering system is among the best both in feel and precision The Explorers strongest suit continues to be roominess even though its been upstaged a bit in this department by the Durango The same can be said for its braking and the improved ABS reduces the unnerving pedal pulse and noise that still afflicts some antilock systems An even more significant enhancement added for the 97 model year is the option of a new overhead cam 4 0 liter V6 engine and a five speed automatic transmission As with the Durango the four door Explorers long wheelbase 111 5 inches and limited ground clearance conspire to make it a marginal choice for tough off road conditions The Explorers handling was no better than average in our track testing marked by strong understeer and a slight tendency to lift the inside front wheel when pressed to its limits If thats likely to be on your menu the two door version is a better bet with packages designed to enhance clearances and a much shorter 101 7 inches wheelbase I personally own one and I love it Still the best selling sport utility on the planet the Explorer rolls into 98 essentially unchanged from its 1995 redesign although a number of details have been improved including refinements to the Control Trac automatic 4WD system and for 98 standard four wheel antilock brakes The Explorer also has one of the most attractive interior designs of any sport utility excellent seating and like most of its competition a wide range of features and options Some of the trim packages the Eddie Bauer and Limited versions for example will send the price well over 30 000 But if you shop the option list judiciously the Explorer is still a good buy with or without 4WD Our only major caveat Avoid the base engine Even though the base V6 is the only one offered with a manual transmission the new overhead cam engine makes the going much more pleasant The new V6 came along a little too late for our testing last year so that was our prime focus for 98 and when the dust had settled we emerged with a strong respect for this new engine With 205 horsepower and 245 ft lbs of torque 45 hp and 20 more ft lbs than the standard V6 a 4 0 liter pushrod design the new V6 delivers far better go and hauling power a 5 800 pound towing capacity versus 5 300 pounds than the anemic base engine Ford also offers a 5 0 liter V8 option but the 4WD system that goes with the V8 does not not_include not_a not_low not_range not_feature
Pos,In 1996 we had twins In 1995 I met my husband In 1998 we bought a minivan We rarely used all 7 seats in the minivan The rear cargo area of the Explorer is roomy and functional There is plenty of room for our family and one extra passenger In the back seat there are seat pockets in front of each child a big bonus There is also a larger than average glove compartment and makeup mirrors on both the driver and passenger visors We hauled lumber last week and still fit both of us and the two kids in the car The Explorer is just a COOL vehicle especially up here in the Pacific Northwest where everybody and their neighbor owns an SUV In the front seat there is a nice console between the driver and passenger including space for CDs cassettes 2 drinks and a little slot just perfectly sized for our cel phone The only major drawbacks to the Explorer are the excessive road noise sometimes thats nice though as it tends to lull the kids to sleep and the poor gas mileage There are a couple of features on this vehicle that really stand out First is the rear glass can be opened separately from the rear door The vehicle is sturdy survived a rear end collision this winter that caused 2 500 in damage to the other vehicle and left our car with not not_even not_a not_scratch not_roomy not_and not_safe Id LOVE to see Ford and for that matter every other manufacturer who hasnt already done so integrate cup holders into the back seats Its a nice feature and its one thing I do miss about the minivan That way if you just want to stick some groceries in you dont not_have not_to not_open not_up not_the not_whole not_door not_Another not_wonderful not_feature not_is not_that not_the not_whole not_car not_can not_be not_locked not_unlocked not_via not_a not_well not_placed not_switch not_inside not_the not_back not_door Id worked briefly for Ford in the mid 90s During that time I had driven a couple of Explorers and really loved em Unfortunately price was a major issue plus after we had the twins everyone convinced me we needed the dreaded minivan for more on that see my separate review It holds a LOT of stuff we do lots of camping and is at waist height so its easy to load unload without too much bending and reaching Also easy to vaccum 1 3 of the back seat also folds down flat so that you can fit in longer things Yes the road is practically littered with Explorers but maybe im just not not_the not_stand not_out not_in not_the not_crowd not_type not_Now not_for not_the not_specifics not_I not_personally not_love not_that not_the not_Explorer not_has not_less not_space not_than not_the not_minivan not_From not_7 not_seats not_to not_5 not_I not_thought not_it not_would not_be not_a not_sacrifice not_but not_it not_hasnt not_been So while im loading the groceries I can unlock the doors for the kids without having to fumble for my keys Our Explorer also includes a towing package making it capable of towing up to 3 500 pounds about the size of a small travel trailer or boat a nice cassette stereo system and roof rack Ack what were we thinking But before I go on and on about the dehumanizing effects of driving around in that giant green 7 passenger egg let me just say how relieved we all were when we finally got RID OF IT and in 2001 bought ourselves a 1997 Ford Explorer XL Id been enamored with the Explorer since And speaking of space that minivan seemed to just attract junk Well the Explorer does too maybe its not not_the not_car but the kids who attract junk but it attracts a lot LESS junk and is a breeze to clean out The seating itself is comfortable roomy enough for our larger than normal derrieres and for both kids to spread out a little in the back seat We fill up about once a week and thats with average daily around town driving A freeway trip to Seattle 180 miles round trip costs us about 10 12 in gas Expect about 280 miles per tank full on the highway and about 200 in town I guess thats just what we expect when you buy an SUV though we have to trade something for all that space We also have had the opportunity to use the 4WD a couple of times and it worked flawlessly Its shift on the fly so there is no need to get out of the car to lock the hubs or anything annoying like that Our repair bills knock on wood have been negligible we keep the oil changed and keep up on the schedule maintenance and I know im jinxing myself here she runs like a gem
Pos,I LOVE my Ford Explorer Id go for the Explorer And note that I say bouncy not not_bumpy The safety features of the Explorer are also a plus If I wanted a smooth ride I would ve bought something lower to the ground If you have the means and are ready to move into the SUV class I would recommend an explorer My wife used to cringe at the thought of me driving around in my little Sentra that had no airbags let alone crumple zones or reinforced doors And if you want a smoother ride you ll probably have to dish out a few thousand extra bucks and go for one of those luxury manufacturer SUVs It handles very well stops nice and has enough power to get you around that 18 wheeler that is weaving from side to side and it is very very quiet If you want good gas mileage and a smoother ride you might want to look at one of the smaller SUVs from those manufacturers that make the high gas mileage economy cars But if you just want a good solid American made car though Id venture to guess that few cars are completely made in America today that gives you the best features of a passenger car with the versatility of a pickup Though you do bounce up and down over a speedbump or a bump in the road you are not not_being not_racked not_around not_like not_a not_rock not_in not_a not_tumbler not_Its not_more not_smooth not_like not_a not_waterbed not_Another not_thing is that it gets really poor gas mileage Again good gas mileage is for Honda Accords and Toyota Corollas The trade off is worth it to me If I have to fill up a little more often its worth the power and space I have and the tank is 20 gal so it does last a while even with the poor mileage Other than the bouncy problem driving the explorer is like a dream It is very comforting to have a safe car I cant not_say not_that not_im not_totally not_without not_complaints but I have learned to live with the few I have about the Explorer Okay so it is a bit bouncy its a truck its supposed to be bouncy As I sat in many a traffic jam in my tiny little aging economy car I longed at the Explorers that sat in my view Considering my situation newly married and planning a family in a professional job having hobbies including skeet shooting woodworking and other things that would require some cargo space I felt that the Explorer would be an excellent car for me The best things about the care in my opinion are being up high looking sharp and having an excellent balance between cargo space and passenger space I am no longer ashamed to drive my bosses around but I can still haul a big pile of wood and tools from Home Depot when I get the urge to try that weekend woodworking project or help my friends fix up their homes
Pos,The dash is laid out really nice and I love the middle console It has pretty good pickup for a V6 I didnt not_get not_the not_4 not_wheel not_drive but plan to the next time around It also provides some privacy I find it gives me a very comfortable ride even on long 7 hour trips At the time I didnt not_think not_I not_would not_really not_need not_it but it would have been nice to have My husband drives a Lexus and says the explorer drives like a truck but that I know I still think it is a comfortable ride for a truck It holds my cds and a tissue box holder is build in And if I need to slide in something larger than the back cargo area I can fold down the back seats I bought this 1997 Ford Explorer because I wanted to upgrade to something larger than a car but not not_a not_mini not_van I can tow should I need to but dont not_on not_a not_regular not_basis not_Its not_big not_but not_not not_too not_big not_I not_love not_the not_adjustable not_seats not_Being not_only not_5 not_2 not_I not_can not_set not_my not_seat not_just not_the not_way not_I not_want not_to not_And not_I not_can not_see not_over not_the not_hood not_I not_have not_the not_tinted not_windows not_which not_I not_think not_keep not_my not_explorer not_cooler not_in not_the not_hot not_sunny not_south

Pos,I own a 1996 Ford Escort I love it Even though a 4 door it is still small enough to fit into the smallest parking space which means alot to me If your looking for a car that handles great in the winter this is your car This car is the most reliable car ive owned yet I bought it used and though 4 years old I havent had a single problem with it yet Also though small it is still quite roomy I think this car is an all occasions car good for family teenagers just starting out or anyone Also has an awesome heating system
Pos,Its just a great reliable little car We d definitely buy an Escort again and plan to stick with Fords in general in the future We commute 600 miles a week and have 115 000 miles on this four year old car and shes still running strong In all those miles we ve only spent about 1500 in maintenance on her We tried to run her out of oil on a trip to Canada keep forgetting to get the oil changed dont not_get not_her not_washed not_enough but she still keeps going Very comfortable even for 2 larger people in front Run medium grade gasoline in her and shes very peppy on the highway too Even with all those miles our Escort still averages 30 MPG with an even mix of highway travel and in town traffic

did obscene things to me via the vibrations of the base through my car seat and sped up to 95 mph on Montana highways with a mere 5 dollar speeding ticket to show for it Ah those were the days After crashing my CRX several times and being put into the high risk bracket of car insurance I decided to purchase a less sporty car and made the horrible decision of buying a Dodge Colt in a shade of puke tan from a used car dealer in my neighborhood After the lowered self esteem finally made me realize I simply must find something better I gave the Colt to my roommate for Christmas it could have gotten maybe 200 max if I sold it anyway and withdrew some savings to purchase a 1991 Red Ford Festiva CUUUUUUUUUTE The following technical stuff is taken from www cars com along with my notations in

Pos,It handles well in the snow and has an AMAZING turning radius We bought our 1991 Ford Festiva new and the Korean Komet or Red Rocket is still serving us today The car gets incredible mileage and almost never needs repairs and it starts up in even the coldest of weather You could park this thing anywhere I guess the only downside is that if you should get hit in this thing theres not not_much car to protect you Other than that I think the car has a lot of personality and is a great value im a high school student and I just put a new sound system in and now I can cruise for chicks in my sweet ride while blasting out the beach boys tunes Woooo
Pos,It cornered wonderfully This is awesome Then I would definitly check out the Escape THE SHELL We are stationed overseas in Okinawa Japan through the AirForce When I drove the SUV it was SOOOOOOO smooth NO rattles whatsoever Which is why I decided to write this review after our test drive You can get the 7 speaker system added on but for about 600 more Sheesh It did score a 3 star rating on the roll over resistance rating for both the 4 wheel drive and 2 wheel drive If the Aztec is too out there for you or if you just think it is ugly If you are military I highly suggest that you check out your AAFES dealership before considering another dealership Great experience Thanks for reading my review I am not not_a not_car not_professional but wanted to comment on these 2 vehicles in a safety comparison If you are going from a Mustang or some other sporty get up then you may be disappointed I sure wasnt When I found out that the Aztec had this feature also I was sold otherwise it would have been the Escape It seams for such a large larger than a car vehicle with an upgraded sound system they could at least throw in a few more speakers To make a long story short we chose the Aztec Dont get me wrong I think the Escape is great vehicle Good luck in your SUV purchase I am also writing a review for the Aztec so check it out if you are interested GOOD LUCK We are used to driving old foreign junkers that we picked up for about 800 or less just to last us through our tour and also allowed us to save some money The only options that I did not not_get not_with not_my not_price were 1 leather seats 2 the side stepping bar I did get the Choice XLT model higher than the Value and lower than Sport but did not not_want not_Sport not_anyhow It was peaceful my kids were

rare breeds that actually LOVE the styling of the Aztec My husband on the other hand fell in love with the Escape which I had to admit was my first choice before spotting the Aztec We decided that since we are leaving Okinawa for Hawaii or Guam it was time to buy a new car for all of our hard work and sacrifice in paying off bills Enter the debate Ford Escape OR Pontiac Aztec Now some of you will immediately shout out Ugghhh NOT the Aztec But I fell in love with the Aztec immediately Those U turns we all need to make from time to time would be SOO easy as the wheel turning radius have no idea if I am using the right terminology seems very tight nice sharp turns Parking was a breeze as again the wheel turning radius is nice and sharp I felt no roll at all when making quick and fast turns This is the highest rating that SUVs have gotten except for the Pontiac Aztec 4x4 4 door which scored a 4 out of 5 stars the 2 wheel drive Aztec scored a 3 While there have not not_been not_any

that protects the entire front end and continues around the sides using side intrusion door beams steel beams along each and every door for protection in a crash I have to young girls who sit in carseats on the outer back seats and this feature makes me feel all warm and cozy inside knowing that they are protected Throw in the dual and side airbags and I am on cloud nine On a low note I did feel that for the XLT model the controls and front panels were a bit basic looking Nothing high tech but a small tradeoff for the superior safety you get from this SUV Another thing that bothers me is the gas mileage which is supposedly around 19 24 But I knew this going in to an SUV I guess if gas mileage is a big concern for you then forget the SUV and opt for a sedan or passenger car Another more minor detail that bothers me With the XLT you get the 6 disc in dash cd changer system but only 4 speakers On the Aztec 6 speaker is standard I believe with also some speakers in very back for tailgating usage Some other feature that the Aztec has that I think would be nice on the Escape are as follows 1 HUD heads up display projects speed and other info onto the lower windshield so you can always see it without taking eyes off the road Come on Ford add that on the Escape 2 Acceleration volume control made that term up to lol as your speed increases the volume on your stereo slightly elevates and visa versa as speed decreases 3 Power outlets in rear of vehicle Aztec has outlets in the rear for use during camping cleaning etc Just a nice touch 4 Stereo controls on the steering wheel I want that man Oh and also the price I was quoted is from the AAFES Military car sales
Pos,I traded in my Lexus so im new to SUVs and American made vehicles But I was looking for something that would give me more flexibility and was fun to drive the 2002 Escape fit the bill I first test drove the sister SUV the Mazda Tribute and was instantly hooked There is lots of cargo space which I have really enjoyed a nice retractable cargo cover and an adjustable luggage rack I guess im spoilt by the Lexus but I find the carpets in my Escape to be a little skimpy I just keep reminding myself that its a truck When I started doing research I discovered that Ford sold the identical minor trim changes vehicle but usually at a lower price and Ford was offering much better financing terms and more for my trade in A week after taking delivery on my 2002 XLT V6 with leather interior and the premium sound system I went on a 4 day road trip and must say that overall I found the truck very comfortable very economical and fun to drive The leather seats are comfortable by not not_luxurious not_the not_stereo not_on not_the not_other not_hand is actually better than the Lexus great system I like to drive with my headlights on and the 2002 comes with auto lights out after about 2 minutes but the irritating thing is the dinger still sounds when you leave the lights on I dont not_see not_the not_point not_of not_having not_an not_auto not_lights not_out not_feature not_if not_the not_alarm not_is not_going not_to not_sound There is considerably more road noise than with my Lexus but I figured it was just because you are sitting up so much higher and you have all that trim and luggage rack that adds to the wind noise I have read several reviews that talk about engine noise I have heard none just wind noise at high speeds I do have a complaint about the placement of the steering column shifter it does block easy access to the volume button on the radio but once you get use to it not not_a not_problem
Pos,The interior 1 Very nice It looks sporty rugged and classy at the same time 4 The controls seem to plain such as the AC controls vents etc The front looks ready for off road similar to an Explorer And one last thing this SUV does not not_cost not_too not_much not_to not_insure I am not not_going not_to not_write not_about not_stats not_and not_specs not_for not_this not_SUV The power brakes are good but does not not_have not_the not_car not_like not_stopping not_power This SUV provides an overall good balance in terms of 1 Price 2 Features 3 Performance Also one complaint I have was it has no air vents for the rear seats The leather is comfortable and I was impressed with number of features it offers for the price That is mostly available in car magazines and many other websites First impressions 1 From the outside it looks larger and meaner than a comparably priced Toyota Rav4 or Honda CRV It looks tough and durable and not not_quite not_as not_cute as other comparable mini SUVs 2 The two tone body color takes a little getting used to I liked the silver color so it blends a bit better with the black 3 I really like the factory alloy wheels It has power front seats large moonroof very roomy for a small SUV and the gauges are nicely located and very easy to read 2 The Mach Audio system is probably one of the best factory sound system I have listened to It comes with 6 disc changer and 7 speakers 3 The drive 1 It was a bit on the loud and rough side 2 Acceleration is car like but I was hoping it would be faster since it is after all a 201 hp V6 carrying a fairly light load I have driven the 4 Runner which has less power and heavier but seems to accelerate just as fast I suppose the powerband of the Fords Duratec V6 is geared towards more on the upper RPMs 3 With its independent suspension the Escape handles like a car and show no hint of tilt or body roll on a fairly fast 90 degree turn 4
Pos,The Escape does everything well Id plunk down my own hard earned dollars to own one My complaints about the Escape are ironically centered around its strengths The V6 is powerful but it sucks up gas and is VERY noisy The Escape was easy to drive for long periods and was an enjoyable airy place to spend time However the AWD was slow to engage off road and the minimal ground clearance for an SUV didnt not_help not_matters Of course most folks will never use the Escapes SUV ness in anything other than snow and rain and im sure that the all wheel drive is perfect in these situations Though the Ford is very good at lots of things it seems to have sacrificed being truly great in any areas to be so competent overall The Escape felt much more like a tall station wagon than a true SUV while off the pavement I recall my mothers Explorer feeling much the same when taken off the beaten path Then again the Jeep would go literally anywhere on road or off I feel that the new Land Rover Freelander is similar more uniqueness but less utility I think if it were my on the line I recently had the chance to rent a loaded Escape for a week long business trip an experience I have been looking forward to having Overall I liked the Escape a great deal but im not not_sure On the highway and back roads the Escape handles better than almost every other SUV ive ever driven large and small I even had the chance to take the Escape off road a little bit and it was less happy there The ride and handling are great in 90 of situations but one cannot not_sling not_this not_thing not_around not_a not_highway not_off not_ramp not_at not_high not_speeds not_Finally not_to not_make not_such not_a not_fine not_vehicle not_it not_feels not_that not_Ford not_has not_cut not_costs not_in not_building not_materials not_and not_construction Of course none of this changes the fact that the Escape is a great all around car and I would certainly recommend it to friends who have lots of for fuel and who are already hard of hearing Id go for the redesigned Honda CR V Sure its be a little slower than the Escape and certainly more dull to both look at and drive but the Hondas quality and fit and finish would be impeccable it would be more efficient and have even more room So would a number of other terrific choices though I feel that a Jeep Liberty is just as pleasant a place to spend time and the Jeep has lots more character both inside and out The Jeep also handles poorly though and is just as thirsty and loud as is the Escape So much so that the radio has to be blared to drown out the sound As long as you have plenty of CDs which you enjoy on hand you will never mind but there is no Escaping the fact that this is a noisy and thirsty vehicle It is amazingly roomy and well laid out for such a small vehicle Seat comfort was great there was TONS of cargo room ride and handling were very enjoyable and the V6 performed well Ford offers lots of well thought out gadgets and toys in the Escape things like armrests and storage compartments and radio controls feel especially well placed and engineered The Escape I drove had lots of rattles and felt and sounded generally loose but this may be due to the fact that it was a rental and rentals are usually beaters Still a brand new car shouldnt not_have not_felt not_so not_loose not_I not_have not_been not_thinking not_about not_getting not_a not_small not_SUV and the Escape would be high on my list
Pos,This pickup handles all of our familys needs Although the diesel engine gets better mileage than a gas engine The full crew cab gives plenty of room for up to six people It is a workhorse for the farm and a pleasure to drive and ride in as a family car The power stroke diesel gives all the power you could want when passing on the highway even when hauling or pulling a load The 4 wheel drive is great when it comes time to get hay out of the field or when off road We live on a small farm and needed a truck to haul feed and livestock Since our children are now teens we knew that the extended cab was ready to be upgraded to a full crew cab The new scalloped front driver and passenger windows are really a great help for seeing small cars beside you This is a great vehicle for people that need to haul and have a family Because of the relatively low gas mileage I would not not_recommend not_it not_for not_total not_pleasure not_use not_or not_for not_singles not_or not_couples
Pos,My F350 is a fine truck however having problems with Ford fixing two major problems Problems are as follows 1 My truck is a early model The air intake is in the fender well and I have a problem a loud sucking or as I call it a loud howling noise from that area Fords district mgr refuses to fix the problem Dealers in other areas have solved this problem by rerouting the air intake to the front grille like the later Ford models and this does fix the problem 2 When I start the Powerstroke after setting for awhile I get a loud thump noise from under the hood I continually complain about this but nothing seems to be done to fix it
Pos,The 1999 Ford F 350 has an awesome look to match its awesome abilities Take it for a test drive and feel the power of Ford Triton engines Put on a camper shell if you want to use it for travel The model we purchased has four doors the long 8 ft bed 4WD and is toped off with the Triton V 10 engine with enough horsepower to satisfy any truck fan Big and roomy Ford made this truck to complete many tasks that will fit everyone From hauling 8 ft sheets of plywood moving a friend taking huge loads of branches to the local dump taking a long family trip or even for a mountain hunting trip this truck is truly built ford tough Personal recommendations You can fit 6 people very comfortable so having the shell will enable you to put all of your travel needs as well as shopping bags in an air shell for both room and protection With a shell on the long bed this truck will be bigger and badder that the suburbans and even Fords new Excursion Also putting a supercharger will bulk up the already tremendous amount of horsepower so I wouldnt not_call not_it not_a not_necessity not_Put not_on not_a not_2 not_or not_3 not_chamber not_Flowmaster not_muffler not_to not_get not_out not_that not_loud not_V not_10 not_sound and if you like custom vehicles change the tires and rims to either get a Lower sleeker look or a higher tougher look
Pos,As the saying goes Try it you ll like it You will leave a Dodge Cummings in the dust if you are both pulling a hill the power is fantastic The adjustable seat belts make it easy for a tall or short person to be comfortable and not not_have not_a not_strap not_rub not_them not_over not_their not_neck The mileage factor with the 7 3 is fantastic when you are not not_pulling not_a not_load not_22 not_mpg not_is not_normal and under load 18 is average The Ford F 350 with the 7 3 Turbo diesel is the best truck on the road With its 500lbs of torque it will pull just about anything Horse trailers trailers are no problem for this truck it pulls a hill with a trailer behind it as if it was not not_there not_at not_all not_Comfort not_is not_a not_given not_in not_this not_truck not_wether not_you not_get not_the not_40 not_20 not_40 not_seats not_or not_the not_Captains not_chairs not_you not_will not_ride not_in not_comfort
Pos,The brakes on the F 150 are excellent with very good stopping power The only thing I could say is that they are relatively touchy So far with my F 150 I have added many accessories to my truck like 3 inch body lift 33 inch mud brute tires 5th wheel hitch in the middle my truck bed K N high performance air filter Delta toolbox Reese hitch The handling on this vehicle is decent the turning radius isnt not_the not_best but all around it is alright I havent ever had a load on the vehicle that has ever effected the handling So if you are out there and looking for a truck with all around use this is the one for you it hasnt let me down and I dont not_believe not_it not_would not_let not_you not_down not_either At the age of 16 I bought my first 1992 f 150 it was a great truck it had 100 000 miles on it and still ran like a top I added a K N filter and it upped my horse power and shortly after that i added dual exhaust and man did that baby roar I had very little engine trouble If you are out there and you are looking for raw towing power along with horse power and a comfortable smooth ride on and off the highway with a drivers seat that you could sleep in that will get you around anywhere then the ford F 150 4 wheel drive is the way to go One drawback to this vehicle is the gas mileage on the regular stock truck I would get about 16 17 mpg on the highway and about 13 14 in town but now that I have the 33 tires and the 3 body lift I get about 9 10 in town and 11 12 on the highway In that fall of 2003 I sold this truck but not not_because not_of not_the not_truck not_I not_just not_wanted not_bigger not_and not_better not_so not_I not_bought not_my not_second not_1992 not_F not_150 not_I not_can not_haul not_anything not_that not_I not_need not_and not_have not_all not_the not_horsepower not_any not_country not_hick not_like not_me not_would not_need not_I not_have not_never not_been not_stuck not_even not_though not_I not_have not_tried not_I not_have not_many not_late not_night not_calls not_to not_pull not_vehicles not_out not_of not_ditches not_or not_mud not_and not_have not_not not_had not_a not_problem not_yet not_This not_truck not_also not_has not_over not_100 not_000 not_miles not_and not_I not_have not_yet not_to not_have not_any not_engine not_or not_transmission not_problems not_probably not_due not_to not_the not_fact not_that not_the not_engine not_is not_very not_strong not_and not_has not_great not_get not_up not_and not_go not_power not_and not_the not_tranmission not_has not_very not_smooth not_shifting not_I not_would not_put not_my not_1992 not_F not_150 not_against not_any not_full not_size not_truck not_out not_there not_Now not_I not_am not_now not_18 not_years not_and not_have not_been not_a not_F not_150 not_lover not_for not_2 not_years not_now not_and not_will not_never not_go not_back not_Not not_only not_have not_I not_not not_had not_any not_mechanical not_problems not_but not_no not_structural not_problems not_either not_I not_am not_more not_impressed not_with not_this not_truck not_than not_any not_other
Pos,I bought my wagon used in 1994 Its a 1992 Put it this way 2 adults 1 child with car seat luggage for 10 days and 1 120lb dog all fit in this wagon Low mileage and price is what first brought me to this car Upon test driving it though I really found that I liked it even better It was a nice ride im not not_one not_for not_mini not_vans not_or not_SUVs so this was a good option for me ive never had trouble fitting anything and everything in this wagon And the only problem that I have had is the fan that cools the engine that should come on and off depending on temp doesnt and still cannot not_find not_anyone not_who not_can not_fix not_it not_Though not_I not_have not_figured not_a not_way not_around not_it not_I not_know not_that not_when not_this not_wagon not_needs not_to not_be not_replaced not_no not_question not_in not_my not_mind not_it not_will not_be not_another not_Escort not_Wagon
Pos,It was a wonderful car and always reliable and dependable I used to own a 1992 Escort in college and it was a great car If you re thinking about buying a used one in this era I would strongly recommed that you get one with the cam you wont regret it I loved the car It was a 5 speed with the dual overhead cam which made for a very sporty ride People were always surprised by the performance and I was always very pleased with it The interior was extremely comfy with lots of room in the back seat 4 door pleanty of head and leg room and the trunk had generous space as well I bought it used and never had to fix anything on it well once I had to replace the battery
Pos,The Volkswagen was just too expensive for the amount of room and features Wind noise is not not_at not_all not_objectionable and the seats are comfortable The interior looks postively cheap like it was lifted right out of a Chevette The brakes std ABS in the SES are very good Steering with the variable assist is linear and handling is also very good The Pontiac has sooo many tacked on plastic body clading it looks like a third grade car design competition gone amok The EPA rates this as a large car and interior room is very good with the exception of the front wheel well intruding on your left foot space It is reasonably quiet and the 4 speed automatic transmission shifts smoothly however it does not not_allow not_manual not_selection not_for not_the not_full not_range not_of not_ratios To me it was a no brainer With 4000 in rebates and the ability to purchase at dealer invoice the initial value is just too hard to pass up Having recently purchased a 2003 Taurus age is finally starting to get to me At least I am not not_too not_old not_as not_I not_did not_not not_even not_consider not_a not_Buick not_LeSabre not_Aint not_middle not_age not_great Which brings us back to the Taurus I know that the resale value will not not_be not_as not_good not_as not_the not_Japanese not_as not_these not_vehicles not_are not_the not_choice not_of not_rental not_car not_companies not_and not_commercial not_fleets There are simply a ton of Tauruses on the roads and the law of supply and demand dictates that when it comes time to sell or trade dont expect much The Impala would not not_have not_been not_a not_bad not_choice not_as not_it not_is not_slightly not_better not_equipped not_for not_about not_the not_same not_price not_however not_the not_engine not_is not_of not_a not_cast not_iron not_pushrod not_design not_that not_has not_been not_around not_since not_Louis not_Chevrolet not_built not_his not_first not_car not_in not_1912 Of all the mid to large size cars available in this class one has the choice of the Chevy Impala the Pontiac Bonneville and the Dodge Intrepid from the domestic manufacturers and the Nissan Maxmia the Honda Accord the Toyota Camary the Mazda 6 and the Subaru Legecy from Japan and the Hyundai Sonota from Korea plus the Volkswagen Passat from Germany The plus to this situation is that normal wear and tear parts will be easy to come by and downright cheap to obtain I purchased a Taurus SES with the Sport package With this I received the 3 0 DOHC Duratec V6 two tone cloth bucket seats special alloy wheels and a rear spoiler plus Ford threw in a free sunroof The wife was parcial to getting the leather interior and the wood package however with the dog to be riding in the back seat perhaps cloth was the better choice Stepping up to the SES trim Duratec combo helps avoid having the car appear to be a rental vehicle Driving the Taurus reveals that the Duratec is smooth and powerful and with a chain driven camshaft design I will not not_be not_worring not_about not_replacing not_the not_drive not_belt The only major gripe that I have is that the cheap plastic console squeaks and that is houses the equally cheap 6 disc CD changer magazine that was made in China I could have done without the rear spoiler as I seriously doubt that it adds much downforce or makes the car handle any better With Ford pushing the metal out the door with incentives this allows one to purchase a fully equipped Taurus for the price of a fully equipped Honda Civic Nissan Altima or Toyota Corolla What you dont not_get not_for not_your not_money is somewhat minor Rear disc brakes are only available in the wagon model however with the front brakes handling 80 of the braking force this is a non issue A power adjustable passenger seat is only available in the top of the line SEL model so your front seat passenger will just have to deal with that the best that they can Side air bags are also a option Some of the places where Ford also saved money is in the use of cheap feeling switches however they all do work and perform their intended uses The issues I had with the Dodge is that the 2 7 liter engine has a dubious history as I have seen many fail prematurely due to the water pump failing and the pump itself is built into the block All of the cars from Japan except the Maxmia and Subauru come standard with 4 cylinder engines I prefer a 6 cylinder but where they are an option this prices them a couple of thousand more than a Taurus I had driven a Hyundai Sonata and was somewhat impressed however it was smaller inside and I later found out that Hyundai had lied about the horsepower figures for the 2 7 liter engine and had to offer consumers cash or an extension of the warranty
Pos,The back seats were barely there Then I came to the Ford dealership They showed me a few Explorers and I was hooked Also when they say 4 wheel drive they mean all 4 wheels They have a good V 6 engine good sized front and back seats plus a decent storage area in the rear for all my gear It is a 5 speed manual transmission a must for me and it has push button 4 wheel drive with low range No problem for soda cans but a Burger King cup gets knocked out every time I shift to third gear The Montero is nice and roomy but the mileage sucks its expensive and the insurance on them is outrageous for someone my age 21 at the time This baby does it all with room to spare and good gas mileage too I had looked at the Montero the 4 Runner and the Blazer first It always starts for me no matter what the weather is I have started it in 100 and in 40 below without any problems Other than that minor bit its a great SUV and I couldnt be happier I just topped 100 000 miles and im sure I ll see 200 000 easy It also has an adjustable luggage rack on top and it got 20 miles to the gallon highway and 17 city Mine is the 1991 Sport Edition so it only has 2 door but thats all I need anyway Not one front wheel and one back wheel like some other companies do Really the only thing I can complain about is that there is only one cup holder and it is inconveniently located behind and below the shifter knob Then I looked at the 4 Runner Nice decent mileage and it has a fair sized cab but again the insurance was killer plus they seemed to be breaking down a lot and were not not_cheap not_to not_fix not_Now not_the not_Blazer not_was not_really not_nice not_Good not_mileage not_fairly not_cheap not_insurance but it was really really small inside When I first started looking for another car I knew I wanted an SUV of some type I do a lot of traveling on the road and I like to have room for all of my luggage camping gear and emergency equipment as well as my passengers It also has a main dome light and 2 reading lights for the driver and front passenger I signed the papers for it the same day and I have not not_had not_anything not_to not_complain not_about not_since not_then and that was almost 4 years ago I have had it in the shop for basic maintenance and had to have the radiator and water pump replaced my fault though but other than that it has run great for me
Pos,Not only does the Explorer have more storage room it is also much more comfortable to drive My Ford Explorer is very reliable and I feel safe driving it I highly recommend the purchase of a Ford Explorer I have had my 1991 Ford Explorer XLT for a little over a year I bought it with 105 000 miles on it During this time I have driven it for over 30 000 miles I have had it in the shop only for scheduled oil changes and tire rotations I drive every day for work in all weather conditions I also drive my Explorer off road from time to time The Ford Explorer runs well and has excellent handling on snow and ice as well as in the mud I was particularly happy with my Explorer on December 28 1999 when I was driving to Columbus from Cleveland as the first winter storm of the year blew through blanketing the streets with snow and causing white out conditions I was driving south on US23 toward Columbus and I counted 14 cars along the side of the road One accident was a 6 car pile up After seeing these accidents I was cautious but I felt comfortable in my Explorer Needless to say I arrived home safely and I credit much of my safety to my Explorer I have compared it to a Chevy Blazer of a similar year and the Blazer does not not_compare
Pos,My driving skills are very aggressive especially off road I have owned a 91 Explorer Sport for nine years If this is done you too may own a vehicle and still love it after 10 years This has placed me in several awkward and embarrassing moments due to my driving The Explorer came through everytime and I dont not_even not_have not_all not_wheel not_drive not_capability not_Parts not_can not_be not_expensive not_and not_hard not_to not_find but there worth it I have never once broke down or have experienced a component failure I do recommend upgrading stock tires to more aggressive tread and a K amp N Filtercharger for increased performance Explorers do need constant care and attention
Pos,What parent isnt We bought the Explorer from a private party who practically gave it to us Well I was quite the wreck when she turned 16 last year and was got her drivers license It even has a tilt sunroof for a 91 Its almost in excellent condition except for some minor rust on the underside and a missing handle on the inside I highly recommend this vehicle I am extremely happy with this vehicle I am a over protective mom of a teenage girl about to turn 17 years old We gave her this vehicle a 1991 Ford Explorer XLT for her birthday and to ease up on our schlepping back amp forth during very hectic work weeks They didnt not_want not_the not_hassle not_of not_having not_every not_Tom not_Dick not_and not_Harry not_coming not_over not_to not_see not_it not_After not_some not_initial not_repairs not_were not_made not_we not_brought not_it not_in not_to not_the not_owners not_mechanic and had the front brakes done along with the power steering unit everything else was in order we got the vehicle for 2 750 Yes you read that right Although it does have 90 K miles on it They were initially asking 4 000 then down to 3 000 then after repairs we had the gall to negotiate to 2500 we then settled on 2750 My daughter is the proud owner now and is quite smitten with her brand new SUV I want it I feel very comfortable with her driving it Its a safe vehicle I like the size and sturdiness of it She handles it beautifully
Pos,Just a few minor fixer uppers The reliability is amazing The v6 engine is nice and powerful perfect for anyone The over all look of the inside is well done The 95 FORD Contour is really a great car for anybody The 95 Contour is also very spacious Especially in the front The air conditioner vents are nicely designed and well placed The quality of the interior is nice nothing fancy but definitely nice and comfortable It runs great every time I start it up ive had it for 6 years now and absolutely no major problems The back seats arent too cramped though and they could fit any average sized person comfortably I am really impressed with the space this car has I cant not_say not_enough not_about not_the not_over not_all not_quality not_and not_reliability not_of not_this not_car not_Very not_nice not_for not_long not_or not_short not_trips not_Highly not_recommended
Pos,The Contour makes those trips easy It had about 93 000 miles on it and was still virtually trouble free The only problem I can remember was with the sunroof switch not not_factory not_installed When the car sat in the sun and got hot the switch wouldnt not_work It was reliable economical and comfortable And I hope its new owner enjoys it for many years to come And you wouldnt not_hear not_the not_squeal not_if not_you not_turned not_up not_the not_radio not_a not_little not_o not_I not_loved not_owning not_and not_driving not_this not_car I bought my 1995 Contour brand new off the showroom floor in July 1995 From day one it has been a joy to drive comfortable easy to handle and fuel efficient The car now has 70 000 miles on it It has required minimal maintenance you know the usual tires brakes oil changes etc and has been incredibly dependable In the last few months I owned the car I noticed a bit of a squeal in the AC but it continued to cool very well even in the hot Houston summers And the air conditioner works very well a critical issue in the Texas heat While I dont not_drive not_every not_day not_many not_of not_my not_trips not_keep not_me not_in not_the not_car not_for not_one not_to not_five not_hours not_at not_a not_time That took two trips to the dealership to get fixed Looking at the car it was not not_my not_first not_choice not_I not_thought and still do that it is a sort of boring little lump It is always a challenge to find a car both my 6 5 husband and 5 1 me can drive I dont not_have not_any not_trouble not_reaching not_the not_pedals not_in not_the not_Contour and my husband doesnt hit his head on the roof At one maintenance visit the dealer service department mentioned that the AC clutch was a little loud but didnt not_recommend not_doing not_anything not_because not_in not_their not_words not_the not_AC not_was not_pumping not_out not_ice not_cubes not_I not_hadnt not_heard not_the not_noise not_and not_the not_AC not_continued not_to not_work not_well My husband begs to differ he loves the styling My mind started to change the second I sat in the car and I was sold as soon as I drove it It also helped that I found one in teal a color I love My original plan was to keep this car about six years however as we get closer to the six year mark I find myself thinking I dont not_want not_to not_give not_it not_up not_that not_soon not_Update not_10 not_02 not_I not_recently not_sold not_this not_car not_after not_owning not_it not_7 not_years not_and not_a not_couple not_of not_months The only reason I decided to get a new car was that I take quite a few long road trips and I was concerned at nearly 100 000 miles that it might become less reliable I didnt not_want not_to not_have not_the not_cars not_first not_breakdown not_on not_some not_deserted not_stretch not_of not_Texas not_highway not_My not_original not_review not_of not_the not_1995 not_Ford not_Contour not_stands
Pos,It is not not_very not_flashy not_or not_overly not_sporty It is very reliable and has nice creature comforts CD sunroof power everything I bought my Contour with almost 100k and it still runs great It doesnt have much get up and go but I do feel very safe with dual airbags and traction control It gets decent gas mileage and seats four adults comfortably I would recommend this car to someone looking for endurance at a good value This car is also very easy to work on and parts can be found at most major parts stores I would recommend attempting personal maintenance over dealer maintenance which I was disappointed in the one time I took it to them
Pos,The speedometer is broken There are many pros to this particular car The hydraulics for the hatch wont hold up the hatch anymore I got a 1991 Ford Mustang GT from my parents back in 1991 for my senior year It is still fun to drive around town and see how many people turn their heads These are the majority of problems I have had The door handles were just poorly made The donut tire is really small and if you were in a bind you cant not_drive not_it not_very not_fast So there are a few pros and cons to the 1991 Ford Mustang I feel that the pros heavily outweigh the cons The major problem I have had with my car is minor parts breaking I have replaced the inside and outside door handles more than once In fact it will almost go too fast I have had it at an ungodly speed that I do not not_wish not_to not_diverge not_here It will get up and go with the best of them 2 Handling I went to school at the University of Arkansas my first year of college They agreed to repaint the door but it had new paint on it The rest of the car had paint that was around four years old It didnt not_match and you can still tell it today 3 Spare tire I know this is very minor but I really wish they would have included a regular sized spare tire with the car Then my wife and I can cruise around town in a 30 year old car that looks brand new Actually I hope one of my kids wants to drive it when they get old enough This particular model was the first year Ford put five star rims on it In my epinion this makes the car much more appealing to the eyes Cons 1 Cheap minor parts I think that Ford spent all of their money on the engine and transmission Yes I would like to have a new car but im not not_getting not_rid not_of not_my not_pony not_I not_plan not_on not_keeping not_it not_forever not_I not_am not_going not_to not_rebuild not_it not_fix not_the not_minor not_things not_that not_are not_wrong not_with not_it not_and not_get not_a not_new not_paint not_job There are also a few cons I will list each of these below Keep in mind that this is a 10 year old car that has run like a charm ever since I got it Pros 1 Acceleration and speed I have never had a problem with the acceleration of this car They have some plastic parts that arent very strong 2 Service at dealership I know this isnt not_really not_dealing not_with not_the not_car but our local dealership is very hard to deal with It is Smith Ford in Conway Many times they refused to fix something that they actually screwed up I had them put on a new door handle many years ago and they scratched the paint The road I chose to take was very windy and I loved it Never once did I lose control of this car or even have the tires slip I typically doubled each suggested speed limit up to around 30 mph 3 Looks Even though this car is 10 years old I have tried to keep it looking good especially on the outside I still get some looks from people while I am driving because the car demands looks from others They always told me they would buy me and my sister one good car to go to college on and that was it After that I would have to buy the next one Little did I know that I would still be driving this car almost 10 years later Well thats exactly what I am doing and I havent had it in the shop for more than minor work ever I have never had to take it to the shop to do any kind of work on the engine transmission or other major parts
Pos,She spins tires in third gear which for the engine type is impressive It gets me to work and back its quick off the line it looks great and ive had many offers Its over the 110 000 mile mark and NO LEAKS Now it is not not_only looking almost like new with its original paint but well accessorized as well ive added many performance products to this 2 3L car and have gotten the response of a V6 while maintaining the exceptional gas mileage It has visited the shop about 3 times for regular maintenance radiator clutch cable differential gasket Other than that ive done all the tune ups and oil changes Runs like a dream smooth quick and just plain exiting Unfortunately you see too many of these cars on the road looking like they havent seen a rag or sponge in years the better you take care of it the better it will take care of you ive had my 1991 Ford Mustang LX for 3 years now I had just come off a bad relationship with an 86 Cadillac and found this rather sorry looking Mustang for sale by a private owner I picked it up with hopes of exchanging it within a year for something better but it seems to be getting better with age I did an awful lot of cosmetic work on the car because its previous owner did not not_care not_for not_it not_properly
Pos,As soon as I turned the key I knew I was wrong Fords 4 6 liter modular V 8 emits a tense growl through the exhaust pipes at idle Blipping the throttle was a sensory experience even at a standstill At cruise however the mechanical noise which is so electrifying under acceleration became plain old noise making conversation hard in the pony car I could imagine long road trips with this car becoming an exercise in the What did you say maneuver Don Garlits the Big Daddy of drag racing is who I think of after test driving a new 1998 Ford Mustang GT Before driving one I thought of the Mustang as just another sporty looking spineless car for secretaries and factory workers to flog to work and back But then I came to the next stoplight yes on a divided highway and had a chance to dip into the V 8s strong point Burnouts a la Mr Garlits I am proud to say that I executed a perfect right hand throttle turn bringing the rear around smartly and hooking the tires back up to rocket off down the next road An engine with a snarl like this one means business i even if its 230 horsepower is lower than the perennial competitor the Camaro I slipped the perfectly angled shifter into first and idled no make that burbled out to the road First gear came and went with a mechanical howl and second gear did much the same Then my wife informed me we re already going 40 And so we were in about as much time as it takes to read this The city ended and the road opened up into a divided highway and I explored the 40 70mph roll on power With a muted scream the Stang accelerated straight up to speed When we climbed into the cars black interior I instantly noticed the exceedingly plasticky dashboard the uncomfortable seat the flimsy door panel the obstructed rear view and the infant sized rear seat Although the actual driving position was nearly perfect steering wheel shifter and brakes were precisely where I needed them to be I was pretty sure the cars only redeeming feature was the brand cache of the horse dancing on the grill When we returned to the Ford dealer my heart was beginning to settle down and we had stopped our crazy talk of canceling our order for a new Volvo which at that time was in the works Summed up the Mustang GT has a marvelous engine transmission and brakes in search of a comparable car because as soon as the ignition was switched off the uncomfortable seat creaky dashboard and all the rest were back again the wonderful machismo of V 8s and Big Daddy burnouts simply cant not_overcome not_it not_and not_the not_insurance not_companies not_who not_underwrite not_it not_will not_be not_happy not_to not_tell not_you not_the not_same not_thing not_The not_Mustang not_GT not_Its not_a not_beautiful not_car not_to not_drive but I couldnt imagine living with one
Pos,The Mustang was exactly what I wanted It was also equipped with the cleanest brakes ive ever seen That means good ol stone age rear wheel drive Pretty much the reason cops amp cabbies prefer Crown Vics The standard 80 watt stereo with CD sounds excellent with plenty of clean volume and enough bass for anyone short of a rap fan Make sure your car gets to a dealer to have a silent campaign fix there is a kit available to re route the fuel hoses coming from the charcoal canister Otherwise the car has a tendency to pass a gasoline odor into the passenger compartment after the car has sloshed its fuel around in stop and go driving Its a free fix from the factory Overall the car is a pleasure I have a 80 mile round trip to work each day which means a lot of wear amp tear in a short time Having been there with front wheel drive and its mechanical weaknesses this time I wanted low tech and low maintenance If you do a lot of driving in these kind of conditions you should probably consider another car With 40000 miles on the car its as solid as the day it was made Nothing has failed malfunctioned or broken The V6 and 5 speed make all the power a grown up commuter could ask for while large 3 8l for its output 150 HP the engine makes plenty of low rev torque and will chirp its tires in second gear if asked All while delivering a comfortable if heavy ride One thing to be aware of is that on snow or ice you will IMMEDIATELY be aware that this is a rear drive car I would gladly have paid extra for the limited slip axle used on the GTs if it was available When they re due for replacement which wont be for a while yet I ll actually get the replacements at a Ford dealer they re that good The GT wheels that came with the Sport Appearance Package have a durable finish and are blessed by being free of nooks and crannies that make other wheels such a chore to clean
Pos,The only downside is the small back seat The car will really run too This is a sports car and not not_a not_family not_vehicle Other than that I have the perfect car That is the placement of the drink cup holder It needs to be back about 3 inches But eventually everyone should experience the fun of a mustang The back seat does not not_bother not_me not_at not_all not_in not_the not_driver not_seat There is only one thing that I would change about my car It sits directly behind my stick shift and sometimes a drink will get in my way Or at least it is a downside to my daughter who has the very long legs I have loved mustangs since I was old enough to drive I finally got one Not that I am a speed demon or anything Anyone who wants to have fun driving should get one If you are a young family with small children you may want to wait until all the kids are driving themselves She is small enough that I can move in and out of traffic with ease yet I am very comfortable when driving It was well worth the wait I have had more fun with this car than any other ive driven I bought the car used because I was just not quite ready for a brand new car Besides Mustangs always hold their worth
Pos,I love this car You are in control when driving this car This vehicle is the perfect car for college students young professionals retired persons alike When a person thinks of a two door car the first thing that comes to mind is SPACE The only people i do not not_recommend not_this not_car not_for not_you not_people not_with not_children not_because not_of not_the not_obvious not_lingistics not_that not_entails You get the feel of a sports car the handling of a sports car the look of a sports car at a non sports car price If you are looking for a car that is just right for you try a mustang you will NOT be disappointed It is not not_a not_worry not_in not_this not_car not_there not_is not_plenty not_of not_trunk not_space not_for not_those not_long not_trips not_a not_middle not_console not_to not_hold not_anything not_from not_cds not_to not_papers not_and not_plenty not_of not_leg not_room not_for not_front not_seat not_passengers What more could one ask for Standard on the car comes the one disk cdplayer a must for anyone these days who listens to music and the sound quality on the base model still out performs most cars This vehicle with its V 6 engine gets very good gas milage perfect for those who have long commutes to work or who just drive a lot Speaking of V 6 this engine gives you more bang for your buck even at 80 miles an hour it feels like 60 the car moves with you gliding along curves and passing the competition
Pos,The seats are somewhat uncomfortable especially for long trips Ever since high school ive wanted to own a Mustang GT I bought it two years ago with about every option imaginable and have been very happy with it overall It is a true sports car which means it was designed to drive fast and handle like a sports car not not_a not_cadillac not_Its not_a not_lot not_of not_fun not_to not_drive If you have a bad back this is not not_a not_good not_every not_day not_choice not_for not_you not_The not_4 not_6liter not_V8 not_packs not_a not_pretty not_good not_punch not_225 not_horsepower not_is not_decent not_not not_quite not_as not_fast not_as not_the not_Z28 not_of not_the not_same not_year not_but not_much not_better not_looking not_A not_few not_pet not_peeves not_the not_cup not_holders not_are not_ridiculous not_there not_is not_one not_huge not_one not_which not_if not_you not_put not_a not_drink not_in not_there not_it not_inevitably not_falls not_out not_on not_the not_floor not_and not_one not_smaller not_one not_which not_if not_you not_put not_your not_drink not_in not_it not_you not_cant not_shift not_into not_second not_or not_fourth not_because not_its not_blocked not_by not_your not_drink not_dont not_Ford not_engineers not_drive not_these not_cars not_themselves not_the not_head not_rest not_is not_set not_so not_far not_back not_that not_it not_might not_as not_well not_not not_be not_there not_at not_all not_sunroof not_was not_not not_an not_option not_I not_had not_to not_install not_myself not_for not_an not_extra not_1 not_000
Pos,The only complaint I have had is that the gearbox is very tight compared to other car I have driven which initially was very frustrating The down side is lack of comfort in the back seat for passengers and limited trunk space Headspace is tight especially if you are tall but over all this is a very sharp car The car handles very well and looks exceptionally sharp on the road If you like to drive on windy roads I highly recommend the standard VS automatic for the fun of maneuvering all those curves I have the 98 Mustang GT and much prefer the rear end style so I was glad I didnt not_wait not_for not_the not_99 not_to not_come not_out not_The not_car not_over not_all is a great car and a lot of fun to drive Top down or up this car is a lot of fun to drive over the coast highway and draws a lot of attention Mileage at 18 25 mpg is certainly acceptable for a high performance car Even adding the luxury of leather seats a high performance sound system and 16 inch wheels the price is well under 30 K
Pos,The sound system is awesome It is not not_for not_hauling not_or not_transporting not_people not_long not_distances If your looking for performance then buy the GT Cobra or Saleen The day we bought it the wife and I were going skiing The total mileage was around 410 miles I got awesome gas mileage and we werent fatigued from driving the car The cockpit is designed perfect for driving this car Even though it has seats in the back in my opinion its a two seater This is one stock stereo system that is not not_getting not_taken not_out not_The not_upgraded not_rims not_and not_tires not_are not_sweet but will be pricey for replacement My tires can not not_be not_rotated not_because not_they not_are not_directional not_tires not_but not_I not_accept not_that not_If not_you not_left not_this not_car not_stock not_you not_would not_always not_have not_a not_fast not_sports not_car not_for not_a not_great not_price But if your like me you can modify it to you tastes the mod bug has bitten me On a scale of 1 10 I give this a 9 Have fun The car stock car is very quick Handling is excellent and road noise with the convertible is minimal Again if you dont not_want not_to not_hear not_the not_road not_dont not_buy not_the not_Conv First off let me say the Mustang is one fun car to drive I have read every review of this car and I have to say that people are buying this car for the wrong reason You cant not_buy not_a not_6cyl not_and not_complain not_that not_it not_doesnt not_drive not_like not_a not_GT not_Example not_you not_wouldnt not_buy not_a not_Jeep not_without not_4x4 not_Buying not_this not_car not_one not_has not_to not_keep not_in not_mind not_that not_this not_car not_is not_for not_fun not_and not_speed My kis however can fit back there now but the older they get the more cramped it will be Longer leg people might not not_like not_driving not_this not_car not_im not_6 not_2 and with the seat all the way back I just barely make it So test drive one before you buy Now with that said on to my experiences I recently purchased a 1998 Mustang Gt Convertible I havent owned a new car in over 10 years and I was ready After many discussions with the wife she recommened the Mustang I have always thought that is was a cool looking car but I really knew nothing about it So the search begins I got everything I wanted except a manual transmission I believe that a sports car should have this so you can control the throttle But I ended up changing my mind and I dont not_regret not_my not_decision not_at not_all not_now not_I not_can not_hold not_my not_coffee not_and not_drive not_I not_own not_a not_Dodge not_Ram not_2500 not_Diesel not_Chevy not_Venture not_Van not_so not_I not_wanted not_a not_play not_car
Pos,The Mustang had so many more options compared to the Grand Am First of all it comes fully loaded including power locks power windows CD player automatic seats etc To our suprise the Mustang had plenty of knee room and space to sleep in the back seat I love the storage compartments and the cell phone adaptor I have not not_had not_any not_problems not_with not_this not_car im very pleased with my car I got to choose a new car for my graduation present I always wanted a Mustang but I never thought my parents would buy one for me After looking at many types of cars I narrowed my decision down to a Mustang and a Pontiac Grand AM The price of the two cars were the same but I would of been a moron to choose the Grand AM because it did not not_have not_to not_same not_package not_deal not_I not_took not_the not_car not_off not_to not_college not_with not_me and found i could get most of my stuff in it because the trunk is pretty big and the back seats fold down I recently went on a road trip with three other people in the car I thought it would be miserable for the passengers
Pos,My next truck will probably be a Ford F250 with a Powerstroke I have had Ford F250s in both 7 3 and 6 9 diesels Both have great power and reliability The thing I like about the 91 model is the 5 speed transmission the 85 is a 4 speed My 91 has about 240 00 miles on the engine and still runs great and will not not_burn not_any not_oil not_I not_have not_been not_very not_pleased not_with not_both The 6 9 was a 1985 model with over 300 000 miles on it The 7 3 is a 1991 model Both are 4 wheel drive and were used on the farm to pull stock trailers Both get about the same fuel mileage which is about 17 mpg highway unloaded and about 10 12 mpg pulling a 16 loaded stock trailer Both also have 4 10 rear ends which I think is a little low but they sure do pull good The bad thing about a 4 speed is they top out at about 75 or 80 mph the 5 speed tops out at about 95 It has no trouble maintaining about 75 to 80 mph on level ground and slight hills big hills will of course slow it down but not not_to not_an not_unacceptable not_speed not_Fords not_diesel not_engine not_is not_made not_by not_International not_the not_Powerstroke is basically a 7 3 with a turbo and modified injectors
Pos,We purchased a Ford Escort wagon brand new in 1998 The ride is smooth and seating is plenty Good mid income family value It was very economical and although I was not not_ready not_for not_the not_Wagon not_my not_two not_kids and a dog were With soccer baseball volleyball and choir practice I needed a car that I could fill with kids and or equipment and still save money on gas This car gets great gas milage I have safety locks on the back doors so the kids cant not_roll not_out not_into not_the not_street not_and not_a not_pull not_over not_shade not_to not_hide not_anything not_in not_the not_hatch not_from not_the not_sun or would be theifs I have yet to have a breakdown except when I ran out of gas LOL and other than a problem with the ghost in the dome light this has been a great family car I did have the dome light replaced only to continue having the problem of it coming on sporatically Now I have it turned off entirely With that one problem I feel I am doing pretty well this car has been a wonderful car for a family that couldnt afford a luxury car
Pos,The 1997 Ford Escort is highly reliable but somewhat less impressive to be seen in than its distant cousin the Mustang The trunk likewise is surprisingly roomy with enough room to pack for a weekend getaway with a clotheshorse spouse and an infants accessories The trunk is also accessible through the fold down rear seat which gives much needed added room when bringing 2X4s home from the hardware store The Escorts sturdy frame is a surprise but this 4 bangers pep keeps pace with that surprise Its speed however does not not_keep not_pace not_with not_radar or NY State Troopers police band radios Caution is needed for the heavy footed unless you opt for the cruise control feature The compact has a very small turning radius which in city driving is crucial Another benefit for city drivers is the way the Escort holds its alignment After 1 1 2 years of driving the pothole laced Monroe Ave in Rochester NY and discovering many of the previously mentioned potholes I have yet to need an alignment On the down side the drivers seat is just enough off center to help your chiropractor keep up the payments on his timeshare Additionally the headlights tend to go out a little too often The Escort though is sweet on gas scoring nearly 30 MPG in stop and go driving And with its front wheel drive its an economical option to SUVs for winter driving
Pos,However even the base speakers pack a punch in a little body The 4DR models with a spoiler and moon roof and the 2DR ZX2 are also very stylish The 1997 Escort is the perfect first or second car for young drivers and a reliable auto for anyone If your concern is that it appears to be a weak grocery getter rest assured the designers did a good job creating a trendy smooth look The best part about my model is that the back seats fold down creating a massive amount of trunk space and wide enough area to fit long objects like my hockey sticks The only problems I have encountered in 2 years of used car ownership have been minor electrical problems with the dome light and trunk light I also needed to buy a special CD player installation kit from Circuit City when I put in sound system The precursor to the highly touted Ford Focus the Escort is a small economical car My 1997 Escort is a 4 DR with a small engine but can really crank out the gas mileage Even today with 50 000 miles I average around 29 30 miles a gallon I have relied on this car for two years to drive me 5 hours to college and make multiple road trips
Pos,I really enjoy my little red 1997 Ford Escort The horn also seems to require a lot of pressure to get it to honk My aunt actually picked this car out for me as it was a moderately priced used vehicle bought May 98 for 10 000 It has a nice rear window defrost I also enjoy the remote control trunk and the foldable back seats Driving is very pleasant the car is comfortable and responds well The size seems just about perfect for easy handling for one thing Also the heater works very well to warm the car up fairly quickly on a cold day faster than my mothers Taurus The model I own is a 4 door perfect for my family of 4 Anyone who likes a maneuverable comfortable small car should buy it I suppose those with large families or hauling needs shouldnt The only things I dont not_like not_about not_it are minor I dont not_like not_the not_cup not_holders not_anything not_larger not_than not_a not_small not_can not_tips not_over not_when not_you not_turn not_sharply not_also not_the not_gear not_shift not_will not_smash not_larger not_cups not_when not_you not_put not_the not_car not_in not_park
Pos,So we checked out the dealerships for Chevrolet Dodge GMC Saturn Ford Jeep and many others The interior and exterior are holding up pretty good after 4 years but nothing is child proof You have enough room to move around and not not_get not_cramps but i wouldnt not_try not_stretching not_out not_to not_much My wife and I live paycheck to paycheck just like most of the World does and our current car was falling apart quick It had everything we needed Four doors for easy access to the loading and unloading of kids an air conditioner and a tape deck for me We looked all around looking for the cheapest and the best car we could find Once we looked at the escort we knew thats what we wanted So when we decided that that we needed a new car we sat down and talked about what we wanted With a tight budget we knew our choices were limited All I wanted was an american car with a tape deck The engine is still in good condition after 50 000 miles in 4 years routine maintenance conducted regularly but the leg room leaves something to be desired Granted the leg room isnt not_anything not_like not_a not_Geo not_Metro not_or not_a not_ford not_festiva not_where not_your not_knees not_are not_in not_your not_chest She wanted a car with four doors since we had a 1 year old and one more on the way and an air conditioner since we lived in Georgia at the time I was very stern about buying american because thats what keeps out country running and I feel that every time you buy something foreign an american worker loses his job
Pos,One afternooon I was at a used car dealership and saw a silver 97 Escort in my price range It looked like a small happy meal box on wheels or maybe just a tanks Well to get to the point We had an 88 or 89 when I was a kid and it was one of the most atrociously ugly cars ive ever seen I surprised myself when I ended up buying a used 97 Escort last year I was in the market for a new used car but I had sworn to myself and my dad that I wouldnt not_get not_an not_escort The main reason I chose to test drive it aside from it being silver my favorite car color was to get my dad to stop bugging me about one Miraculously I realized it was a great car while I was driving it It has decent pickup for a car in its class and has wonderful handling I bought it that very afternoon im still very happy with my purchase though ive had a few small problems with it since I bought it The service engine light came on repeatedly the first couple of months and then we found out the light itself had gone bad I recently had the check coolant light come on from time to time but that stopped once I had the radiator serviced Overall it is a great car for someone who doesnt have a lot of money to spend on a car but wants something sort of nice that handles well Oh and the title of this review is Hillary because I have a Hillary for Senate bumpersticker on my Escort and it seems to be its new name
Pos,The Explorer eats too much The ride inside the Explorer is quiet soft and smooth You can barely hear the motor or the transmission My average consumption improved a little after I installed the PowerJet There is not not_other not_SUV not_that not_offers not_the not_comfort not_luxury not_and not_beauty not_of not_a not_Ford not_Explorer You love your wife but sometimes she eats too much I love my 1996 Ford Explorer XLT This is useful when it starts raining and you want your tires to stick to the pavement The engine is powerful enough to handle the truck but may be a little less responsive in short accelerations I corrected this problem with the installation of a PowerJet 150 This is a car to fall in love Everything is powered the back seat radio and air conditioning console is definitely a plus Mileage is definitely an issue The Explorer is great for long trips and its cargo area fits more stuff than you could imagine Believe me my wife brings the whole house into the car when we go on vacation It is nice attractive strong and quiet I bought this car to have my family in a secure vehicle when on road Before buying this car I tested similar SUVs such as Toyota 4 Runner Nissan Pathfinder Chevrolet Blazer and Mitsubishi Montero The Explorer comes loaded with a bunch of features you will not not_easily not_find not_on not_other not_SUV not_I not_love not_the not_knob not_activated not_four not_wheel not_drive not_that not_allows not_me not_to not_turn not_it not_on not_at not_any not_time not_or not_any not_speed not_without not_stopping not_the not_car It took me a while to know how to handle it It drives amazingly well in straight roads even at 90 mph but you have to be careful when cornering I had a transmission problem during the warranty period sort of a solenoid was replaced Few months later they replaced the gas pump solenoid too I recommend this truck to any family that wants comfort security and adventure My wife loves the sense of security this car provides and she can handle it easily Recently I decided to sell my Explorer and went looking for another SUV with better mileage None of the year 2000 models I saw could barely compare in features to my Explorer I still keep it it is a vehicle you want forever just like a wife even if she eats too much
Pos,The ford explorer is a very tricky car when i first bought it it was as if it was a dream it drives like no other and its very comfortable but after a few months of driving it began breaking down and loosing parts very fast not not_only did it stall all the time and had to change light bulbs batteries etc the cost became very great since i was having to fix it all the time it got expensive the parts where also expensive the car is a very safe car but you cannot not_take not_corners not_fast not_it not_topples not_over not_easily not_it not_is not_a not_very not_top not_heavy not_car not_it not_has not_room not_and not_has not_a not_big not_engine not_it not_handles not_nice not_in not_the not_snow not_over not_all not_i not_give not_it not_a not_three not_out not_of not_five not_stars
Pos,What a nice truck You ll see what im talking about If you Love Quality and You Love Comfort It handles well on the highway or over rugged mountain roads For instance say you put in 20 gallons of gasoline It had leather interior 4 WD the handling of it was excellent It tells you how soon you need to refuel when you need your next oil change etc This truck also got great gas milage I cant not_really not_give not_exact not_numbers not_right not_now not_I not_dont not_remember If you dont not_know not_if not_you not_d not_want not_to not_own not_one just go test drive one someday As for cons I never found any I would recommend this to anyone who wants a sporty vehicle but yet solid safe and sound It was my bosses I used to have to drive him around and things like that The particular Explorer that he had was a 1996 with the Eddie Bauer package Id driven through some snowy messes that I know I would have never made it through with my car and that truck just went through it like it was nothing This is the Vehicle for you Its not not_only sporty but it has many luxuries to go along with it I dont not_personally not_own not_this not_vehicle but I had it for about a month But I do know that for the amount of driving that I had done it didnt not_take not_as not_much not_gas not_as not_I not_had not_thought not_it not_would not_No not_different not_than not_what not_my not_car not_takes Either way you go you have great control Another feature I liked about this truck was the fact that it told you in digital numbers what the temperature was outside what direction you were going and everything You drive a little while and look at the meter it will tell you that you have 15 gallons left Great idea Ford I like that Power windows power locks combination lock on the door if you forget your key All great features of this wonderful truck
Pos,I own a 1996 Ford Explorer with leather interior and all the options It is a classy looking SUV that is luxurious to drive It has smooth handling and and has been very reliable Cornering is ok but sometimes tippy on very sharp turns Four wheel drive is excellent for winter conditions especially slippery stop and goes I would not not_recommend not_this not_vehicle not_for not_someone not_who not_is not_planning not_to not_drive not_on not_rough not_terrain It is very bumpy on rough roads and is better for road driving People who should buy this vehicle are small families individuals who are worried about driving in winter conditions and anyone who camps or participates in outdoor activities such as skiing or biking Overall this is a great vehicle to own because it is a nice ride is asthetically pleasing is good in winter conditions and has luxurious options
Pos,After buying and driving small cars Hondas Saturns even an MG for the past twenty years I was uncertain about going the SUV route But as my interests now require me to have more room for hauling around equipment I scuba dive I needed a vehicle that had more room The Explorer has all the room one needs yet also has the car feel I was so afraid to lose As I also commute over 100 miles per day to work this vehicle has gotten a rigorous workout 100 000 miles in three years and has not not_given not_me not_a not_single not_headache It truly is a utility vehicle it has the class and looks for going to a formal wedding yet makes itself right at home at the camp ground I am not not_a not_rugged not_individual not_actually not_a not_short not_40 not_year not_old not_woman not_this not_vehicle not_has not_not not_only not_changed not_the not_way not_I not_feel not_about not_SUVs not_and not_trucks not_in not_general not_I not_will not_most not_certainly not_purchase not_another not_SUV not_and not_probably not_another not_Explorer not_when not_the not_time not_to not_trade not_in not_come not_around not_But not_after not_over not_100 not_000 not_miles not_the not_car not_looks not_and not_drives not_like not_new not_so not_that may not not_be not_for not_quite not_sometime
Pos,The seats are cloth and very comfortable Wheel drive excellent for rail snow ice Puschased used with 60 000 miles This vehicle has power seats with lumbar and calf support which allows very comfortable adjustments This is an XLT model and is one of the best vehicles I have ever owned The remote outside mirrors leave no blind spots when properly adjusted Handling is excellent stearing is responsive and predictable It is one of the smoothest riding vehicles I have ever owned Twice in this time I have moved 400 and 900 miles and found the cargo capacity excellent Even fully loaded the handling is smooth I like the option of opening the rear glass or the whole tailgate In the 1st 6 months I have driven about 10 000 miles and have had no problems I have had to replace 2 tail light bulbs and the battery Regular service has included power stearing fluid change Transmission fluid change radiator cleaned and flushed and 2 wiper blades in addition to regular oil changes with Mobil 1 5W30 motor oil Excellent In my opinion this is an excellent choice for anyone who needs the ability to haul children and or stuff Front Rear seating is ample and comfortable Head and leg room superior to most I have driven Gas mileage is good Wind noise above 60 mph moderate Would recommend this SUV highly Since it has dual air bags small children should only ride in the back seat Auto 4
Pos,In 1996 I needed a new vehicle and since I already owned an 92 explorer I decided to go and see what more it had to offer OH MY GOD was I shocked THIS EXPLORER IS AWESOME I fell deeply in love with something that is not not_human not_I not_had not_to not_take not_it not_for not_a not_test not_drive not_well not_I not_did not_and not_I not_paid not_cash not_on not_the not_spot not_I not_couldnt not_believe not_how not_nice not_this not_vehicle not_is not_and not_to not_this not_day not_I not_will not_not not_give not_up not_this not_vehicle The EXPLORER has everything that I could ever dream of having in a car such as cd player air cruse the best ride ive found yet smooth when you want it fast when needed easy visuals and in dash equipment and much much much much more I ll tell you this if you like feeling in control or like going offroad or just taking a sunday ride or going shopping in comfort style and knowing you ll be fine in the snow and be seen in awwwwed then this is the ride for you As a matter of fact im in the market for a new one now and I just cant not_wait but I have to at least one more week im here to tell you that the ride and the feeling of being behind the wheel is such an experience that you will want to cherish forever and you ll try to keep it to yourself but you just cant not_do not_it not_because not_once not_you not_drive not_it not_you not_just not_want not_to not_keep not_on not_going not_forever not_and not_you not_ll not_have not_to not_tell not_someone not_your not_awesome not_experience not_that not_you not_will not_never not_forget not_sooner not_than not_later

Pos,So if y ou plan on off roading then do not not_get not_them Also the factory running boards are narrow and hard to use I do not not_recommend not_them Well what to say about the ford explorer limited besides that it is GREAT I recently bought a 1996 ford explorer limited with 54 000 miles for 14 000 There is an electronic control center that gives me such information as gas usage and oil information as well as much other useful info I bought this explorer for its handsome looks widespread popularity and size Which I consider a very good price considering that Kelly Blue Book value is 20 000 www kellybluebook com Since the limited is top of the line the interior is luxurious and comfortable It does what I want when I want it to I also like how my passengers in the back receive rear air an option in XLT and up Also the windows in the back go farther down than a Chevy Tahoe The explorer is capabale of off roading I know so because I have gone off roading it is not not_the not_best but does what any soccer mom sport utility is capable of The running boards hit A LOT of times when heading off the trail An aftermarket supplier can supply great ones Now lets hear about the cons THE ENGINE I would definetly go with the V8 In 1996 the V8 was not not_available not_so not_I not_have not_a not_4 not_0 not_V6 not_with not_160 not_horsepower not_My not_wifes not_1999 not_Ford not_Taurus not_SE not_has not_a not_200 not_horsepower not_V6 not_Also not_some not_of not_the not_interior not_is not_plastic not_feeling not_and not_kinda not_cheap not_looking not_I not_have not_had not_no not_problems not_and not_my not_carfax not_report not_was not_100 not_clear not_I not_definetly not_recommend not_this not_versatile not_sport not_utility not_to not_anyone not_with not_the not_need not_for not_it not_or not_for not_anyone not_who not_wants not_some not_comfortable not_driving
Pos,This is a solid truck that is proving to be a great value The paint has held up to the abuses of street parking in Los Angeles and San Francisco The ride is a bit rough for those looking for more of a car than a truck Other than changing the oil every three thousand miles and one thorough servicing 250 at 30 000 miles I havent spent a dime maintaining this truck Other than that the interior is extremely comfortable The Eddie Bauer package includes power leather seats with power lumbar support an excellent feature for long drives With 2500 in Ford Citibank dollars to apply toward the purchase of my 1996 Eddie Bauer 4x2 Explorer it was hard to choose another SUV However I test drove all the rest If I had to do it over I would have waited until 1997 to get the larger V6 The 160hp V6 in my Explorer is pretty weak and a 190hp V6 was offered in 1997 At that time the Chevy Blazer had the smoothest ride but the inside had too much plastic The Toyota 4 Runner was hot but close to 6 000 more than a comparably equipped Explorer Also I discovered that the insurance on a 4 Runner was 600 year higher After 45 000 miles my Explorer has operated with zero defects
Pos,It heats up quickly in freezing weather has minimal maintenance problems and smooth ride This vehicles looks are stylish and rugged at the same time and perfect for any occasion Those 10 000 miles werent easy either mostly driving through downtown Chicagos bumpy streets on my way to college I bought my Explorer for basically one main reason More Space I had previously owned a 1995 Pontiac Grand Prix GTP 2 door and its small back seat was cramping for my large dog Max This vehicle also has plenty of room for all necessary activities Shopping Clothes Groceries nights out in downtown Chicago carting around my 80 Lb Chocolate Laborador helping friends move driving to school camping etc etc My ONLY complaint with this vehicle is its horrible gas consumption I drive approximately 200 miles a week City Suburb and have to fill the 17 Gallon tank up each week All of the Ford Explorers amenities outweigh this one drawback and make me feel completely satisfied with this purchase He now has plenty of windows to look out and tons of room to move around as he desires Its also nice being able to go to Sams Club and fit everything I my mother my sister purchase into one car This SUV has outweighed my expectations This vehicle fits into my life well I am very much amazed at the reliability of my Explorer I bought my 1996 Ford Explorer used in September 2001 with 120 000 miles on it and two days ago it hit 130 000 I was amazed to have gone 10 000 miles without a single problem except for nails in my tire
Pos,The off road performance of the Bronco is good All the power accessories bothered me they tend to break These arms in turn stabilize the twin I beam front axle system The auto locking hubs can result in too little exercise for the front axle u joints The other aspect of front suspension component wear are the twin I beam control arms It has gone everywhere I wanted to go with no complaints or difficulties The truck had high mileage for a 2 year old machine but that did not not_seem not_a not_problem Hes right if you need exhaust headers replaced in a late model Bronco its a major job The key things that get loose are the large control arm bushings that stabilize the rear of the arms Once these joints start getting twitchy from lack of exercise they can cause the auto hubs to lock falsely By the way when you have ball joints done have the front axle u joints replaced while the whole thing is apart The auto locking hubs are a nice convenience but one of the first things I did was to replace them with Warn manual locking hubs You can get ball joints with lube points so if you replace the original set with these then keep them lubed they will last a long time If your Bronco is equipped with the auto locking hubs you cannot not_do not_this not_unless not_in not_four not_wheel not_drive not_so not_you not_have not_to not_be not_off not_road The right side is the most likely to have problems its close to exhaust system components and there are heat shielding bushing collars that protect the rubber part of the bushings I replaced my totaled Ramcharger with a 1995 Bronco XLT I looked around carefully read my review entitled Before you talk turkey inspect the bird I found what has been a gem The overall average is about 16 5 I do a lot of highway driving I noted in another review by a mechanic comments about the cost of repairs in the areas of ball joints and exhaust systems A check on the previous owner and contact with him confirmed that the truck had been used for a 60 mile commute all highway driving This Bronco has all the amenities you think you are driving around in a four wheel drive Lincoln So far after 2 1 2 years none have ive put over 100 000 miles on the vehicle since buying it it has the overdrive automatic transmission so at 65 miles per hour the engine is running at under 2000 RPM and can get up to 19 5 MPG if I leave the cruise control on 32x1150 tires The key to owning a Bronco and really any other vehicle is in the maintenance program Since in some areas theres more to an SUV than a regular vehicle there are added maintenance points that need to be attended to One of the things that you must do is to periodically lock the hubs and drive a while By the way if you are one of those who likes mudding remember that that mud gets into things and can reduce longevity unless properly cleaned out This is another truck that the manufacturer has discontinued in favor of fancier more expensive rigs aimed at the yuppie market Its a shame its a good truck 1996 was the last model year if you are looking for a strong machine that still has some not not_all of the simplicity of the basic pickup truck the Bronco can serve you well Over time the right side rubber bushing can get mushy from heat exposure Just keep an eye on it Another thing to think about this applies to Broncos with serpentine belts and any other vehicle so equipped periodically check the belt and remove it to make sure that the things it turns are without bearing or bushing noise and shaft play Make sure the idler and tension pulley bushings are good If something freezes up you are SOL Carry a spare serpentine belt if you travel in remote areas
Pos,It is a thirsty beast The wife and I have 2 growing boys and 2 dogs We originally bought the Bronco because it suited our family needs We love the easy viewing from on high and the basic ruggedness The Bronco is a great vehicle to comfortably haul the whole crew around It is also surprisingly easy to drive with power everything the size of the vehicle is generally not not_an not_issue We would recommend it to folks who really need a rugged powerful SUV and are willing to pay for it The Bronco is a vehicle that gives a lot of satisfaction but is not not_necessarily not_going not_to not_be not_cheap not_to not_feed not_or not_maintain The Bronco even makes a nice cross country traveler getting about 17 miles to the gallon on the highway Unfortunately the in town mileage tends to hover around 10 mpg The quality of the vehicle was generally good but we did have one major complaint Before the 15 000 mile mark we replaced the front brake rotors and calipers because they had warped This caused an annoying pulsing sensation when braking We took it to Ford several times where they would turn the rotors only to have them warp again within the next 1000 miles or so After 3 trips to Ford we went to aftermarket components Sperry which cured the problem and actually provided better feel than stock Cost was 450 00

Pos,There is even a separate control dial to give a different temperature for the back than the front The Windstar of course is an automatic and I can report that transmission was smooth and quiet We had to refuel 6 times during the trip including once to fill the tank before returning the car to the rental agency The controls were fairly standard lights on a dial turn signal and windshield wipers on a lever on the steering column emergency brake below etc We were also entertained by a little fold out mirror that allows people in the front to keep an eye on the back seats The front seat which is set against the door in the usual manner was a little better for sleeping but it still proved hard to find a good position We were carrying two large cardboard boxes five backpack sized bags of personal effects several smaller bags of snacks and odds and ends a video camera a microphone case a couple of poster tubes and some lumber We spent about 25 30 each time and concluded that we got decent gas mileage for a large vehicle Cargo space without the third row of seats was pretty much exactly adequate for our needs There were no aspects of the controls that we found to be odd or hard to get used to in the short time we were driving the vehicle We had slight problems with the temperature but only because I am always cold and everyone else in the car was always hot Mechanically the climate control worked just fine There are also many nice little nooks and crannies to store things elsewhere in the van including little cubbies between both front and rear seats a CD holder up front a coin holder on the ceiling etc This is a major selling point for Ford I think and I can report that it was indeed very handy not not_to not_have not_anyone not_having not_to not_climb not_over not_seats not_to not_get not_inside The cup holders in front were a little flimsy looking but did the job Cup holders in back were more solid and were a nice touch since we jointly consumed about 30

not_general not_moving not_needs We also liked the fact that the child safety lock feature which prevents the side doors from being opened from the inside was easy to turn off just flip a lever on the edge of the sliding door once its open It is also equipped with cruise control so if you like to use it this would also have solved that problem Personally I prefer to moderate speed manually but I also prefer standard transmission just a control freak I guess There was no noticeable difference in feel between 50 and 80 mph and occasionally and briefly up to 95 the ride stayed smooth and the noise level it was always a little loud but conversation was still possible between front and back seats with a little raising of the voice remained the same This was sometimes a bit of a problem when I would glance down and notice that I was going 85 without meaning to but once I learned to keep a close eye on the speedometer I could only admire the smooth way it handled high speeds This is partly due to the fact that the back seats are bucket seats and are placed about six inches away from the inside wall of the car normally I like to lean against the door with a pillow to sleep in a vehicle but this was impossible in the Windstar We didnt not_have not_a not_whole not_lot not_of not_use not_for not_it but it would probably be handy for those with lively squirming children I should mention that this vehicle has a sliding door on each side providing access to the back seats rather than the usual right side only door Out on the highway it took a little while to get up to cruising speed probably about average pickup for a large vehicle although I dont not_have not_much not_to not_compare not_it not_with not_and not_lost not_a not_little not_speed not_when not_going not_up not_hills but when cruising on a flat road it performed admirably The automobile chosen was the 2001 Ford Windstar and having now spent a total of 34 hours driving and riding in the vehicle through sun rain and fog at all hours of the day and night I have prepared a brief sketch detailing my thoughts After all I might as well have something to show for my absence from epinions right The little city driving I did was unremarkable I mostly noticed that I was more uncomfortable with the vehicle in town because with more other cars closer to me the size of it became more noticeable and I am not not_used not_to not_driving not_a not_large not_car but it handled smoothly and braked well I am always interested in brakes and since I managed not not_to not_sideswipe not_anyone not_I not_consider not_the not_adventure not_a not_success We didnt not_really not_do not_a not_stringent not_test not_of not_this not_function not_since not_everyone but me was agreed on a cool temperature but at one point we did try warming the back for those people trying to sleep while keeping the front cool to maintain alertness in the driver and it seemed to work I obviously cannot not_speak not_to not_any not_issues not_that not_might not_arise not_as not_the not_vehicle not_gets not_to not_be not_a not_few not_years not_older We had no mechanical problems but it would have been surprising if we had since the car was practically brand new and rented to boot and there could be age related problems down the line that we will never know about I cannot not_give not_a not_recommendation not_on not_whether not_to not_buy not_or not_not not_buy not_based not_on not_my not_experience not_but not_I not_can not_offer not_advice not_to not_anyone not_considering not_renting not_a not_vehicle not_to not_haul not_a not_bunch not_of not_stuff not_or not_several not_people Due to a combination of circumstances with which I will not not_bore not_my not_busy not_audience it was recently necessary that I make a trip from Boston MA to Atlanta GA and back a journey of some 1000 odd miles each way Due to the amount of luggage that needed to make the trip as well flying was prohibitively expensive and due to that same quantity of luggage none of the cars owned by the four parties involved were large enough so the decision was made to rent a minivan It does take rather wide turns and turning feels a little tricky at high speeds but then no matter what you re driving you should be careful around turns at 80 mph but otherwise the handling at highway speeds was very nice I did find that I had a tendency to drift a little to the right although this may be my own fault rather than anything to do with the car and there is a marked blind spot on the right side but the car was always responsive and I never felt in danger of losing control As a passenger I must first note that I found the rear seats which are pretty comfortable for basic sitting a little firm but not not_unpleasantly not_so to be almost impossible to sleep on Since we were taking turns with the driving and going straight through a 14 hour trip after not not_having not_slept not_a not_whole not_lot not_the not_night not_before not_this not_distance not_is not_from not_CT not_to not_Atlanta we rested after the three hour trip from Boston to CT it would have been very helpful if the drivers to be could have gotten some sleep while waiting for their shifts but this was extremely difficult This may seem minor but I considered it a serious flaw due to the situation on the return trip we left at 9 30 pm and drove all night so comfortable seats for sleeping would definitely have been helpful For those who do not not_anticipate not_spending not_a not_lot not_of not_time not_sleeping not_in not_the not_back not_seat not_this may not not_be not_much not_of not_an not_issue but if you are ever considering renting one for a trip as we did I would say that this factor definitely warrants consideration as all four of us had a lot of trouble getting any rest while on the road This remained true even in pouring rain Aside from sometimes speeding like a maniac I am a cautious driver and tend to be wary of wet roads but I felt firmly in control of the Windstar after reducing speed a little to about 60 mph even in the middle of a downpour Changing lanes was a little nerve wracking at first when moving to the left since the side of the vehicle is so long but once you get used to it there should be no problem Likewise backing up was a challenge since I wasnt not_used not_to not_looking not_through not_such not_a not_long not_interior not_to not_the not_rear not_window and parking was interesting but these are all issues that would quickly be resolved if I had time to get really accustomed to driving a larger vehicle That advice would be go for it if you re not not_planning not_to not_need not_sleep but if you re going to be in it for the long haul I would seriously suggest looking for something with more comfortable seats I would give the Windstar 4 stars in general for speediness control carrying capacity and gas mileage but due to the unpleasant experience with the seats I can only give it three Again this may seem a small issue but all four of us agreed that the inability to sleep in the seats was a problem on the long drive and I personally would think twice before renting another Windstar for any extensive trip Otherwise I have no fault to find with the vehicle which performed admirably in the few days we had it And since I can think of no more to say here ends my song of the rented Windstar The firm seats dont not_really not_yield not_well not_to not_any not_position not_other not_than not_sitting not_upright not_so not_any not_sort not_of not_slouching not_or not_leaning not_in not_an not_attempt not_to not_nod not_off is not not_welcomed not_by not_the not_car not_I not_should not_note not_that not_the not_vehicle not_has not_a not_removable not_second not_back not_seat

napping than the two rear bucket seats we had The front seats are easily adjustable to a wide range of angles handy since three people of varying heights were taking turns at driving and the rear

Pos,This was a good sign This helps on big trips The front and the back are on two different temperature controls Their back seat folds into the bottom of the floor board One for the front and one for the back Of course after the vehicle has come to a full and complete stop That is why the Mazda MVP is better in that department While we were sitting in the parking lot the van quickly got warm Take your time and remember to have your vehicle checked by a good mechanic So when we popped into this vehicle the sales guy gave us the key and started the engine That is a nice feature that I hope becomes a standard next on all minivans If you need to you or your passenger can pop into the back without getting out of the vehicle The front passengers can decide the temperature for the whole crew or give the control to whoever is sitting in the back The darker the car the faster it will heat up in the hot hot sun 5 Test drive as many cars as you can stand There are a lot of lemons out there and you have to be careful with whatever car you purchase The seats are incredible After owning a Jetta VW and Mazda 626 for what seems like forever we love these seats You the driver will always have the main control 4 Try to get a light as possible colored car if you live like us in the south So out we went test driving everything under the sun until we came across a bright red Ford Windstar 2001 minivan I do mean Bright RED Two doors Need I say more I am not not_quite not_sure not_how not_without not_getting not_into not_the not_minivan not_I not_would not_buckle not_in not_2 not_children not_with not_only not_1 not_door If you are ready to plunge into the family minivan make sure you get a minivan with at least these options 1 Power windows for the front and the back Since our family has multiplied from 2 to 3 we knew it was time to drive a car that could carry all of our stuff But if and when you need to get out the interior lights can be switched to the sleeping baby mode so that only the floor lights will light up As far as removing seats At first I was not not_crazy not_about not_the not_color but since we live in a town with a bunch of crazy drivers at least they cant not_miss not_us not_pulling not_out not_It not_was not_a not_cold not_yucky not_day We cant not_wait not_for not_our not_next not_big not_trip not_from not_South not_Carolina not_to not_Ohio not_or not_Florida not_My not_friend not_just not_bought not_a not_Ford not_Explorer and after her last long trip she is ready to trade it in and get a Windstar My husband does that He says that they are heavy and we are not not_quite not_sure not_where not_we not_would not_store not_them not_if not_we not_have not_to not_remove not_them not_while not_we not_were not_away not_from not_home So on hot days you can open the back windows to let the hot air escape and close to keep in the air conditioning 2 Dark tinted windows to keep some of hot sun out and childrens goofy offending faces in 3 Two control panels for the temperature controls She loves to ride in it and so do all of the neighborhood kids I still cant not_get not_over not_how not_roomy not_this not_minivan not_is not_When not_you not_are not_in not_the not_vehicle not_you not_feel not_like not_you not_can not_stretch not_out not_and not_really not_enjoy not_the not_ride
Pos,The price also was very reasonable and with the trade in on my Grand Am and the cash bonus my final price was just under 10 000 00 I recently purchased a 2003 Ford ZX2 and even though I have only had the vehicle for about a month I am very happy with its performance The reason for choosing this vehicle was after my wife had read the consumer report on the vehicle we felt that safety was an important feature and this car seemed to be just that The car has a very sporty look to it and the size is just right for a smaller family As far as the safety I spoke of earlier the vehicle seems to be built very solid and that was very important to me If you are like me you read all you can on something before you spend a numerous amount of money so even though I have only had this vehicle a month I am very pleased to say I am happy with my purchase In this day of high gas prices this was another reason for my choice My ZX2 is a 4 cylinder but I was very surprised with the power it still has Going up hill does not not_seem not_to not_be not_a not_problem not_for not_this not_car and the smooth ride for the size is just right for me After checking gas mileage around town I am averaging about 26 miles to the gallon I live in an area with many hills and with that type of mileage I was very pleased
Pos,This thing hauls Wow what a blast This car is worth waiting for If you really want this car be patient The 2002 T bird is obviously a car engineered with passion My advice remains the same though Dont pay a big mark up on the vehicle It finally arrived I waited nine months for Ford to fill my order for a 2002 T bird So I ordered mine from a Florida dealer had them ship it to me and paid very close to sticker From the powerful motor and firm suspension right down to the chrome trimmed cup holders this is a car that exudes style and quality There is not not_The not_trunk not_is not_surprisingly not_spacious not_I not_havent not_put not_my not_clubs not_in not_it not_yet but I dont not_anticipate not_a not_problem This car is a thing of beauty A bit of advice California dealers were marking up the T birds 10 000 15 000 depending on the color This really is a two seater though Its a good size car so many people assume that there must be a small seat or shelf hidden back there It was love at first sight and at first drive im someone who does not not_know not_a not_lot not_about not_mechanics but is impressed by detail and design Though the trunk is small I regularly cart around two sets of golf clubs ive driven the car three hundred miles in a single day and found it comfortable My father who owned one of the 57s that inspired the 2002 recently told me Everyone should own a car like this once in their life Its true If you are worried about room inside dont not_be not_im not_6 not_1 and the car is comfortable and fun with or without the hard top on It is even more fun without the top of course The younger skateboarding crowd often yell cool car when I drive by and I wonder if they even know that this car is based on a 1950s style Six months after my purchase I still strongly recommend this vehicle The low center of gravity and wide tires also makes for nice cornering What is really interesting is how people react to this piece of new Americana Older folks remember the 50s T birds and are happy to see its back What is surprising is that the tight suspension and responsive V 8 do give the driver a real thrill Its all the performance I could possibly use in a car and im not not_gentle not_with not_the not_gas when I drive a car They all get built at the same factory so check around the country for the dealer willing to give you the best price October update to this review ive got a couple of thousand miles on the T bird now really driven this car Its better than ever No regrets on this purchase They are out there and you can ship a car across country for a couple hundred bucks I had mine built at Ford from and order placed by a Florida dealer and then shipped to a fleet center in Dublin California I never met the salesman I bought the car from but then again I didnt not_pay not_the not_6 not_000 not_mark not_up not_my not_local not_dealer not_wanted not_to not_charge not_me not_Be not_patient The sound system is just amazing Now that it is broken in it sounds just fantastic I actually prefer listening to CDs in the car rather than my home theater system Lessons learned carry sunscreen in the car and a leather jacket in the trunk and its almost never necessary to put up the top Now that the engine has a few thousand miles on it I drive the car more aggressively This car drives nearly silent with the optional hard top on Take the hard top off and it is still very quiet inside even at highway speeds Conversation is easy though the fantastic Bose stereo system with CD changer may have you cranking up the tunes Ford makes a big point of saying that this car is a cruiser and not not_intended not_to not_be not_a not_Porshe not_like not_sports not_car not_Its not_a not_car not_to not_drive not_around not_town not_in not_and not_a not_car not_to not_enjoy not_a not_road not_trip
Pos,My husband loves Jaguars A plan aah yes the limiting factor The interior is black leather Appearance I Outside The backseat and cargo areas are also quite nice The piece de resistance of the dash area is the silver temperature audio console The black leather seats are quite nice both looks wise and in comfort The cargo area is roomy with plenty of headspace for tall objects The simulated leather trim on the dash however does not not_uphold not_the not_luxury not_car not_appearance The inside of the Limited Escape has a much more luxurious feel than the outside The Escape is not not_an not_ugly not_small not_SUV but its overall outward appearance is rather boxy by my standards This can be rolled up when not in use and even removed entirely This essentially allows you to have 4WD on all the time without the excess fuel consumption One nice feature is the press able garage door opener holder that sits above the rear view mirror It contrasts nicely with the black surface covering and greatly adds to the 147luxury 148 feel of the car The glove box and armrest console are quite roomy and there is some storage built in for CD cases It feels quite roomy and the front passenger seating area seems to have as much space as the larger Explorer There is also a stylish roll up style cover which can be pulled over low lying objects for privacy There is of course also the option of putting it in full time 4WD presumably better for snowy or slippery conditions Overall the car feels quite stable I always feel like it is in control with no fear of swaying or tipping This little truck has a nice 147auto 148 feature which enables the car to switch power to whichever wheel needs it most There are 2 potentially useful bins underneath the audio console one with an extra power jack and 2 good sized cupholders one of which holds a removable ashtray And so we ended up at the Ford Escape The Car My new Escape is a brand new 2003 4WD Limited model with BOTH available options of the power moonroof and the trailer towing package The pockets on the back of the front seats look to be quite useful for children 146s accessories and the rear seat headrests are a nice and not not_often not_seen feature This would give you room for a cell phone sunglasses and some change but looks prone to collecting semi useless junk that wont quite stay in place So we set off on a quest for a car that fit our bill of needs sporty stylish a luxurious feel and not not_at not_all not_in not_the not_least not_coverage not_by not_Ford not_146s He has a current lease on ans type has been to tour their factories in England and has numerable collectables and trinkets adorning our home tantamount to his love of this legendary car In addition all Escapes have a rather high square hind end This adds to the boxy appearance but does mean more storage space in the cargo area so it is an equitable trade off Inside This comfort tested out for both the side and middle seats so there should be minimal fussing over which child goes where As far as storage areas go this car offers plenty This model Escape comes complete with a 4 liter V6 engine I chose the silver color more on my husband 146s insistance than anything else I would have preferred black for a sleeker look It may just make a perfect match for someone who needs extra space for children and accompanying accessories but who does not not_want not_to not_give not_up not_owning not_a not_luxury not_car not_POST not_NOTE While this review is on a 2003 Escape for some reason Epinions did not not_offer not_2003 not_as not_an not_option not_in not_the not_model not_year drop down window Fear not not_it not_is not_not not_a not_review not_of not_a not_2002 not_car The car has some nice driving features my favorite of which is the 4WD I am used to the 3 option 4WD off low or high with appropriate measures needed to switch from one to the other It has a nice upscale feel to it and it drives quite nicely forming a near perfect hybrid of car and truck I think it makes a nice alternative to both the unimaginative mini van and the fuel guzzling true trucks or SUV This takes up most of the middle area of the front dash and is complete with 6 CD in dash changer tuner air temperature controls and vents and storage pockets some of which seem more useful than others It feels like a quality ride Synposis I am quite happy with my new little Escape I will gingerly classify it as a 147luxury 148 SUV because in the Limited model it has the finest equipment one could want in a utility vehicle It is too grainy and puckered in some places I don 146t know what would have worked better since real leather or wood probably would have put the car outside of its price class perhaps a simulated wood could have done the trick Nor does this count the numerous times we had to take it in for minor repairs I wont go into detail of our woes now that will be for another review but suffice it to say I was ready for something with a little more reliability The driver controls panel is somewhat stylish by day the round white windows look rather futuristic but the effect is ruined at night Rather than continuing to glow their opalescent white they turn black with illuminated dials and numbers in the oh so christmasy green and red Personally I think the white 147 glow bug 148 look is much nicer and some neon blue dials would have completed the look nicely Well with the disclaimer in place here goes I am a truck driver by nature having graduated to my Escape from a Ford Ranger Splash and I was unsure of how I would like the 147car chassy 148 feel of the Escape Well I like it I can 146t say that it drives like my truck but it does have a similar feel including the better visibility that comes with the extra height This is compounded by the lack of plastic 147fenders 148 on the Limited model which are a distinguishing identifier of the XLT and XLS models Apparantly Ford thinks that a monotone body looks more stylish and 147upperclass 148 but I think the black edging gives the bottom of the car a finished look I don 146t know how this will translate into long term preservation of the car 146s finish but I expect the bottom of the car may show more dings and scratches and be more prone to rust The car has a nice amount of pick up but it does take some time to switch gears about 2 seconds after I think it should have which can be slightly disconcerting Once going the car cruises along quite happily without any feel of a struggle I have read in some reviews that there is excessive wind noise however I did not not_find not_this not_to not_be not_the not_case not_Perhaps not_it not_is not_because not_I not_am not_used not_to not_trucks not_which not_tend not_to not_be not_louder not_than not_cars So why am I writing about a Ford Escape Because it took a will and determination equal to his passion to convince him NOT to renew his lease on another Jaguar OK all you fellow jag nuts can come assassinate me now but at least hear me out first Ours type was riddled with problems and has had no less than THREE major 147hospital 148 visits in the two years it has lived with us and this does not not_count not_the not_time not_I not_had not_a not_teeny not_tiny not_little not_scrape not_up and had to have the rear bumper replaced 133oops The rear cargo area as stated before also seems quite useful and the rear seats fold down to allow for oversized objects I Practicality Well the guts of this review should be how well this car works and drives and here it is although I can 146t promise this will show off my reviewing ability to its finest I am not not_a not_car not_connoisseur and I know little about the mechanical innards that make them go I am writing this from the point of view of your average driver not not_an not_expert not_on not_the not_subject not_by not_any not_means Why make the gear shift handle block the view of the gear shift indicator Being a new car I don 146t yet have a good feel of where drive neutral etc are and it is quite disconcerting to have to move my head around to see what gear I have shifted too I am sure this is something that will come to bother me less in time as I develop a feel for the car but right now it is an irritating testament to Ford quality or not not_The not_backseat is also quite roomy and comfortable even for a full size adult which I am not not_measuring not_in not_at not_a not_mere not_5 not_ft not_tall but even my husband had room to move his feet around The entire interior has a uniform feel with its black leather seating and dash surfaces and black plush carpeting covering the floors mats cargo area and front face of rear seats and the tinted windows and moonroof complete the mood lit effect of being in a dark car Functionality I Comfort Sitting in this car is quite nice the driver seat is fully adjustable in so many ways it would be hard not not_to not_find not_a not_good not_fit not_One not_thing not_I not_don not_146t not_understand not_is not_why not_there not_are not_no not_power not_controls not_on not_the not_passenger not_side not_seat and why the power controls don 146t extend to the lumbar support and seat tilt on the driver side Really if you 146re going to go power please just go all the way However all power controls are close at hand including those to the windows and moonroof and one touch butt warmers so nice and this ease of use extends to the space age silver temp audio console Everything is within reach and self explanatory no muddling about with buttons trying to figure out what does which One control which is not not_in not_the not_best not_location is the all too important GEAR SHIFT Come on guys
Pos,You ll be so happy with this vehicle The 2 tone leather seating is elegant and upscale the storage pods are plenty and the leg room for driver and passenger belies its size Yes indeed this compact SUV is a gentle ride with superb responsive handling Braking is smooth and crisp and the 16 inch wheels are very nice The exterior looks are clean sporty and have a touch of elegance especially with the 2 tone grey lower body moulding The Mach stereo is quite bold and the 6 CD changer is handy to have saves me from fishing around in the center console for another disc On the down side as I glance over my left shoulder in preparation for a lane change the visual is not not_clear and folding down the rear seats is more complicated than it should be The gear shift lever is too long and sometimes gets in the way of the nicely placed instrument panel The sun roof is easy to operate and an option with every penny when you can smell the sweet breeze Initially I wasnt not_wild not_about not_the not_color not_of not_my not_Escape not_red not_but not_its not_really not_more not_of not_a not_rich not_ruby and ive received a ton of compliments on the hue Mostly though I appreciate the safety factors such as the front and side air bags and the ABS braking capabilities The fabled wind noise problem is corrected for me by rolling up windows Folks im a long time GMC Jimmy owner and I was skeptical of a Ford product Believe me my initial resistance has been replaced by cheerleading for this frisky sporty sophisticated SUV Additionally almost all of the sites I visited through various search engines raved about the Escape More importantly owners of Escapes did too I can recommend the 2003 Ford Escape XLT Premium without qualification
Pos,It corners fairly well for a pickup truck The truck boasts a top speed of about 102MPH The 5 gear automatic transmissions shifting is almost unnoticeable even under heavy acceleration It also has good mid level acceleration from 35 to 65 MPH There is plenty of room for a great deal of cargo back there And loading and unloading is a snap The space within the extended portion of the cab is made super accessible by the two fold out doors on either side It is hard for me to imagine 2 grown adults being able to sit on the tiny fold down seats provided in the extended cab These doors are very well hidden so well hidden in fact it took me 2 days to realize my new truck was actually a 4 door It is also equipped with an overdrive switch to limit the transmission to the 4 base gears for those up and down back road trips we all love so much Through town the ride is a little bumpy but it is a pickup truck Considering its center of gravity is a little higher than the standard models because of the 235 tires The 4 0L V6 provides plenty of power decent acceleration as well as a good amount of torque I get about 17 Miles to the gallon on the Highway thats traveling between 75 and 85 MPH The interior of the truck is well laid out The 60 40 split front seat is quite comfortable and the center fold up Arm Rest tape holder CD holder Change holder is also a very nice feature Although the cab is pretty roomy The cast aluminum deep dish wheels look very sharp on this truck Another nice feature is the Vacuum Lock 4X4 switching which allows the truck to be switched from 2w high to 4w high and back to 2w high at almost any speed I bought this truck new had 800 Miles on it thats new in my book about 2 weeks ago Although I have only had it for a short time I find the ride very enjoyable on the highway as well as through town My advice for someone thinking of purchasing one of these trucks is to go with the Extended Cab 4x4 with the 4 0L V6 I have heard from many that the 3 0L V6 and the 2 5L 4 are both under powered for this truck Besides bigger is usually better Once I have had this truck a little longer and have more info about the reliability I will write some more reviews on it I am also planning on making some modifications on this truck which I will also share with you all
Pos,The bed is plenty big enough for all of my bands equipment Theres more than enough power to haul it all around the southeastern US Three of them took my recomendation and are now as happy as I am with it That said I must tell you that the 1999 Ford Ranger extended cab is the perfect vehicle for a young musician such as myself The cab is quite roomy and the four door option makes it easy to lure 16 year old girls into it The stereo is great mine came with cassette and cd players Id have trouble parking a 4x4 pickup not not_so Even though its big enough to haul anything I could put in it its small enough to park anywhere ive recomended this truck to all of my friends First let me say that as a rock star I object to the stereotypical view of people who own pickup trucks as rednecks I am on the cutting edge of music and fashion and ive never owned a pair of boots in my life The outside appearance is sport enough to say hey ive got style but humble enough to not not_attract not_too not_much not_attention not_I not_got not_the not_step not_side not_model not_which not_I not_think not_looks not_really not_cool not_almost not_as not_sexy not_as not_me not_Living not_in not_an not_urban not_area not_you not_d not_think
Pos,The ride is incredibly smooth and it has all the comforts of home Id only driven Chevy products until recently I considered myself a die hard Chevy person The SuperCab is helpful as well as my mother has 3 children still at home Id freak out having to drive a truck Not at all I highly recommend this truck for anyone who wants a fun handy little truck If you re looking for a manly truck this isnt not_for not_you not_Its not_definitely not_more not_accomodating not_with not_easy not_to not_use not_features not_and not_lots not_of not_gadgets Id never thought myself to be a truck girl but I fell in love with this Ranger Its a 1999 Cherry Red Ranger fully loaded with CD player electric everything etc Then my mom got a new Ford Ranger SuperCab I went to New York to visit her and wound up having to drive her truck while I was there I mean she really had to twist my arm I was pretty astounded She drove from Illinois to New York with 2 adults and 2 children all of their stuff and my new living room set with no problems no cramping etc Plus its still stylish and fun to drive I took it off roading on the back roads in upstate New York and it has quite of bit of pick up and go With all of its power and superior handling I still wasnt not_overwhelmed not_im not_5 not_3 not_and not_weigh not_110 not_lbs not_on not_a not_good not_day not_so not_needless not_to not_say not_im not_used not_to not_driving not_really not_little not_cars not_Chevy not_Cavalier not_so not_I not_thought
Pos,I recommend this vehicle for its safety as well as its comfort My husband and I liked it so much after we traded it the first time we went back to Ford and got the same truck back The only downfall on this truck is that if you have more than one child who is ultimately going to grow up quicker than you can imagine then you will need to get the king cab I have two children and as they grow older it is getting a bit crowded in the truck Other than that it is a wonderful truck It stands up much better than the other models as far as breakdowns and best built A few months ago I backed into a dodge which my husband wasnt not_very not_thrilled not_with but the Ford never even got a scratch on it The dodge on the other hand was so weakly built that it just dented immediately Even my insurance agent was shocked Not a scrap on it So if you re looking for reliable and durable the Ford F150 XL is the way to go
Pos,The paper thin doors Thats my only gripe about Toyota Only once on the beach has it felt a little squirrely One thing ive never really liked about Chevy is that they have never impressed me as a working truck Thats what I did and it put me in the seat of the Ranger and firmly planted in my mind that my next truck will be a Ranger too As far as Chevy goes close but not not_quite not_Chevy seems to have a decent product but I think that if you are going to go for a Chevy make it a full size They just seem to give way and start to feel a little shaky after a few years of semi hard driving Id hate to see how they fare in real difficult terrain Another minus But we survived intact I still believe that a truck is a truck and you are never going to get loyalists to change their views on which is best im glad I did though I guess my ultimate advice is this If you want to buy a truck go to every brand dealer and drive them all full size and smaller versions OK a little background on myself ive owned two Toyota 4wd pickups one was an ExtraCab one wasnt not_ive not_owned not_full not_size not_GMCs not_and not_Fords and ive driven just about all of the small pick up class brands Second let me give my disclaimer Having owned a few pick ups in my life and knowing the loyalties that come with pick up ownership I am not not_about not_to not_force not_my not_preference not_on not_anyone They always seemed too street for me On to Ford Despite having had on of the closest to pleasant experiences ive ever had at a dealership the Ranger just worked for me Solid doors and tailgate the windows closed tightly and the engine and transmission worked and still work like they should I purchased the 3 0 V6 and so far have had no problems Semi frequent obstacles have required me to utilize the shift on the fly 4WD which has worked like a charm However I can honestly say that without any hesitation that I have never been happier with the truck I am driving today I bought my 2000 Ford Ranger in March of 2000 The Ford dealership was the last place I went only after combing the Toyota Nissan and Chevy lots Nissan went out the window after about ten minutes Despite the weird looks of their entry into the smaller truck market the salesman had the ability to annoy me right off the lot that excite cha hey buddy that excite cha whatever Nissan Anyway Toyota almost had me ive been a fan of Toyotas for awhile and would still recommend them to anyone that had the money and didnt not_mind not_having not_to not_buy not_a not_new not_truck not_every not_few not_years
Pos,im currently leasing a brand new 2000 Ford Ranger Truck Its a 4 wheel drive with a V 6 engine It rides pretty smooth and it came with all the accessories and I do mean ALL I love the CD player It also has a step on the side to get up into the the pick up area if you are carrying something in back Also it doesnt get good gas mileage and I drive a lot for my job THeres also this annoying sound when you dont not_buckle not_your not_seat not_belt not_right not_away It would be great for moving big furniture I find it hard to get back into the extended cab area however to store things I miss my trunk It will ding about ten times very fast and if you still dont not_put not_your not_seat not_belt not_on not_it not_will not_continue not_to not_do not_this not_every not_minute not_O not_K not_Already not_Anyway not_so not_far it has turned out to be a nice little truck for me This is my first truck and it wasnt not_my not_first not_choice not_Money not_was not_a not_factor not_since not_I not_still not_owed not_on not_my not_other not_car not_and not_trucks not_depreciate not_less not_ive not_been not_told not_All not_in not_all not_I not_like not_it not_Besides not_the not_accessories not_I not_like not_the not_fact not_that not_I not_sit not_high not_up not_and not_the not_4 not_wheel not_drive not_will not_come not_in not_handy not_in not_the not_snow not_I not_live not_in not_Minnesota
Pos,I bought my 1991 Ford Taurus L Wagon from a local used car lot in really good condition The rear wiper motor and rear defroster stopped working I ended up re charging the AC retrofitted and replacing the thermostat water pump radiator the original one cracked and exploded could have caused serious injury both front motor mounts and a battery Though we replaced a lot of stuff we live in the mountains in NC and put about 20 000 miles a year on it and I was very impressed with how this 10 year old car took the stresses of everyday climbing hills and pulling a lot of weight with its front wheel drive I sold this wagon to get a 92 Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser Check out that review later It said 71 XXX on the five digit odometer so there was no telling how many miles was on it I needed to have a car and I always admired the Ford Taurus Wagons I took it on a test drive and fell in love with the handling and with some of the features I purchased the car for 2 000 doing a Buy here Pay here financing Which I later paid it off early and only paid 1 800 for it I took a trip the same day about 50 miles away from my home On my way I ended up getting a speeding ticket for 80mph in a 65 mph I was actually so impressed with the handling and quality of ride I was unaware that I was speeding I was just watching the road I made that trip and back and an extra couple of days on that full tank of gas which impressed me for being a wagon After a while I started noticing the flaws in it I started having problems with the transmission it started lacking Horsepower and the AC started getting warm
Pos,The dashboard is clean and functional And be prepared for a noisy ride My only complaints are the noise and the always vibrating steering wheel So they gave me a Ford Focus from enterprise Exterior The wheelbase is a little longer than a comparable Honda Civic Interior However the steering wheel tended to vibrate a lot over rough pavement The stereo reception isnt not_the not_greatest and the system is sub par overall I recently had to rent a car after a snowy truck accident The new edge styling looks pretty cool Its modern and attractive for a car in my opinion It surprisingly handled pretty well for a car in its class Very European like feel It would have got a 4 star if it wasnt not_for not_that not_annoying not_vibrating not_steering not_wheel not_trust not_me not_it not_vibrates not_like not_crazy The seats are pretty comfortable but lacks in lumbar support and armrest I still found it to be fairly comfortable for everyday driving Driving Experience The instrument panel also has that new modern look and feel to it The stereo and a c settings are pretty easy to use and the buttons are well defined and easy to access The ride is actually pretty comfortable I was pleasantly surprised Its a bit on the firm side and you still feel all the roads irregularities but its a lot better than most cars in its class The one thing that did bother me a bit was the amount of road engine noise ive heard that a comparable Hyundai Elantra does an excellent job of keeping the road engine noise down and that car costs less than a comparable Ford Focus Something for the Ford engineers to shoot for This is a great value and its great fun to drive
Pos,It is almost like having a truck and van in one The seats are removable allowing for even more room for hauling large items We have carried lumber furniture mattresses and even key stones in the back of our Aerostar van The extend area of the Aerostar allows for comfortable and less crowded seating when hauling items One thing I dont not_like not_about not_the not_Aerostar is that when the brakes get wet and you go to use them they are extremely touchy The seats are not not_easily not_removed and it can be necessary to have help in taking them out My Aerostar is currently 8 years old and all I have ever really had to replace is regular wear and tear items ive only had to replace the brakes twice and it is on its second set of tires They are so touchy that everyone is jerked forward when you touch the brakes Usually this only happens during the first couple of times of using them until they dry out It is for these reasons that I still havent had the desire to trade my old Aerostar Van in for a newer and fancier van I value the extended part of the van too much to get a newer one that doesnt offer the extra room in the back I could care less about dual side opening doors remote door openers or less mileage just give me more rear space and im a happy camper I bought my Aerostar Van brand new in 1992 I still drive and enjoy my van to this very day Every time I think about trading it in for a newer vehicle I cant not_think not_of not_anything not_I not_would not_rather not_have not_to not_drive not_I not_bought not_the not_extended not_version not_of not_the not_Aerostar because I wanted and needed the extra space I can get all my groceries in the back the kids toys and necessities when traveling to Grandmas house and when going on a long trip suitcases and everything the kids have to bring along fit nicely in the extend space I just dont not_understand not_how not_people not_who not_have not_regular not_mini not_vans not_fit not_everything not_in not_when not_going not_on not_vacations not_I not_cant not_imagine not_what not_the not_passenger not_area not_looks not_like
Pos,This car is HOT Also thes r has 150 horsepower The car is a very responsive car They are very affordable and very reliable This car is an extremely under rated car This car has an incredible amount of acceleration The seats are very comfortable and provide a very smooth ride This body kit as well as many others dont not_come not_cheap not_DRIVETRAIN This car is available with a 5 speed manual transmission or a 4 speed automatic PLEASE NOTICE THIS IS A REVIEW FOR A 1998 ESCORT ZX2 NOT A STANDARD ESCORT The back doesnt have as much leg room as one would anticipate but the seats are very comfortable The Escort ZX2 is powered by the 2 0 liter 16 valve dual overhead cam ZETEC engine which pumps out 130 horsepower stock The roof is slightly low in the back which makes it slightly difficult for taller people to sit in the back HANDLING If you havent driven a Ford lately maybe you should start with the ZX2 you will be hooked for life It has power windows power moon roof power mirrors alloy wheels rear spoiler 6 disc CD changer memory driver seat intermittent wipers fog lights did i forget anything lol It will quite possibly turn on a dime I dont not_know not_what not_else not_to not_say not_about not_it not_other not_than not_it not_handles not_real not_good not_BRAKING It looks a heck of a lot better I mean when you drive you want something that will turn heads The ZX2 offers a very tasteful sporty lines that are a step up from its Escort Coupe counterpart Honestly I prefer the ZX2 over the Escort Coupe one reason only Inside the ZX2 you will find that there is plenty of room in the front and viewing is excellent from inside the car has solar glass that tints slightly to the sun My 1998 ZX2 comes standard with driver and passenger second generation air bags ABS was an option back in 1998 not not_sure if it still is now but if it isnt not_like not_I not_said not_before This car is a limited edition car that was offered in 1999 and 2000 But with a little bit of money you can get the same performance out of your ZX2 as you can out of thes r possibly maybe more INTERIOR The only disappointing fact is that Ford put a governor at 106 mph on all ZX2 models except thes r models which has an improved cam timing and a speedo cluster that goes up to 150 mph instead of 120 mph like the other models My ZX2 hasnt failed me and I got mine USED with 75000 miles on it I havent had a problem with it yet and hopefully I wont for a long time My ZX2 has about every option offered for the 98 model It was rather scary Fortunately no one was in front of me or in the other lane I would HIGHLY recommend getting ABS brakes as an option if it doesnt come standard I obviously dont not_have not_them not_after not_that not_little not_incident not_SAFETY It would be very beneficial if you do get that My ZX2 is a 1998 Even though this is a review for a 1998 the whole design of the car hasnt been altered between 1998 2002 Maybe the only difference is that Escort was dropped off the rear bumper Just like any car brakes need to be serviced I changed the brakes on my ZX2 as soon as I purchased it So far I cant not_complain not_about not_the not_braking not_except not_I not_did not_experience not_the not_brakes not_locking not_up not_on not_me not_when not_turning not_off not_of not_a not_highway It drives me nuts that magazines dont not_talk not_about not_them not_much if at all I mean for some reason Ford wanted to replace this car with the Focus ZX3 which dont not_get not_me not_wrong is a great car but so is the ZX2 Well enough about how I feel on with the review LOOKS Overall The ZX2 hopefully will do that Also if the factory setup isnt not_everything not_that not_you not_were not_looking not_for not_in not_a not_ZX2 not_there not_are not_plenty

not_kit not_that not_is not_if not_you not_have not_the not_money Just recently early this year I have the opportunity to purchase this fine automobile they call an escort ZX2 I previously owned a Geo Tracker which went completely belly up on me for the fourth time grrr and thought it was time for a new change also being that I desperately needed a car for spring break and fast I didnt not_waste not_any not_time not_to not_go not_to not_the not_town not_car not_dealership and I checked out their used car lot They had plenty of cars there but I had my eye on one car in particular and that was the ZX2 I was able to purchase this car remarkably for 3000 I have been a proud owner ever since and I have had all kinds of crazy ideas on what to do to it next Hopefully eventually I plan on putting a subtle body kit that will bring the lines of the car out a little more
Pos,One of my favorite parts of the design is the wide wheelbase which allows for excellent handling It doesnt corner like a BMW but you dont not_pay not_what not_you not_would not_for not_a not_true not_sports not_car And if you like loud music while you drive the optional premium sound package with the CD changer is worth the money It seems to have all the power you really need but it isnt not_a not_gas not_hog not_with not_just not_a not_four not_cylinder not_engine The first car I ever had was a 1981 Ford Escort and the first new car I bought was a 1998 Escort ZX2 But the fact is the ZX2 is an affordable new car I thinks its the best car on the market for less than 15 000 The only similarity between the two vehicles is the name and thats not not_a not_bad not_thing not_Unlike not_the not_underpowered not_Escort not_of not_old not_with not_the not_paper not_thin not_doors not_the not_ZX2 not_feels not_like not_a not_car not_that not_isnt not_at not_the not_bottom not_of not_the not_new not_car not_price not_level In short this is a fine car for anyone who wants a fun reliable car that wont make their insurance go way up One warning This is not not_the not_perfect not_car not_for not_those not_with not_young not_children not_Getting not_a not_car not_seat not_from not_the not_back not_would not_not not_be not_an not_easy not_chore In fact it can be well below 15 grand if you can live without the spoiler and automatic transmission Its more fun to drive with the manual transmission anyway After putting 43 000 miles on my ZX2 without a trip to the mechanic I have to say im thrilled with the car
Pos,Why did I buy this vehicle It is designed for the highway not not_the not_speedway You can feel the difference when driving a Contour Who shouldnt not_buy not_this not_car not_hot not_rodders not_like not_I not_said not_before not_this not_car not_is not_for not_the not_highway not_not not_the not_speedway Who should buy this car college students reliability commuters great freeway car families on a limited budget has all the basic necessities of a quality car at a price us poor folk can afford Having the efficiency of an economy car the room of a family car and a car that can climb the Siskiyou mountains very steep in fifth gear leaves me completely pleased with this car It may sound corny but I can honestly say that I do not not_have not_one not_complaint not_about not_this not_car not_considering not_the not_low not_price not_I not_paid not_for not_it not_approximately not_12800 not_and not_only not_0 not_9 not_interest When you test drive this vehicle it will probably feel less swift than it actually is This is because it is designed to be a commuter car and it is unusually high geared My previous car was having problems I needed a reliable car because I commuted to a college 27 miles away I went shopping for used cars but the dealership in my hometown in Northern California offered 0 9 financing on all 1998 Ford Escorts to buyers with good credit I test drove the car liked it and decided to buy it With the 0 9 financing I got a brand new car for the same price that I could have bought a 7 or 8 thousand dollar used car A new car was perfect for me because I needed something reliable I love driving a car that gets 35 miles to the gallon seats for comfortably and can keep up with the two seaters
Pos,This car drives like a dream If you are taller im 5 4 you probably will feel cramped in this car It accelerates quickly hugs corners and has lots of zip for a four cylinder engine It has quite a bit of trunk space for a coupe and the back seats are pretty spacious It is a perfect fit for me I dont not_have not_to not_scoot not_the not_seat not_forward not_much not_to not_reach not_the not_pedals not_which not_I not_do not_for not_most not_other not_vehicles The fully loaded ZX2 came with some pretty neat stuff like CD ABS moon roof air conditioning power door locks windows and remote keyless entry I couldnt afford those extras but its nice to know I could have had them The one noticeable lack was the absence of cruise control For long trips the seats are comfy the stereo is decent but no cruise control is a drag I highly recommend this car for commuters or for mostly in town driving For long trips though the gas mileage is great The 1998 Escort ZX2 was my first car purchase I shopped around all of summer 1998 and bought the Escort in August I bought it for three reasons price looks and handling Price I bought it for 9998 with pretty much no features radio rear window defroster ive been following the used car market and ive noticed its kept its value exceptionally well Looks I bought the denim blue model I really love the sleek lines and low slung look of this car Handling
Pos,Thanks He loves his little car My husband owns a 1998 Ford Escort ZX2 The gas mileage is good for a sports car We usually get around 35 city 45 highway At first we bought this car because of the low price The downfalls are the lack of head room and the loud running engine The things I love about this car is the quick acceleration and sporty look He always talks about it and talks of how people compliment him on the look of the car As we began to drive it more often we decided we liked it better than cars we ve owned in the past It is nice to drive this vehicle around town because of how fast it will get up and go It is easy to pass slow drivers and make that yellow light I think this car would be best for the teenagers
Pos,The escort went without a problem That to me was a plus The car handles very well in the winter I live close to the snow belt here in Michigan so I need something dependable We have for the first snow falls this year parked a 4x4 truck we own and drove the escort solely since the truck was all over the road If you are a smoker sadly you must pay an extra charge for an ashtray the size of a tennis ball and only one per vehicle The things I can say I tend to hate about the vehicle is that you can only have three beverages in the car with only three cup holders That are also small and the two front ones are too close to the dash so only short cups will fit Sitting in the back seat is uncomfortable if you have a tall person sitting in front The bigger vehicles just dont not_make not_me not_feel not_as not_safe not_as not_driving not_smaller not_vehicles not_I not_feel not_as not_though not_I not_have not_more not_control not_over not_my not_actions not_and not_I not_have not_found not_this not_particularly not_comforting not_with not_this not_vehicle The seats crack and creek when a heavier set person sits in front so I feel as though they arent built as solidly Overall I would say this is a very economical vehicle worth the money if you are looking for something mechanically well built Unfortunately for the taller and well built man this would not not_be not_the not_type not_vehicle not_to not_own It is comfortable unless you go on a very lengthy trip then the driver side seat tends to get uncomfortable After driving the vehicle to work for quite sometime I found it was very good on gas I drive an estimated 25 miles to work 6 days a week so on an average I drive 300 miles a week and fill my gas tank once When I went out looking for a vehicle I had the price and how long the car would last in mind Price was comparable with other makes and models so I checked on the length of time it would last People I had talked to who owned them had nothing but good things to say about the long lasting motor and body
Pos,I bought the car because my dad bought the first escort back in 84 and i wanted to be like dad I waited till there was an escort worthy of a by from me and im not not_just not_bragging not_because not_I not_own not_one not_it not_is not_one not_of not_the not_most not_reliable not_cars not_on not_the not_market not_I not_didnt not_just not_go not_out not_and not_buy not_it not_because not_it not_was not_a not_ford not_and not_I not_looked not_at not_the not_market not_and not_it not_really not_was not_the not_best not_in not_power not_and not_in not_gas not_mileage not_and not_in not_over not_all not_performance not_I not_would not_give not_this not_car not_an not_11 not_out not_of not_10 not_on not_looks not_and not_handing not_well not_as not_for not_theft not_protecting not_i not_does not_have not_some not_flaws not_there not_mine not_was not_stolen not_twice not_from not_me not_in not_the not_state not_of not_Tennessee not_and not_i not_was not_lucky not_to not_be not_able not_to not_say not_I not_have not_the not_car not_in not_my not_hands not_once not_more not_mine not_is not_green not_in not_color not_and not_use not_to not_have not_five not_spoke not_14 not_rims not_but not_i not_have not_to not_replace not_them not_all not_I not_would not_recommend not_for not_every not_one not_to not_get not_steel not_rims not_for not_your not_escort
Pos,It is a beautiful Sable Green color and is a very attractive wagon Also have a roof rack for any extras I love this wagon It has plenty of power speeds along especially on the highway where I do most of my driving If you would be in the market for a wagon check these out I am just disappointed that they dont not_make not_these not_anymore Of course it has roll down windows but that is one less thing that can go wrong when you have the electric ones I recently purchased a 1998 Ford Escort Station Wagon I cant not_tell not_you not_how not_much not_I not_love not_it not_I not_drive not_almost not_70 not_miles not_per not_day not_5 not_days not_a not_week That car just keeps going and going I am getting roughly 32 miles to the gallon so I certainly cant not_complain not_about not_that not_The not_interior not_is not_comfortable not_almost not_like not_a not_luxury not_car The brakes are power which I prefer not not_the not_ABS not_which not_I not_cant not_seem not_to not_get not_used not_to not_when not_I not_drive not_my not_husbands not_car not_All not_in not_all not_I not_am not_very not_pleased not_with not_this not_car There is plenty of room for all the people you want to bring along the dog cats luggage anything that you want to go with you The maintenance on this car is virtually non existent The tires are the kind where you can buy them most anywhere in stock and they are not not_that not_expensive not_I not_have not_AC not_a not_really not_good not_stereo not_system not_rear not_wiper not_and not_sprayer not_keyless not_entry not_on not_the not_back not_and not_the not_drivers not_side not_door
Pos,Very smooth ride and easy to handle The air conditioner works immediately and gets REALLY cold Other than those 2 minor disadvantages the car is wonderful The only thing I have ever had done was oil changes and have had no mechanical problems It is a great car for a family of 4 2 kids and 2 adults fit with no room problems The price was great and I even got extras Automatic door lock air conditioning automatic transmission were all included The engine revs but I find myself pushing myself back and forth in a futile attempt to get the car to perform faster This is my first new car and I was interested in getting the best car for the cheapest price and that is what I got with the Ford Escort The only problem with the climate control is the heat does not not_get not_REALLY not_hot and it does take a long time to heat up this occurs only in the severe cold It is small enough to get in and out of places easily yet does not not_compromise not_comfort not_I not_suppose not_if not_you not_weighed not_over not_200 not_lbs not_there not_might not_be not_a not_problem The only other problem or disadvantage with this car is the pick up I do not not_notice not_any not_problem not_until not_I not_am not_merging not_into not_heavy not_traffic not_and not_have not_to not_make not_a not_quick not_entrance not_onto not_the not_roadway not_it not_just not_doesnt not_happen The back seats are split and either one can come down or both and give more trunk room I notice of all my cars and I have had many this one has the most useable trunk space never have problems with my groceries Gas mileage is great
Pos,The bass and the treble sound great My favorite feature is my sound system I love music and the sound system is good They also had a Ford Explorer when I got my Escort So Ford has been a tradition in my family In cold weather my car has performed up to the standards I think it should as well Overall I have no real complaints about my 1998 Ford Escort I was a little sad that they were discontinuing the Escort in favor of the Focus My Ford Escort is my first car I purchased a Ford because it was made in the United States and I wanted to feel like I was giving back to my community in some way I also got a Ford because Ford products are good and reliable products for the most part My parents had a Ford type vehicle at one point when I was a child and I really liked that car It has enough clarity to play my tunes and keep me happy I do waiver about whether I like the fact that the antenna has to be manually pulled up But I mostly like the fact that it is manual at least its something I dont not_have not_to not_worry not_about not_when not_I not_got not_through not_the not_car not_wash and for the most part I dont not_need not_it not_for not_the not_stations not_that not_I not_listen not_to not_on not_a not_regular not_basis not_My not_Ford not_Escort not_has not_enough not_get not_up not_and not_go not_for not_me not_too not_I not_have not_a not_34 not_mile not_commute not_to not_work not_and not_school not_five not_days not_a not_week but I dont not_seem not_to not_need not_to not_fill not_up not_the not_gas not_tank not_more not_than not_once not_a not_week not_for not_the not_most not_part
Pos,I was originally looking for a Honda and willing to pay the extra thousands of dollars I saved when I purchased my Ford Escort ZX2 Starting college in Sept I ll have enough expenses without spending a lot on a car I didnt not_even not_know not_what not_a not_Ford not_Escort not_was not_and not_when not_I not_was not_looking not_for not_cars It caught my eye Its good on gas and has the power to get up and go I wish it had a little more leg room in the back for passengers but as the driver I dont not_have not_any not_complaints not_I not_drove not_a not_Toyota not_Camry not_prior not_to not_my not_escort and I dont not_feel not_any not_difference not_in not_the not_way not_it not_handles not_I not_basically not_will not_use not_my not_car not_to not_commute not_to not_school not_Anyone not_looking not_for not_a not_economical not_car should check out the ZX2 You ll be surprised its a Ford Escort Excellent for moms with small children since it is a two door Being a two door it is a little difficult for larger people to get in and out of the back as any two door might be
Pos,The trunk is spacious also My six foot 2 sons head does not not_hit not_the not_roof The front seats tilt back enough for roomy leg room It is a four door and the back seat is very roomy My kids can have their friends go with us on trips as 3 people can fit in the back seat My 1998 Ford Escort has almost 36 000 on it and I must tell you I have been very happy with my car It is also very good on gas A tank of gas can last me around 150 miles I think it is very easy to drive and compact enough to find a good parking spot We camp a lot and I can fit in the trunk all the gear we need for a weekend including tent sleeping bags firewood and cooler I plan to pass this car along to my youngest when he turns 16 im sure it will run as well for him as it has for me
Pos,Other than that the temo is a great affordable car She took excelent care of the car and it shows The previous owner of my Tempo was a college student like my self The only disadvantages to the Tempo are it seats it ability for top speed and it breaks My car has verry little rust and the only matenence done on it so far is the 100 000 mile tune up and regular oil changes In the summer it is blazing hot but the Tempo is fully equiped for that The 91 model has a newer AC unit in it that always keeps the car comfortable In the winter i have to contend with lots and lots of snow The Tempo is great for that because of it awsome front wheel drive and its ability to start in sub zero weather My parents own a 1987 Tempo and they will tell you the same thing the Tempo is a great reliable car But back to my car Tempos are great cars for the kind of conditions i have to endure I am the second owner of a cute little 1991 red Ford Tempo My Tempo ha 114 000 miles on it and it is still running like a top I payed 1 900 for it and so far it had been worth every single penny The seats are very likely to make your back sore if you are driving for more than an hour straight the Tempos top speed is about 70 miles per hour so freeway driving kind of sucks and the break roters have to be switched quite often
Pos,It worked This is the best car I have ever owned WHY WE BOUGHT THIS CAR It has a bull bar on the front a tow bar on the back and metal steps on both sides On the sensible side we get a tune up once a year and the engine runs like a dream When we moved to NY from South Africa in 1998 we bought a small zippy Hyundai Accent We bought a big beat up truck so that no one ever again drove into me in my little car It feels safe and solid up to about 65 mph but I try to be a little careful about cornering All in all this truck is a joy to drive and I must admit I rather like the image too It is rusty and dented and since we got it I dont not_think not_I not_have not_been not_cut not_off not_in not_the not_traffic not_once not_DRIVING not_AND not_MAINTENANCE It accelerates like the wind I had to replace the alternator but otherwise I havent had any breakdowns in 2 years Lots of small irritating things have had to be fixed like the door hinges the doors wouldnt not_stay not_open not_the not_wiring not_for not_the not_back not_power not_window not_and not_a not_side not_window and the interior light Thats just because its old I guess Generally all the repairs have been really cheap we replaced part of the exhaust on the Hyundai just the part was over 200 the same piece on the Bronco was 19 I strongly believe that in any accident my family will be better off in this car than just about any other particularly in our price range In the first three months of driving six people literally just drove into us Either they didnt not_see not_my not_little not_car or they thought they were bigger so didnt not_care not_whether not_I not_got not_out not_of not_the not_way not_Since not_I not_was not_driving not_with not_my not_little not_son not_in not_the not_car not_we not_decided not_to not_buy not_the not_biggest not_thing not_we not_could not_afford not_which not_turned not_out not_to not_be not_a not_1989 not_Ford not_Bronco not_XLT
Pos,If you ask me you should own one I love my Bronco I think it has been the best running vehicle I have ever owned I bought it because it was such a good deal that I just couldnt pass it up ive wanted one because they looked roomy One day I was out running around and saw it at such a low price I just had to have it So I took it out for a test drive and it handled so well I took it to have my dad look at it he went with me driving around If you want to enjoy your ride to the store or just anywhere this is the vehicle for you There is plenty of space to put a stroller groceries and the kids too People who cant not_judge not_distance not_of not_your not_cars should not not_own not_this not_vehicle not_because not_you not_are not_pretty not_high not_up not_and not_the not_front not_looks not_pretty not_wide We took it back to the lot and filled out the paper work I got to take it that night I drove around for hours I knew I that I didnt not_go not_wrong not_I not_just not_love not_to not_go not_driving not_around not_because not_it not_runs not_like not_a not_dream is real smooth I like this vehicle so much if I was to win the lottery my whole family would own one
Pos,We ended up with the E250 3 4 ton model with the V 6 engine We have had no mechanical troubles at all and have put 10 000 miles on it to date There are a lot of these vans on the road today with over 200 000 miles on them If we had to do it again we would get the V 8 Otherwise you really cannot not_go not_wrong not_with not_this not_van not_as not_a not_great not_work not_vehicle The 4 6L V 8 makes more power and gets better gas mileage not not_to not_mention not_better not_resale not_value not_if not_you not_sell not_the not_van not_before not_it not_is not_a not_box not_of not_rust Our small business needed a cargo van a year ago and you cant not_really not_buy not_a not_cargo not_van not_without not_at not_least not_considering not_the not_Econoline not_The not_Big not_Three not_all not_make not_cargo not_vans not_that not_are not_comparable not_in not_size not_cargo not_capacity not_and not_price This engine is rated at 190 horsepower and can pull the van reasonably well unless you load it full of tools or heavy equipment Users who will push the limits of the vans cargo capacity will not not_like not_the not_V not_6 not_The not_ONLY not_advantage not_of not_the not_V not_6 not_is not_the not_lower not_acquisition not_cost We researched measured and drove each van for at least 3 days before we made the choice to buy the Ford We found the Ford to be the easiest to drive and the best equipped for the price no matter what engine you choose The Chevy Express Cargo Van was a good second choice but was a little more expensive and the financing offered by GMAC at the time was inferior The Dodge Van frankly hasnt changed a lot since the 70s and it shows in every aspect
Pos,It is a very economical and durable vehicle It is not not_the not_most not_comfortable not_vehicle not_though and it can only hold 2 passengers My vans usually go through a lot of wear and tear I drive around all day from place to place If you are looking for something to be comfortable this is not not_the not_way not_to not_go not_It not_is not_comfortable not_for not_many not_work not_vans not_that not_I not_have not_been not_in not_I not_would not_choose not_a not_car not_to not_drive not_around not_in not_if not_I not_didnt not_have not_to not_carry not_all not_of not_my not_equipment Are you looking for a work van Ford Econoline is the way to go I havent owned anything beside a ford van My last van was a gray Ford Econoline 350 With proper care it lasted me ten years I bought another van this year I was contemplating on whether I should try another van I couldnt even think of another van that would have what I needed
Pos,Needs The back seats also fold down But I digress Features i Anti lock brakes i The handling on higher vehicles is different than cars acknowledge this from the outset and drive accordingly All the repairs were recommended to me as preventive measures when I took the vehicle in for regular maintenance ive never taken my Explorer in for problems And now I have five brand new Firestones I have the extended seven year warranty and havent used it once Definitely a waste of money and completely unnecessary for this vehicle Cost Not only has the ABS on my Explorer saved me from injury it also saved me from rear ending a military police car as my Explorer slid approximately fifteen feet down an icy incline at a stop sign at Fort Leavenworth Kansas in January What irks me about all the condemnation of SUVs for sucking down large amounts of gasoline is that mini vans are just as bad in this respect or any other vehicle with a six or eight cylinder engine While SUVs are status symbols mini vans are family vehicles and trucks are work vehicles All of the owner operator maintenance parts of the engine like the oil wand and the opening for adding more windshield wiper fluid are

and when Texas gets bad weather everything completely shuts down anyway snow and ice holidays yea Gas Mileage Let me get this category out of the way Yes my SUV is a gas hog My Explorer does have a standard transmission which gets slightly better gas mileage than an automatic After three years of driving my college car a Geo Metro and heady with a summers worth of paychecks aka more money than Id ever seen I was in the market for an SUV Id spent the last three years hydroplaning all over Arkansas highways I wanted something big heavy and solid to drive I also wanted more power than my little three cylinder I eventually settled on a Ford Explorer I started shopping around thinking I wanted all the bells and whistles namely four wheel drive I wisely ended up with a two wheel drive

have an SUV the Army will reimburse me a few hundred dollars for moving up to six hundred pounds of my own stuff that I would take with me anyway ive crammed about seven hundred pounds in the cargo

not_like not_about not_the not_Explorers not_visors are that there are two one to flip over to the side and another to flip down in front so that the driver and front seat passenger arent moving one visor back and forth on a curvy road Yes this is a little thing but the great thing about my Explorer are all the details like an attached gas cap that add up to comfort and convenience i Cargo Area i Very roomy The sale price of my 1994 Explorer Sport purchased in September 1994 was 18 168 bargained down from 21 000 sticker price I probably could have gone lower but I had the financial wherewithal to pay off my loan in 3 5 years im pretty satisfied especially given that my insurance premiums did not not_increase not_significantly not_from not_my not_Metro and I havent had to shell out outrageous amounts for maintenance and repairs Conclusion My 1994 Explorer was a good buy and I am loathe to give it up However my needs have changed im moving to a climate that requires four or all wheel drive and I plan to start a family in a few years so a four door model is in order Will I buy another Explorer im still researching but ive narrowed the field to the 2001 all wheel drive four door Explorer and the 2001 four wheel drive four door Nissan Pathfinder I ll let you know in about six months or so Happy driving As a petite woman being up high is an advantage for me I can see the entire road and feel safer and more aware I recommend that short people get the step I dont not_have not_one and its not not_a not_problem normally but getting in the seat can be somewhat tricky when im wearing a mini skirt i Turning Radius i Excellent The Explorer Sport has an exceedingly tight turning radius for a vehicle its size ive driven the four door Explorer and the turning radius isnt not_as not_great not_I not_easily not_swing not_into not_slanted not_parking not_spaces not_from not_the not_opposite not_direction not_or not_make not_U not_turns not_without not_hitting not_curbs not_Repairs and Maintenance ive owned my Explorer for six years and other than the tires the extent of my repairs and maintenance are as follows regular oil changes about every 5 7 000 miles a new air filter last summer adjusted brakes this fall at 62 000 miles some new belts also at 62 000 miles when the original ones began to dry rot new windshield wipers a couple years ago and I had to use epoxy to glue the gear shift knob back on when it came loose
Pos,It has tons of space also Good for long distances It isnt not_hard not_at not_all not_to not_park and it has a great suspension system You could probably run into a brick wall at 50 miles per hour and still walk away The speakers werent too good though so I got them replaced ad I put in a CD player It is a tank I dont not_have not_to not_worry not_about not_dying not_in not_a not_car not_wreck not_in not_this not_car I bought an 86 crown victoria for less than one thousand dollars and it never ceases to amaze me Its got a V8 a 5 liter engine and over one hundred and fifty horse power Other than that everything about my Vic is cool I love this car I am going to keep it until I die or until it quits on me I dont not_know not_which not_will not_come not_first This car might be old but it can definitely kick some but It has a great pick up I have ran into a couple of problems with this car including windows not not_working not_alternator not_not not_working not_A not_C not_not not_cold not_enough and some little minor problems But the car is 14 years old and it is bound to have some problems I have had the car for about 2 years now and I have only brought it into the shop twice Most of the problems that occur with this car are minor things that can be fixed without taking it to the shop I love this car
Pos,As noted by some other reviewers I am having electric window problems The back seat looked like it had never been sat in it was that clean Trunk was so clean it looked like it had never been used At this point rather than yank the motor for my project car ive decided to strip the body off and use it as a base for a kitcar like a Shelby Cobra or something One doesnt work at all and another is slipping while going up requiring me to manually push it up But this isnt not_a not_big not_deal not_since not_I not_am not_the not_only not_who not_rides not_in not_this not_vehicle They finally brought out the Crown Vics which were all from a different agency and the prices became more reasonable I figured I could always adapt the Ford motor to my car if need be It had actually been used by the Alcoholic Beverage Commission in Brownsville and El Paso When I went to review the maintenance records after purchase I found out that these cars had originally been ordered with 302s per VIN but had actually come with 351W with Certified Calibration speedometer Woohoo Anybody wanting a cop car knows what this means Even if you dont not_know not_its not_a not_cop not_car not_this not_is not_usually not_a not_dead not_giveaway not_and not_means not_all not_heavy not_duty not_components not_from not_the not_factory I had gotten the bug to buy a used police car so I could yank the motor and other heavy duty items out of it for a Chevy project car I attended a Texas DPS state police auction to see what I could get When they started auctioning off the Chevy Caprices at 7000 for cars with 105 000 to 110 000 miles I knew the prices were way out of line anybody ever seen a used cop car carpets all ripped stains loose wiring bundles etc and set my sights on a lower priced vehicle What I have found with this car mileage sucks really I usually drive around 75 mph on the highway and I can watch the gas gauge drop 1 2 tank over the course of about 150 miles braking Havent quite experienced brake fade but it is easy to think you re braking when you really arent and have to squeeze harder on the pedal before rear ending someone power initial acceleration sucks but once it is up to speed and in the power band you can barely tap the gas and it will accelerate quickly and once it is going and you take your foot off the gas it will continue to coast and barely slow down
Pos,My first choice was the Ford Explorer It would not not_had not_been not_my not_first not_choice This seemed to do the trick Does the truck drive smooth on the open road It is so easy to drive We even drove the vehicle home that night That is a lot of wear and tear on a vehicle We have actually tested out how safe our truck So I feel safe about Ford Of course we had those unmentionable Firestone tires We could stuff all of the items in the back of the truck So you are probably wondering what did we do when it rained Yes you read that right Unbelievable the truck only received a major blow to the passenger door and front window Why do I like the Ford F150 I will admit at first I didnt not_like not_the not_truck In the long run I am glad that my husband did not not_listen not_to not_me not_I not_love not_driving not_this not_truck No we do not not_have not_top not_to not_it We simply put tarps over the items we kept in the back I know this probably seems strange that I am writing this opinion instead of my husband but I love this truck The second reason my husband chose the Ford F150 is the size of it It has a big bed for transporting items As you already know if you have children especially infants that they require a lot of extra equipment when traveling This was perfect One of the main reasons we chose this truck is because my husband needed a large motor to pull his 19 ft Wellcraft Open Fisherman four hours away from our home Dont get me started on it If you would like to read my review on Firestone Tires just look for Firestone Almost killed my family by davelaura My husband does a lot of hunting and you can only imagine what our first wreck was While driving out in the country near my husbands hunting grounds a deer jumped in the window It is easy to drive I like being up high where I can see everything while driving If you are short like I am this is a nice feature That will give you some idea how I view the tires that Ford uses on their vehicles I dont not_approve not_of not_them not_How not_do not_I not_feel not_when not_I not_drive not_my not_Ford not_F150 No I dont not_feel not_like not_a not_redneck not_I not_feel not_like not_myself not_I not_love not_driving not_this not_truck and would not not_drive not_any not_other not_vehicle not_except not_maybe not_a not_Mercedes but I know that will never happen Here I am in my big white Ford F150 trying to park Can you only imagine I know if my husband saw me during those first few months he would had probably banned me from driving the truck It gets decent gas mileage for a large engine I believe it has a V8 or V6 in it We get about 18 mpg in the city and 23 mpg on the interstate I feel safe in the big truck So what did I do Until I felt comfortable with parking next to cars and other trucks I would pick a parking space as far away as possible so I would not not_hit not_anyone not_Okay not_men not_you not_can not_laugh not_Lets not_get not_serious not_about not_why not_I not_like not_the not_Ford not_F150 not_SuperCab It did take some getting use to First it was really big and bulky I can remember trying to park at the local store in town I think all of the other people knew when I was coming because the parking lots were empty except for a few cars When I was 7 months pregnant with our second child my husband decided that we need a family car I know this does not not_seem not_like not_a not_family not_car but it is used as our family car and I would not not_have not_it not_any not_other not_way not_Why not_did not_we not_choose not_the not_Ford not_F150 not_SuperCab not_First not_I not_have not_to not_say not_that not_my not_husband not_choose not_this not_vehicle We do a lot of traveling and it is one of the smoothest vehicles I have been in I used to drive a Volvo 760 and I would say this truck is almost has smooth as the car Maybe I am pushing the truck a little too much Are the seats comfortable I will admit after four hours in the truck I do get a little cranky but who wouldnt not_after not_that not_long not_of not_a not_drive not_Overall the truck is really comfortable and very roomy I am sorry men if this doesnt help you but maybe it will help convince your wives why you need a truck I was about to kill my husband when he purchased the truck Now I love him for it
Pos,There are some drawbacks though Here is what I discovered Be careful on the turns though or you might lose your load First off the fact that it has the best gas mileage of any truck in its class helps and I have the Big V8 too The Ford has features that make it better suited for the individual who will be travelling mainly highway or town miles for several reasons If you like loud music like me the stock stereo speakers deck are less than desirable No problem right Get some new speakers Problem is without some severe custom work you cant not_even not_buy not_different not_speakers When you fill up a 24 gallon tank that extra 2 miles per gallon helps believe it or not not_Secondly not_the not_acceleration not_on not_the not_Ford was outstanding it was not not_sluggish not_at not_all not_which not_helps not_for not_changing not_lanes not_in not_heavy not_traffic If you want to do a lot of farm work or off roading I would have to go with the Dodge or a larger ford F 250 or F 350 The Ford handles more like a big car and when you are behind the wheel of a Dodge you know you are driving a truck I bought my F150 just over a year ago and I have had plenty of time to formulate an opinion I decided to buy a full size pickup since I was in the military and figured I would be moving a lot I had been looking at the Ford F 150 and the Dodge 1500 both in the same price feature zone The anti lock breaks also offer better braking response than the Dodge I have no complaints with payload either I have an ATV that I drive right up into the bed close the tailgate and go on my way With my weight and the ATV that is a total of about 800 pounds on the tailgate and it takes it just fine without a single stress mark Dont really even notice a difference in acceleration with the extra weight That can be very costly if you dont not_know not_how not_to not_do not_it not_yourself not_Another not_sore not_point not_is not_the not_back not_seat not_The not_Ford not_only not_has not_a not_3 not_door not_extended not_cab not_Dodge not_has not_4 not_doors and the back seat has about 4 inches less leg room than the Dodge Because of the way the back seat folds down in the Ford it makes installing subs or additional speakers almost impossible The Ford also does not not_offer not_any not_kind not_of not_convenience not_console not_like not_digital not_compass not_and not_temperature not_gauge not_the not_Dodge not_does No big deal but here FYI Another piece of advice that I wish I had adhered to If you live in a climate that MIGHT get snow SPEND THE EXTRA CASH ON 4 WHEEL DRIVE I already regret not not_having not_it not_Rear not_wheel not_drive not_only not_even not_with not_weight not_in not_the not_bed is darn near impossible to get up a snowy icy hill I saw 10 or so pickups in the ditch this past winter with little 4 cylinder front wheel drive cars passing them like nothing If you are an Urban Cowboy the Ford is a great choice If you want to add a topper the Ford has a locking tailgate so you can secure the bed without having to buy extra equipment Price will vary from dealer to dealer as you all know but overall the Ford dealers were more willing to drop their price to stay competitive than the Dodge dealers I dealt with Using the site http www edmunds com I found the dealer invoice price so I knew how far they could really go Surprisingly the Ford dealer I bought from went 100 below their invoice to sell me a truck Now grant it it was near the end of the year clearance time but they still beat the dodge by over 2500
Pos,The front foot room is large and would be big enough for a large sized man This truck is an adventure every time that I step into it First of all this is by far the larges vehicle that ive been into In the back there is enough room for children or smaller adults Overall this car is a great experience the only disadvantage is parking this mammoth beast Despite this fact I would recommend this car to anyone The triton V8 engine is so powerful I feel as if I could take on any other car or truck in a race Outside if you like trucks its one of the most beautiful trucks ive ever seen
Pos,You will want to recommend it to your friends and family At the same time it can haul a truck load of rock and sand and still deliver control and smoothness Take it from me I have been in the Landscape Construction business for many years this is the one baby The ride is like being in a car instead of a truck because the suspension absorbs much of the bumps in the road Also the standard and upgrade tires are a bit small for the muscular look of the body Still they do offer some nice alloy rims and good long lasting tires They are very comfortable inside with features from basic vinyl and a radio to an extra port for utilities like a cell phone or a CD 6 speaker stereo The not not_so not_desirable features are that the side view mirrors are attached via plastic so they feel as though they are wearing out when you adjust the mirrors Wether you are a mom a single person a business person an outdoor person construction worker or a lover of trucks you will be very pleased when you drive an F 150 If you are someone who loves trucks but feel comfortable in a car as well this is the truck for you The Ford F 150 series has it all
Pos,It sits up tall and I feel level with many of the 4X4s After driving a car for the past 30 years I decided to buy a truck I investigated the RAM Chevy 1500 GMC and the F150 It feels great looking above all the cars on the road I can see traffic problems much sooner then any car on the road The only problem that I have had is getting use to the rear wheel drive and the rather light rear end of a truck Didnt hit anything just some close calls But that would have happened with any truck ive had the truck for about a year and 1 2 now and I love driving the truck over any car The only thing that I wish I had done was to get the 4X4 But that was another 4 000 00 Never owning a truck before I felt the 4X2 was a good enough start in trucks I bought the V6 It has more then enough horse power The RAM looked pretty good to me but after a test drive I felt the truck was put together rather cheaply Plus the dealers were rude and didnt not_know not_too not_much not_about not_the not_truck not_at not_all not_The not_GM not_products also looked pretty good For some reason they wanted more money for a truck that didnt not_stand not_up not_to not_the not_F150 not_The not_F150 not_is not_good not_looking not_build not_to not_last not_and not_it not_was not_affordable
Pos,It is very stylish and had no defects With the way my truck is running I am sure it will last at least 1 000 000 miles Not once have I had a problem A few weeks ago I took apart the engine to check the wear and there was little or none to be seen I am greatly impressed with this truck The paint is holding up greatly unlike the 80s Aerostars that came out It has maintained its smooth ride and still out performs most chevys and dodges unmodified I have noticed no decline in performance over the years Acceleration has always been great Stereo sound is not not_that not_bad not_considering not_it not_is not_factory I have had my 98 F 150 from the moment it hit the lot Since then I have put over 102 thousand miles on it I have traveled all over the country but primarily from South Texas to Canada through the Rocky Mountains Colorado Wyoming etc Driven in all possible weather conditions I have changed the oil and performed service checks every time it comes around I was concerned with the new transmissions that were placed in this truck but have seen no problems yet Ford did a great job improving and modifying the 96 transmissions
Pos,My husband comes from a Ford family The car would make a wonderful car for anyone The trunk space is more than large enough for luggage or groceries It provides a very smooth ride for short and long trips The car drives like a dream and is easy to steer This is by far the best car that we have owned The only make of vehicle that they will buy is Ford The comfort for long trips is outstanding Comfort should be the Taurus middle name As a mother of small children I love that you can lock the windows and doors at the drivers side The Taurus is well known for its safety Besides being a wonderful family car it looks more than nice enough for any business executive to drive as well The majority of the cars we have owned are also Fords Ford stands for stability and durability The Ford Taurus is a wonderful family car with plenty of leg room The doors are easily locked and unlocked from the outside as well With only 1 turn the drivers side door is unlocked with 2 turns all doors are unlocked I think this is a nice safety feature
Pos,It would also be perfect for a person who does a lot of travelling via automobile We ve driven this car on 18 hour road trips and it has been a dream to ride in its very comfortable whether you are the driver or the passenger For families with more than 2 children I would not not_suggest not_this not_car not_for not_them not_because not_the not_back not_seat not_would not_be not_too not_snug not_especially not_if not_your not_children not_are not_using not_car not_seats not_or not_booster not_seats In my opinion the person who would get the most pleasure from buying this vehicle is someone who wants a really good dependable car possibly with a family that doesnt want to buy a van or larger vehicle The engine is quiet so quiet that one time when I was in a huge hurry I actually ran into a store and left my keys in the ignition and left the car running I didnt not_realize not_until not_I not_returned not_to not_the not_car not_thank not_goodness not_it not_was not_still not_there not_that not_I not_had not_forgot not_to not_turn not_the not_car not_off not_I not_also not_love not_how not_quickly not_the not_car not_cools not_off not_in not_the not_summer not_and not_warms not_up not_in not_the not_winter I own a 1998 Ford Taurus and I have been very pleased with it I bought it in November of 1997 and havent had an ounce of trouble with it We bought this vehicle because I had previously been driving a Pontiac Grand Am and after the birth of our second child we decided that we needed more space I am in my twenties and I wasnt not_ready not_to not_get not_the not_family not_van and felt that the Taurus looked sporty or cool enough but still served the purpose of a family car Some of the many things that I love about this car is the stereo system the sound is great
Pos,We checked out the Camry but the drivers seat felt small and there was virtually no leg room for the middle seats Once you get them use to a van with a cup holder in every corner it is hard to go back We were trading in our Ford Windstar mini van which I liked but really did not not_want not_another not_mini not_van not_when not_I not_began not_my not_search not_for not_the not_perfect not_wagon The wagon seats 8 people we have the third backwards seat I never thought I would see myself saying Yes I want a wagon but I did We still needed space yet I didnt not_feel not_I not_needed not_to not_move not_around not_in not_it not_like not_you not_would not_in not_a not_van not_Having not_three not_kids not_we not_felt not_we not_needed not_that not_third not_seat Brown Wood Grain Siding on a car I know you remember those long brown station wagons I learned how to drive in one of those station wagons I referred to my parents car as the Tank I have had my Taurus Wagon for two years now The wagaon drives smoothly and I have not not_had not_any not_trouble not_at not_all not_with not_it not_We not_take not_it not_in not_periodically not_for not_maintenance not_upkeep not_I not_absolutely not_love not_my not_car not_however not_my not_husband not_feels not_a not_little not_cramped not_compared not_to not_the not_open not_feeling not_you not_have not_in not_a not_van not_Otherwise not_he not_loves not_the not_smooth not_and not_quiet not_ride not_you not_get not_Are not_kids not_have not_had not_one not_complaint not_however not_no not_cup not_holders
Pos,The car gets excellent gas mileage too The trunk is also full of vacant space as well It is worth a test drive or at least a look inside The Ford Taurus would be ideal for a large family of five It is comfortable for five and even six people to fit comfortably It is the perfect car for the cheap price that it is The car has more power than you can imagine with a V6 installed It is not not_even not_considered not_a not_sports not_car and still has the engine and a semi sporty type look On the highway it rides perfectly smooth without any bumps or loud annoying noises that most cars make The front has an endless amount of compartments and unique options to make it easier for both the driver and passengers It will go from zero to sixty in just a few seconds I have never rode in a faster car than this one The seats are very spacious and comfortable especially in the back I could live in the back of this car if I chose there is so much room It handles well in all four seasons I would highly recommend this car to anyone looking at buying a car that will last a long while We have owned our 1998 Ford Taurus for nearly two whole years and have had absolutely no problems or complaints I would definitely choose this model over any other Ford car product especially a probe It even has cruise control I would be going 65 and let off the cruise control on the highway and the car would still be between 60 and 65 for almost a whole entire mile I thought this was incredible It has airbags for both front seats to improve the safety and also has air conditioning You can add a disc changer to the car if you desire which would be very convenient because the receiver is programmed for this You will just have to switch from radio to cd player and there is no hassle Ford could have done away with their rather large round receivers and installed a regular sized one which makes it easier to install your own cd player but I guess a cd changer was a good idea
Pos,We are on our 4th Taurus The 2 k model is by far the best refined edition of this car The 93 Sable 3 8l met its fate during a winter storm and a tree Wife walked away with a sore shoulder We had 98 k and no problems I had a 92 Wagon with 182 k and traded it in when I found the Mustang I wanted My wife is on her 2nd Gen3 The same basic chassis since its 1986 introduction it is even used as the base for the Windstar If we can afford it when we go for our next car we will probably upgrade to the Star The 98 DOHC is by far the best car we have ever owned Plenty of power great mpg and enough room for our family of 4 With family 4 8 hours away and 2 small kids road trip comfort is VERY important
Pos,The ignition problem was while it was still under the original warranty My grandmother gave me this 1998 Ford Taurus brand new a pleasant surprise and a wonderful blessing One time was an ignition switch and the other was something with the power steering But since it hasnt happened again ive forgiven the car its indiscretion of breaking The ignition switch problem did leave me stranded as it gave no warning just died It probably would not not_be not_one not_that not_I not_would not_have not_bought not_myself but it has definitely been a good car Shortly after I got it I moved up north and had to learn to drive in the snow It was very reliable and I have since safely moved back home with not not_a not_ding on it That was better than I hoped for cuz I knew this southerner did not not_know not_a not_thing not_about not_driving not_in not_the not_white not_stuff and there was a lot of it too I have now had the car almost 3 years and in 42 000 miles its only been in the shop 2 times I do not not_consider not_that not_excessive The car has had reasonable gas mileage about what it says on the sticker I find it quite comfortable to drive as well A Taurus is not not_a not_flashy not_car but it is very utilitarian and thats good too I think the trunk is a nice size I dont not_have not_a not_complaint not_in not_the not_world not_about not_this not_car not_for not_what not_it not_is not_a not_car not_to not_get not_you not_around not_reliably not_Its not_not not_sporty not_or not_anything but it is a good car

Pos,This truck is a tight and smooth runner This is my first automatic and I must say it is very smooth With the automatic and the on the fly 4WD switch I have even more room up front with nothing cluttering the floor Id recommend the optional electric camper mirrors I have a 99 4WD extended cab XLT with the gas V 10 engine I have plenty of power to haul a 2700 pound camper I blow by those Dodge diesels chugging up the Rockies every day with this engine I get up to 13 MPG without a load and down to 9 MPG loaded on mountain roads with the automatic In 30 000 miles ive had no problems and have visited the shop only for fluid changes and several recall notices I have added extra overload springs as I felt the single factory springs that came with the camper package was not not_enough not_for not_the not_size not_camper not_I not_have not_on not_it not_I not_would not_consider not_putting not_on not_larger not_tires not_when not_running not_at not_maximum not_gross not_vehicle not_weight not_like not_I not_do not_although not_the not_stock not_aluminum not_rims not_with not_General not_tires not_still not_have not_about not_half not_the not_tread not_at not_30M
Pos,My family recently purchased a 2000 Ford F250 4 door 4x4 with the triton V 8 engine I am extremely satisfied with this truck The interior is very comfortable and there is a lot of room Many vehicles made today are based on economy and are therefore made small Not this truck After running this truck up and down fields through mud pits and through the woods I have come to the conclusion that this truck will not not_only not_take not_everything not_I not_through not_at not_it but it will through it right back at me This truck is based on the old saying Bigger is better Even though the extra sizes makes it not not_that not_good on gas mileage the comfort and style of it well makes up for that Its towing hauling and plowing power is amazing Some trucks are made for work some trucks are made to look and ride nice this is a work truck that looks and rides nice ive put the truck through its hurdles ive tested the acceleration the brakes and the shocks many many times
Pos,And will not not_change We have been a Ford family for the past 30 years So we backed down to the door and purchased the new vehicle We were Truck hunting at Van Boxtel Ford in Green Bay during an ice storm The previous F 250 Ford Truck we owned had 300 000 miles on the engine before we traded it in for another Ford and the only reason we traded it in was that it was not not_a not_4x4 We use this vehicle not not_only for recreation but as a work vehicle also Another way to make sure your engines last is to do regular maintance and always use the same brand of oil and the same brand oil filter That was 8 years ago and now we are at the 300 000 mile on this engine and have not not_had not_any not_problems not_with not_it nor does it use oil Gas mileage is at 20 gallon and we sure cant not_complain not_on not_the not_comfort not_of not_the not_drive We spotted the Black 4x4 in there lot it was in A 1 condition Unsure whether or not we would purchase another at this time because our truck ran perfectly we were going to leave and let them know what our decision was the next day Well low and behold we could not not_make not_it not_out not_of not_there not_lot not_because not_of not_the not_ice
Pos,However for such a beefy ride it eeks out adequate performance This car gives you all the merging confidence you need with power to spare And this has been a FUN and reliable car I feel spoiled by all that power spinning the rear wheels And the optional traction control really works you try to scoot the back end out from under you but you cant not_unless not_you not_push not_that not_little not_white not_button not_hidden not_in not_the not_console not_to not_defeat not_the not_system Headline Avid Honda owner trades for All American made rear wheel drive After 9 wonderful years of Honda Accord ownership I ll save that story for another Epinion I traded in my Champaign colored 1989 Accord LX for a 4 6 liter V 8 equipped 1997 Thunderbird in early 1998 The fit and finish of most American cars have been in question since the 70s so I was pleased to find that this car was well put together Body seams are straight and even and interior members are held in place with relatively few rattles Ah the car of my dreams there are many since my friend Mark Potter bought a 1986 Thunderbird back in 1988 I only paid a couple thousand more for the one year old T Bird than my new Honda back in 89 what a great deal The maintenance has been quite minimal with the first major tune up due at 100 K im only at 45 K Changing and checking the fluids are quite easy with Fords signature yellow color coding under the hood helping you find all the different fluid intakes to keep your V 8 running smoothly However in the rain you better watch out the back end tends to slip during relatively slow turns when the road is slick I like power but not not_for not_powers not_sake not_I not_like not_knowing not_that not_im not_able not_to not_launch not_up not_a not_freeway not_onramp not_without not_the not_fear not_that not_I not_wont not_be not_up not_to not_speed not_while not_merging not_with not_that not_big not_rig not_doing not_70 not_MPH This car loves maintenance and pays you back with smooth performance ive considered trading in this car for an SUV but I cant not_seem not_to not_part not_with not_it not_Whenever not_I not_get not_back not_in not_the not_drivers not_seat not_and not_fire not_up not_that not_big not_engine im glad I have the power luxury comfort and security of a large American car FEATURES 4 6 liter V 8 Traction control ABS Factory alarm Moon roof Leather wrapped steering wheel Alloy wheels Power antenna Power drivers seat While you receive many benefits from having such a large power plant under the hood you sacrifice gas mileage in a BIG way If you drive conservatively you may be able to wring 21 MPG out of a T Bird But if your heavy foot wins over reason much of the time be prepared to give up more cash at the Shell station for that privilege to the tune of 15 or 17 MPG or even less if you REALLY like racing There are body flex noises at times but in a car with such rigid construction something has to give Rigid construction is a major player in handling And this T Bird handles well while flying low and straight on the freeway and gets only a moderate rating in tight corners Why For a car this size it should be much lighter it tends to push the front end while cornering and doesnt reassure the driver the way many lighter front wheel drive cars flatly tackle tight turns
Pos,Of course it could have been because It just looked like a really sweet car In the Thunderbird the oil pressure gauge stood steadily in the middle all the time And the light coming on caused me to have all sorts of worry The dealer started it and I was very enthusiastic about the sound of the engine There it was in the Capital District Auto Guide staring me in the face My Moonlight Blue Clearcoat Metallic 1995 Thunderbird The 99 Jetta my dads driving now is a lot quicker But with the Thunderbird highway driving is something else Then I drove to work and had it towed in Of course it got towed to the wrong dealership It feels like you re at a standstill doing 80 ive never had that before Its one of the best feelings in the world The color and the white letter tires on it did it The right price and the right mileage 38 000 ensured that my dad would be willing to co sign the loan Id never driven such a powerful car before and nothing newer than a 1990 my fathers Daytona I put a deposit down on the car that day I went home I never even gave a thought to drive any sort of Ford vehicle until it came time to replace my 1987 Subaru GL hatchback with 160 000 miles And this was at the first day of my new job Thanks car Not covered by warranty Figure that one out But after the pieces of doody ive driven this stuff is all minor My dad said its cool I took the next day off work and got insurance and purchasing matters taken care of It was mine I could pick it up that night But besides that it ran fine I brought it into the shop and it needed a new oil pump they said I ended up in a rental car driving an Escort Wonderful The car was beautiful and kept very clean I drove it and was amazed by the way it handled and the way it felt just to be in the drivers seat Two problems rear wheel drive and 3 8 liter V6 We live in New York im a young kid and ive only driven tiny Subarus but fortunately he went for it anyway I dragged my sister down to the dealership with me and we took it for a test drive The car was supposed to be in the shop a week but it was only there for three days I went and got the car back and that night sure enough I stopped at a light on the way to work and the oil pressure went down to low and the light came on I screamed and hit the horn Now the car has 78 000 miles on it and I hope nothing else goes wrong with it the warranty is up I have taken this car on so many road trips its amazing I live in Albany and I drive to Massachusetts all the time ive driven to Cape Cod twice I drove to Manhattan once And speeding up on the highway is very effortless I can make the tires squeal pretty easily I love rear wheel drive I just put studded tires on the back last winter and didnt not_have not_a not_problem not_at not_all not_in not_the not_snow not_I not_didnt not_even not_have not_anything not_in not_the not_trunk not_except not_the not_speakers not_I not_feel not_pretty not_powerful not_driving not_this not_beast not_too If only the rest of the process had gone so smoothly I couldnt pick the car up from the dealer for almost a week because there was 900 worth of work to be done to it Why hadnt it been done before the car was put up for sale I DOnt CARE I WANT MY T BIRD GIMMIE Finally I got the car and about a week later the oil pressure gauge would slip down to 0 and the Check Gauges light would come on every time I stopped at a stoplight Now in my Subies the oil pressure would slip down at a stoplight but the light would never come on and it was normal Then they found out that I had somehow blown a bearing in the crankshaft I was none too happy to hear about that But it was fixed for free and I figured that if something else substantial happened to it I could apply the Lemon Law to it but after that it ran just dandy ive had a few problems with it my gas line started to leak because it had been rubbing up against a sharp edge on the gas tank and it rotted but this was covered by my warranty the cruise control module broke the windshield washer fluid no longer dispenses and last but not not_least one day I came back from lunch and went to shut the car off to find that the car WOULD NOT shut off I had to have the battery disconnected and have it towed Come to find out some plastic pin had broken off inside the steering column and I had to pay for just labor Its comfortable and the car is very responsive I can take curves at a very scary speed I got into an accident with this car wrecked the front end on some poor kids Saab in the rain while trying to merge and when I drove the rental Lumina I noticed how badly it handled around curves and then I realized that Id taken the Thunderbirds handling for granted it handled a lot better than anything else Id driven I love this car so much I really want a 97 with a V8 and leather and im not not_real not_thrilled not_about not_the not_job not_the not_body not_shop not_did not_on not_the not_front not_end and im also really scared because of all those head gasket horror stories but this car is like a part of me I love being able to tell people that I drive a Thunderbird And I want to be able to do that as long as possible and I know I cant not_spend not_forty not_grand not_next not_year not_I not_also not_have not_turned not_into not_a not_car not_snob not_Because not_this not_car not_just not_screams not_BEEFCAKE not_while not_all

not_picture And one time going to Cape Cod and the drive to Manhattan were both complete spur of the moment trips ive owned the car for almost two years now and put 42 000 miles on it Thats twice the average Considering how much I drive this car and pound the doody out of it the things that have gone wrong with it are pretty insignificant Its a beautiful car lots of potential for modifications I only wish for a V8 leather 5 speed and I think instead of buying a new car I want to trade this in on a 97 with the V8 and leather I put a Kenwood deck in it all new Kenwood speakers in the doors and in the rear I had the basic cassette tape player when I bought the car and I thought it was terrible a Kenwood changer in the trunk and 2 12 JL Audios and a Kicker amp in the trunk Even with all that stuff in the trunk I can still fit a good amount of groceries back there And theres always the backseat Its usually just me and Dave in the car so I dont not_even not_worry not_about not_it but I find that the backseat is pretty damn big compared to the Subarus ive driven and the Escorts and Sentras you see all over the place I have the 3 8 liter V6 and its quick but it could be a lot quicker
Pos,I am very impressed with this large people hauler Why get one Good towing capacity hauling capacity and people mover And the biggest factor RELIABILITY on this van is great I know many who have had great experience with the Ford Econoline I only hope if I get one I have the same great experience Now that I have driven one and am a college student who hauls around a lot of stuff and people I am looking to purchase one of my own within the next year and a half The overall quality of this vehicle seems to be higher than what I have seen on GM and DC vans First impressions I knew at first these were large vehicles I also knew that I would be hauling around 14 passengers The ride was very smooth over all pavement except for on grooved pavement Handling was good and the van seemed to hold to curves very well considering its size City driving also wasnt not_very not_hard not_Only not_caution not_I not_have not_is not_to not_not not_cut not_your not_right not_turns not_to not_close or you ll go for a joy ride over the curb Scary thought at first especially since I had never before had the chance to drive an extended version of the club wagon Overall I have to admit once I began driving this vehicle I fell in love with it The interior of the van was rather quiet considering there were about a dozen people conversing
Pos,Also the trunk is small Coupes are not not_hatchbacks And supposedly the reliability ratings for new escorts have been decent And then there is a lot more noise after about 5000 RPMs Oh and a huge disappointment to me the transmission is not not_overdrive Also you get keyless entry if you opt for the power group One thing to note is that it is a four seater No old lady will pass you as you are trying to merge Most people compliment me on the car and everyone thinks it cost a lot more One example of questionable cost cutting is that the alternator is rated at 48 AMPS and is a heavy duty model My recommendation is test drive it take it on the highway roll the windows up and see if its managable It seems about right and this is fast for a compact Its on par with cars like the Eclipse There was no complaining from three passengers in the back after over eight hours in the car and I got my share back there too It is listed as overdrive on a number of websites and I thought it was but it isnt not_Expect not_about not_3000 not_RPMs not_at not_70mph If above else you want a good looking car with some pep for cheap this is definitely among the strongest contenders especially if they offer 1500 back again My guess is this is largely responsible for low gas mileage reported 27 33 although ive been getting more like 24 29 though its still early to count If those things are very important go with a Corolla or a Civic you will make up the difference in price when you sell I checked blue book values If you want bottom priced car and can get this car for around 11 K without options I think you are getting a better deal than you would with an Accent or a Kia Rio As far as reliability I still dont not_really not_trust not_it not_It not_doesnt not_really not_feel not_like not_a not_solidly not_built not_car not_although not_I not_am not_sure not_dont not_know not_though not_that not_it not_compares not_very not_well not_with not_cars not_in not_the not_10 not_K not_range The other day I left a 300 ZX in the dust yeah yeah you dont not_have not_to not_tell not_me not_he not_was not_probably not_asleep but it still felt nice Seriously though this car is fast enough to be fun There is no middle seat belt Check the roominess stats on your favorite car web site it isnt not_much not_even not_Corolla not_has not_more not_hip not_room not_in not_the not_back but it is enough Four people are comfortable and five people is manageable So I didnt not_have not_to not_deal not_with not_insults not_from not_friends not_after not_all not_And not_it not_doesnt

not_including not_some not_long not_road not_trips You will need to shift a little more the gear ratio is definitely shifted to the low end Expect to shift out of first almost immediately and expect to be in 5th at about 45 if you want power though 2nd gear will carry you into the 60s As far as trunk room you d do better with almost anything else Echo Focus Corolla Civic except may be for the Accent But again I think the trunk is sufficient 5 people fit their stuff for a 5 days trip with no problems including sleeping bags OK now for actual driving Oh turn the radio and the sales person off until you want them back on The engine is pretty fast and the tranny is responsive Unfortunately this is my first manual transmission car so my opinion is fairly unsubstantiated Somewhere I saw the acceleration stat of 0 60 in 7 8 seconds Id call it bad engineering May be engine timing isnt not_as not_good not_may not_be not_compression not_ration not_is not_low may be transmission sucks Probably all of the above and more I was seriously considering getting a Corolla Echo gets expensive quick after you add some necessary options The car is noisy Perhaps not not_too not_noisy if you are used to driving Ferraris but it is very noisy if you are used to Corollas Noise is definitely hard to ignore if the radio is off it is virtually impossible Having a conversation with someone is hard with normal voice Road and wind noise are enough but the engine also makes a lot more noise after about 3000 RPMs In no other car I found do you get as much included and after all is said and done the car was less than 10500 withOUT the college rebate i didnt not_end not_up not_using not_my not_friend not_at not_ford not_this was a lower a price than he could get I also think it is the best looking car under 13 K and it holds its own for higher priced cars However if you see yourself spending 13 K or so on this car I would definitely say give some other cars a very close look Another thing to remember is that this is either the last year or close to it for the Escort The Focus is replacing this car and the ZX3 has the same engine but is a much better overall car Without cash back the two cars cost almost the same Most cars in fact all other cars I saw use at least an 80 AMP alternator Odds are the thing will need replacement early especially if you are using lots of utilities on the car I think this review is getting pretty long but hopefully I gave you more than a re listing of features you can find anywhere else For the money it was a good car I sacrificed gas

car engines I expected my high gas mileage requirement to be easily filled however no car under 13 K did that Granted I want more than most people seem to from reading other opinions on numerous cars I am fairly environmentally conscious and I would buy the Honda Insight in a second if I could afford it I expected a car with at least 30 miles a gallon in the city and in the 40s on the highway It

mph but there is no reason to be I trust you ll keep this a secret but on a recent road trip I took the car up to about 110mph with a full trunk and 5 people in the car And the engine was still comfortable at around 5000 RPMs red line is at 6500 Assuming there is no governor on it this car will easily top out the speedometer 120 Now the point isnt not_that not_you not_should not_drive

Pos,This car tricked me into buying it It has a sleek sexy exterior as well as a playfully agressive stance that looks very sporty and fast Those of you who are interested in building a hot street racer or just tricking out your car for fun should definately get this car About 6 months ago I purchased a brand new 2001 ZX2 right off the lot and since then ive learned a whole lot about cars including one thing The interior has very comfortable seating and the 4 cyl Z Tech engine peels this little car off the line every time you floor the gas But if you re looking for a contender in the sports car class this isnt not_it not_Dont not_let not_it not_trick not_you not_too If the Ford Mustang were a bar of soap the ZX2 is what it would look like after about 10 uses I think everyone looking for a new sporty and affordable car should at least give the Escort a test drive Its such a well rounded 4 banger for the price that its hard to form an opinion for or against the car You ll just have to go see for yourself There is room for improvement in all areas and if you re seen driving this car with some hot ground effects on it you ll definately turn heads because not not_many not_parts are out for the ZX2 If you really want something that can talk the talk and walk the walk from off the lot then you might want to consider another car such as the VW Jetta or the Honda Prelude However if you re looking for a beautiful and affordable ride that looks and feels sexy and sporty but wont get you a ticket this is the car for you I bought the ZX2 because at the time I just wanted something new fully loaded and affordable and this is what I ended up with In retrospect I would have much rather invested my money in something with less extras and more horses
Pos,It does step right out when you want to go unlike some cars that take forever to reach the 65 speed limit on our expressways That was after a 1500 Ford rebate I havent even found any little things that require taking it back to the dealer like you usually do when you buy a new car or used one for that matter This car is as good or better than any of the others that we ve owned Its fun to drive very comfortable for the two of us that own it and use it It wouldnt not_be not_a not_good not_choice not_for not_a not_family not_only not_seats not_4 but it does have a good sized trunk My gas mileage is regularly in the 30 mph range I do a lot of short trips and a few 100 mile trips and the mileage has been around 30 every time we ve filled it I didnt not_get not_the not_cd not_in not_it just the radio and cassette player so have no problem with a cd changer in the trunk The only problem I have at this time is that we cant not_find not_a not_good not_place not_to not_mount not_the not_deer not_whistlers not_that not_we not_put not_on not_all not_of not_our not_vehicles not_I not_ended not_up not_paying not_a not_little not_under not_14 not_000 not_for not_the not_car not_with not_cruise not_control not_comfort not_group not_which not_included not_air not_conditioning not_and not_the not_power not_package not_which not_gave not_me not_power not_windows not_door not_locks not_and not_keyless not_entry I ordered my ZX2 on Jan 22 before I read the opinions already written I now have around 2 000 miles on it and I really like the car a lot I was ready to hate the car because it took 10 weeks from day of order to day of delivery I was also prepared to be disappointed in the performance of the car because I read some of the negative comments on this page Neither have been the case the car is a 4 speed with cruise control which works extremely well even on hills ive been driving small Fords since 1972 when I got a Pinto and have gone through the Pintos and the Escorts ever since
Pos,The original factory paint has faded a good deal as well It tends to skip alot easier these days The old Epinion can be found at http crimson epinions com auto review 1F78 E3A62CD 382F40DA bd3 The other problem that has recently cropped up is with the factory CD player and stereo However the stereo is a minor detail and really im quite surprised it has lasted this long The lights in the lcd radio display have burned out and the CD player is being less than cooperative these days The car is nearly 12 years old now and I have had it for 6 Its now got near enough to 180 000 miles The Body is still solid and showing very few signs of rust although the Ohio weather has not not_been not_great not_on not_some not_of not_the not_underside The brakes have started making horrid noise in reverse and I havent yet been able to figure out why even though I have changed all the brakes Its now been a year since I wrote the first epinion on my 89 Ford Probe and I would like to say that the car is still running great although I have had to do a few more repairs Due to the many emails and enquiries I have had concerning my original Epinion on the 89 Ford Probe I am writing an update to that Epinion For some reason Epinions wont let me edit my old Epinion and so I am writing a new one It seems that the CD player uses a plastic gear system to pull the CD in and out of the player and I believe that a few cogs have broken off of the gears Sometimes the CD will not not_go not_all not_the not_way not_in and begins to make an awful clicking sound I think that the lazer is near to burning out as well The roof of the car has become somewhat dull over the past few years and the paint seems to be rather thin up there by now I dont not_know not_that not_this not_is not_due not_to not_poor not_craftmanship not_or not_whether not_its not_due not_to not_Ohios not_harsh not_weather not_I not_still not_highly not_recommend not_the not_1989 not_Ford not_Probe not_however not_because not_of not_the not_general not_reliability not_of not_the not_car not_and not_the not_lack not_of not_major not_repair not_work not_that not_I not_have not_had not_to not_do not_on not_it not_I not_recently not_drove not_the not_car not_all not_the not_way not_to not_Chicago not_from not_Ohio not_and not_this not_was not_a not_7 not_hour not_drive not_and not_we not_spent not_a not_good not_hour not_and not_a not_half not_sitting not_in not_a not_traffic not_jam not_the not_car not_did not_not not_overheat not_at not_all not_and not_we not_made not_it not_nearly not_the not_entire not_way not_on not_one not_tank not_of not_gas not_I not_didnt not_have not_to not_fill not_up not_till not_we not_got not_within not_20 not_minutes not_of not_Chicago not_and not_if not_it not_werent not_for not_the not_huge not_traffic not_jam not_we not_probably not_would not_have not_made not_it not_all not_the not_way not_without not_needing not_to not_fill not_up not_again
Pos,It now has 125 k miles The motor and transmission have been ROCK SOLID The perspective from the drivers seat is excellent These are all expected normal wear and tear items The 3 0L is a really tough motor no wonder it is in just about all the other Fords Ranger Taurus Sable Aerostar Windstar Tempo Topaz and the Mazda pickups The thing growls and rumbles alot like a V8 Suprises alot of Honda and other 4 cyl owners out there Cars that I owned previous to this one 1985 Ford Escort 1987 Toyota Celica GT 1991 Toyota Celica GTs 1991 Nissan 240SX 1991 Mitsubishi Eclipse GS I bought my 1990 Ford Probe LX 3 0L V6 about 4 years ago Since then ive had to replace the brakes front rotors the radiator and a few radiator hoses a power steering hose and the rear wiper motor Also it is in need of some new injectors The Manual transmission is very strong and it shifts very smoothly and is the perfect match to the 3 0L V6 motor Handling on snow and ice are pretty good if you are careful studded or all season tires help tremendously I basically have no problems dropping a gear and passing people if I have to There is PLENTY of trunk space under the hatch and good space up front however typical of a car like this the rear seats are fairly cramped You can raise or lower your seat with the automatic controls on the side as well to help with visibility and comfort I really like being able to see the hood when I drive as well as the pop up headlights good for aiming the car down the road All of the power options are nice Power windows power steering power seats power mirrors power antenna etc Anti lock brakes come in handy on ice believe me I KNOW living in Alaska For you gear heads into modifying cars the 3 0 seems to be very responsive I installed a cat back exhaust w high flow muffler and a K N Filter
Pos,Have you driven a Ford lately The car I havent told you about the car So everything is great Mechanically the car is wonderful The Escort of today has a much larger body and a spacey interior It is a very practical car for a teenager to drive What is there to say I have no complaints My friends do it so should I All of my friends sadly own Escorts So I went with them to get a newer car We got a 1994 Escort Mine is actually the exact car they show in the 1998 escort picture only mines a 99 But the problem was solved when I asked my mom buy me speakers for Christmas It says something that I have gone out and bought two of the same car The ZX2 I own the four door model which is quite different than the ZX2 pictured by opinions The only problem it has was one of the speakers had been blown out by the previous owner This one had air a CD player power mirrors and power seatbelts so I did manage to get some more stuff That was a plus but not not_necessity I grew to love that car I really did Now first off my title might be a bit misleading Owning an Escort doesnt make you spoiled by any means Then the next problem came my CD player died I was able to pick up a Pioneer flip face CD player nice stuff at Best Buy on Sale Other than that I loved it and it loved me However a couple of months back I learned the inevitable lesson that you cant not_drive not_through not_other not_cars Me and L own 99 four door sedans surprise surprise so far no problems and no costs outside of gas and oil chnges owns a 95 Neon poor poor has had to put her car in the shop for the check engine light poor poor girl she should have bought an Escort And I lost my car to the totaled gods Because I bought the car so cheep I worked my finagling powers I ended up making a bit of cash off the wreck Because when the car is totaled the insurance company gives you market value of the car So after a month of no car I went on a search for another car With the money I had made off the accident I was able to spring for a nicer car Although I was looking at 1997s originally I realized that I could spend about the same for a 1999 At the time I thought I had a job that was an hour or more away so I sprung for the 99 Again I love my car I have an automatic remote keyless entry power mirrors and all that fun stuff I honestly love my car and better yet I was able to get the old speakers and CD player installed into the new car It cost me 250 but it was nice and it has and will last me for quite some time For a surprise my mom paid for that for my birthday though She didnt not_have not_to and I told her that But she did and I love it And those were the only two problems I ever had with the car Just the audio system The sad news is that you can say goodbye to the sedan After 1999 they are being replaced by the Focus which is an equally cute car if you ask me But the Escort legacy isnt not_going not_to not_dye not_so not_soon not_Ford not_is not_planning not_on not_keeping not_the not_ZX2 not_around not_for not_a not_while not_My not_ties not_to not_the not_Escort not_This not_is not_my not_third not_Escort not_Yes not_my not_third Its not not_like not_my not_parents went out and bought me luxury car or anything As a matter of fact my parents didnt not_go not_out not_and not_buy not_me not_anything not_I not_bought not_it not_myself and I also make my own insurance payments I am not not_looking not_for not_wide not_spread not_acclaim by stating that just that I am not not_a not_materialistic not_suburban not_brat not_Now not_to not_the not_car not_I not_love not_my not_car They are cheep have great gas mileage cheep to insure I mean come on how perfect is that M drives a 98 ZX2 so far no problems and no costs outside of gas and oil changes L owns a 97 four door so far no problems and no costs outside of gas and oil changes J owns a 93 two door so far only problem was when car was side swiped and insurance paid for the fixing out side of that no costs outside of gas and oil changes It says something that the 1982 Escort with 250 000 miles was still going Fords have a bad rep with some people Maybe they have been burned before but I am happy as a pig in mud I could sit here and tell you that the car has decent pick up I can tell you that I have had nothing but success I could even tell you about how comfortable the seats are but I think the fact that so many are on the road lets the car speak for itself The ZX2 is a two door model that has more of a pinched tail end and a bit more of a bullet shape overall Its the sporty Escort My best friend owns a ZX2 and she couldnt be more pleased with it Although its not not_the not_car of her dreams it is still her baby and she couldnt be happier The Sedan Most people dont not_associate not_a not_real not_car not_with not_the not_Escort not_name not_I not_have not_heard not_time and again Wow Escorts have changed this is like i a car i Now as intellectual as this comment might sound it is all to true Up until recent years Escorts have been cheep looking hatchbacks When I first got my license I drove around in the car my step grandmother had driven since she bought it brand new in 1982 Ha Yes I drove an 1982 manual Escort with no air conditioning or any other perks for that matter including a radio Not to mention the 250 000 miles it had racked up But that was just fine I loved it because it was a car it was my car However it started to encounter some mechanical problems finally and we The rents and my self thought best if I got a bit newer car because they didnt not_want not_me not_to not_be not_a not_16 not_year not_old not_female not_stranded not_on not_the not_road not_somewhere
Pos,You hear every little shift and brake the car makes One of the bonuses though is the power brakes steering windows and doors My husband and I were looking for a new vehicle our first and decided on a Ford Escort The one thing I really dislike about my car is the engine noise is extremely loud The price was right between eleven and twelve thousand dollars and the four doors are appropriate for a family of four It fits a stroller diaper bag and other baby supplies beautifully Driving is smooth but the passengers feel all bumps The back seat fits 2 car seats but not not_much not_else not_Trunk not_space is great if you are going on a nearby vacation or camping somewhere There is expandable leg room for the front and the bucket seats also recline I really feel this car is great in price size and comfort for new parents I love to drive my car and with 2 kids everything seems to fit well into the trunk for long trips to the grocery store or Grandmas house
Pos,About a year and 1 2 ago my motor went in my 1990 Cavalier It didnt not_have not_all not_the not_option not_I not_was not_looking not_for not_so not_the not_dealing not_order not_up not_the not_parts and had the options added I took it for a test drive and bought it I never had a brand new car before so this was very exciting I have it it for one year now and I love it It has power locks sunroof rear spoiler mag wheel and lots of power I would just like you all to know before purchasing a used car and someone elses headache check into what it will cost you to buy a brand new one Its well worth the feeling of owning a brand new one So I started to look for a used car I was looking for something a little sporty but reasonable to afford Because my kids are older and have their own cars now I do not not_need not_the not_old not_fashion not_station not_wagons not_to not_cart not_them and their friends around in I looked at many models and at many dealers I found a few to be at my interest After review loan and interest with banks I found that buying a brand new car my payment would be fairly close to the payment for a used car I decided at that point to look at the 1999 Escorts I went to the dealer and the model that was in the show room was an awesome color very sporty looking
Pos,My car was and is a great buy I recently purchased a 1999 Ford Escort The company handled my questions quickly and efficiently The trunk is midsize and can fit almost anything This car is small and along with it come small shocks The wind pushes you around also and can be scary at times The back seat can be pulled down for more room for larger things The windshield wipers wash the rain off but some of it stays on the side of the window The crash rating is high I had a little fender bender and Ford fixed it quickly in a week or less The tire rims always need cleaning I can clean them and go driving for an hour just to come back and have them dirty again It gets great mileage and a full tank usually costs around 11 00 with gas prices being 1 21 The Escort is a nice economy sized car and is excellent for the whole family This is a great car I bought it because I like small cars and I feel safe in it The drive once you get used to it is nice The sound system makes you feel like you are there at a concert Even better is that some Escorts have a 6 cd changer in them Problems with the Escort is the bumpy ride I am used to bigger cars this is quite a change More noise retention is needed with this car
Pos,The handling is awesome The cruise control keeps the set speed very well The factory installed power moon roof has never leaked There are some drawbacks to this engine though This car inspires confidence in the driver and the tires have never squealed on me yet The ride is pretty good too The car has plenty of power in 5th gear therefore when I want to pass on the parkway a downshift into 4th is not not_needed I am 19 years old and have had my ZX2 for a little over a year im happy to say that it has proved to be quite reliable Most of the large potholes are absorbed well and the suspension makes a nice thud noise Braking is O K My car is equipped with ABS but the brakes dont not_have not_an not_initial not_grippy not_feel not_Interior The seats are nicely shaped up front and the back seat is not not_bad not_for not_hauling not_around not_friends not_I not_just not_recently not_completed not_a not_two not_hour not_road not_trip and the car proved comfortable coming and going However after reading some newspaper articles about the ZX2 it turns out this is normal Ford intended the A C to cycle to save gas Once the engine gets this car moving the suspension does not not_let not_you not_down No problems with the power windows locks or keyless entry I did have an after market CD player put in the dash and because of the oval pod I had to pay 50 to get a special faceplate Overall I am very pleased with my decision to buy the ZX2 It is kind of noisy at speeds above 3 000 rpm but thats O K most small 4 cylinders are More annoying is that when the A C is on the compressor is always cycling turning on and off and it makes it feel as though the car has misfired When I went looking for my first car my father and I looked at every conceivable small car on the market Tercel Corolla Civic Protege Contour Mirage Saturn SL2 and Sentra Except for the Saturn all of these small cars were excellent The Saturn is sold by great dealers but the car itself is unrefined There are times however when I would have liked to have the extra two doors of a sedan but whenever I long for those two doors the admiring looks I get from other drivers in their dowdy sedans SUVs and minivans always changes my mind Not to mention the internal joy I get when I drive this car IT IS JUST PLAIN FUN So why did I buy the ZX2 Well first off the ZX2 had the most horsepower 130 Only the Contour with the V 6 had more 170 Also I had just read an article in the May 1997 issue of Car and Driver in which the ZX2 came in first place when compared to other small coupes Moreover Consumers Reports had rated the 99 model at above average reliability something that other domestic sedans Cavalier and Neon could not not_say not_But not_enough not_with not_the not_boring not_stuff not_what not_the not_car not_is not_like not_in not_action not_is not_what not_convinced not_me not_to not_buy not_Performance not_I not_cant not_say not_enough not_about not_this not_cars not_acceleration not_but not_0 not_60 not_in not_8 not_0 not_seconds not_should not_sum not_it not_up not_pretty not_well
Pos,The car looks sporty The automatic transmission is smooth They do the job But thats all The seats are nicely designed but slightly small The ZX2 seems to be breaking away from the overall Escort category The car does sit a little higher off of the road than most sporty vehicles It handles well but doesnt quit stick to the corner Gearing is good But its less in everything but the most luxury cars these days There actually seems to be more leg room than there is in the Taurus And theres a good reason for this This isnt not_an not_Escort not_Its not_more not_like not_a not_slightly not_smaller not_Probe Though the horn needs to be a little more sensitive Outside mirrors are adequate though they seem a bit chintzy To get the same ammenities on any other car I looked out would have taken the price over the 20 K mark If you re not not_over not_6 and not not_over not_200 lbs you probably wont notice this The sound system is excellent Other controls are easy to reach Which is something you cant not_say not_about not_any not_of not_the not_other not_Fords save the Mustang And the Mustang has rear wheel drive and costs a couple grand more While there is still a small Escort on the back there is a large ZX2 in script on the rear window rear bumper and on the backs of the front seats The model I purchased came with everything Power windows power doors a 6 cd changer power mirrors anchored floor mats fancy wheels larger tires tilt steering wheel and the price tag was still around 16 K The cabin is a bit noisy during acceleration but about what you d expect for a subcompact with a bigger than normal engine in it Cornering in normal driving is good but sharp cornering is not not_quite not_what not_it not_should not_be The engine is a Contour engine so it has a bit more getup and go It still pulls a bit too much RPM when you floor it but its better than a Plymouth Breeze or Dodge Stratus Inside there is surprising room im 6 5 tall and I actually have headroom Shoulder room is a little less
Pos,This car has a lot to offer including exceptional power a 130HP Ztech engine This car has a lot to offer including exceptional power a 130HP Ztech engine Ok anyone who is looking for a car under 17 000 that is a coupe should take a look at the Ford Escort Zx2 The Automatic will cost more but I think it is funner to drive Lets hope that Ford dosent discontinue this nice car The Automatic will cost more but I think it is funner to drive Lets hope that Ford dosent discontinue this nice car It has improved so much over the years I had a Mercury Tracer before and I loved it I love my ZX2 more though I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a quality made car thank you It has improved so much over the years I had a Mercury Tracer before and I loved it I love my ZX2 more though I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a quality made car thank you Ok anyone who is looking for a car under 17 000 that is a coupe should take a look at the Ford Escort Zx2
Pos,We decided on another escort This one would be a sedan lx with a standard trans We have had no troubles at all with this car We needed something to balance everything out so to speak If you are looking for a fuel efficient VERY dependible car the ford escort is for you We decided instead of getting all that replaced we would just get a new car It proved to be a great little car the explorer is our vacation daily driver the escort is our around town daily driver The biggest problem is that it is a little underpowered no pick up at all Another one is the seats are not not_very not_comfy and it is cramped front and back We have a big gas guzzling roomy dependible explorer now we needed a not not_so not_roomy fuel efficient just as dependible car we had had great luck with the old escort and we decided once again to get one We just bought a ford explorer and got rid of our old escort and then kept our camry had 115000 miles on it while the escort had only 60000 what a mistake that was the camry pooped out on us Now dont not_get not_me not_wrong not_the not_camry not_was not_a not_great not_little not_car not_well not_mid not_sized not_car but it had a lot of miles and needed a new trans and the engine was soon to come
Pos,The Ford Escort is a good car for average size people I would not not_recommend not_this not_car not_for not_larger not_people My wife is 5 2 and loves the way it handles and that she can see over the steering wheel I will purchase another Ford in the future IF the follow up service is improved I bought the 1999 Ford LX in November of 1998 I was looking for a dependable small car with a reasonable price I have not not_been not_disappointed not_with not_the not_car not_itself not_I not_have not_25 not_000 not_mile and it runs like a dream I took a trip from South Dakota to Mississippi this summer 2300 miles and was very comfortable the entire trip The car is great However the service has NOT been so great after purchasing I noticed a flaw in the window molding I reported to Ford when they did the Customer Satisfaction phone call I was told to take to my local dealer where I had purchased the car I was told they would fix it but could not not_right not_now not_I not_have not_called not_a not_few not_times not_to not_see not_when not_it not_would not_be not_fixed not_and not_have not_been not_given not_no not_time not_that not_it not_can not_be not_taken not_care not_of not_I not_am not_a not_easy not_person not_to not_deal not_with but the noise from the window may change that pretty soon

Pos,In June of 2000 my 1989 Mercury Tracer finally kicked the bucket That was a two door coupe which was basically a big red problem The car was and still is under factory warranty so off I went back to the dealers to get it fixed And I was an even happier camper The four door Escort is a practical family car for me with just one child which gets excellent gas mileage I have had no major problems with it and no costs except gas and oil changes Oh wait I did have one cost I had one flat tire due to the fact that there is always construction going on and almost always near someplace I need to be I have only had one minor problem with the tape player Yes I said tape player And then tired of being ignored and treated like a stupid woman by salesmen I asked my dad to go with me We chose the 1999 Ford Escort SE in silver And I cannot not_say not_enough not_good not_things not_about not_it not_I not_adore not_it not_My not_son not_who not_is not_2 not_still not_refers not_to not_it not_as not_Mommys not_New not_Car not_even not_though not_ive not_had not_it not_for not_nearly not_seven not_months not_now So off I went carshopping with my father I trust his opinion and knew he d help me choose a good car Besides I had learned the hard way that car salesmen ignore solitary women I shopped alone read Consumer Reports faithfully and followed their Reliability Charts on used cars I noted that the Escorts reliability had improved drastically over the past ten years I began looking toward an Escort being an economical solution to my dilemma The only drawback to the Escort lies not not_with not_the not_car but with me I am not not_used not_to not_owning not_a not_car not_as not_new not_as not_this not_one not_so not_I not_am not_sure not_the not_salesman not_who not_helped not_me not_as not_well not_as not_the not_automotive not_department not_is not_probably not_tired not_of not_seeing not_me not_Every not_little not_noise not_and not_back not_I not_went not_I not_was not_fearful not_of not_something not_major not_going not_wrong not_as not_it not_had not_with not_my not_Tracer not_Nothing not_is not_wrong not_with not_the not_car not_I not_was not_and not_still not_am not_a not_paranoid not_new not_car not_owner
Pos,Otherwise I have no complaints It has a smooth shifting transmission and the handling is top notch The only shortcomings are stiff seats go for the extra comfort seats If you need a small car and you are on a budget you can not not_beat not_this not_car I owned an Escort several years ago and I didnt not_care not_for not_it not_mainly not_because not_of not_a not_bad not_3 not_speed not_transmission It is the best equipped car for the price I checked out a Saturn Cavalier Honda Civic Hyundi Dodge Neon etc and nothing came with the features and a better price It is also well reviewed by other consumer mags so ask around and you will see that everyone loves this little car Ford was actually going to discontinue the Escort but with the new design it has been a huge success and they are keeping it Buy it now But now with the new Escort its like a totally different car I considered this car at first mostly because of the price I purchased this new Escort a couple months ago I already have 10 000 miles on it and it is the best compact I have ever had The engine is quite fast and the features for the price are out of this world I have air automatic power locks power doors power mirrors rear defrost car alarm etc
Pos,Ford rushed the redesigned F 150 into production And keep opening doors Your golf or tennis pro says it today You heard it from Coach back in high school You hear the same thing from your kids martial arts instructor Did they do the job Lets look and see First Lets Talk Choices This vehicle is in no way a purchase for the decision challenged person The first models rolled out in mid summer and are sitting on showroom floors now The large steering wheel makes reaching left hand controls and the ignition a little tough occluding both wiper and light controls Only two engines and one transmission is about what they offer in their bottom of the line compacts Whew I think that makes forty seven different combinations but I lost count somewhere in the bed lengths In a departure from previous steering the driver maintains a good road feel even through the power steering system and that certainly helps You can also purchase special towing packages including an obstacle sensing radar system for the rear and a snow plow package for your 4x4 The big question is Did the competition bring out the best in the F 150 What Was Wrong with the F 150 Further back flares on the rear fenders have a flat strip integrated at their outer edge instead of the smooth curve of last years F 150 Where Ford seems to have paid the most attention is not not_in not_design not_although not_its not_certainly not_changed not_but not_in not_materials Those are just the basics of course Ford offers the truck in eleven different colors and with two different standard engines and two transmissions At the moment 2003s are selling at 5000 7000 discounts and you ll get a darned good truck for that price Hurry though cause the selections are dwindling Then too Ford saddled the 4200 pound truck with a standard 4 2 liter V6 so under powered 202 hp that a basic model couldnt outrun its own shadow While lower end models like the 2003 STX Sport I drove last month were once slathered with cheesy looking plastics the materials in the 2004 have a more solid look To sum up Ford has indeed touched on every major system in the new F 150 frame suspension transmission engine they cheated a bit there and interior and exterior design By the way the cargo boxes are now two inches deeper than before the side rails are a whopping 54 inches off the ground Now go back toward the front and open the doors And second why do they steadfastly refuse to even offer optional side airbags or a canopy system we know thay have one from their SUVs Three 5 5 not not_available on regular cab 6 5 not not_available not_on not_SuperCrew and 8 not not_available on SuperCrew i Body Style i Two Flareside and Styleside availability dependent on both cab configuration and bed length This latter is very noticeable on the flareside which is pretty much the same idea as Chevys stepside bed Naturally the tail end has undergone a little change too mostly in the shape of the taillights All tailgates are removable and locking and I found them surprisingly light for a hunk of metal that large this may be the tailgate assist feature which no salesman could explain Oh yeah the cab is about an acre in area large enough that for average sized me reaching some controls even in the center of the dashboard was a bit of a stretch Where they ve done best is in the cosmetics especially the amount of attention lavished on the interior and in the across the board inclusion of four doors on the cab And when you come right down to it eight years is a long time to go without a redesign even for trucks vehicles that generally have precious little wiggle room for design Unless you spring for the pricey captains chairs and floor mounted shifter the column mounted shifter makes access to the ignition a bit awkward Buttons for the optional cruise control are on the face of the steering wheel always a plus in my book If a potential driver is on the short side you may wish to spring for the optional power adjustable pedal cluster standard on Lariat All trims and cabs have tilt steering an instrument panel with speedometer odometer fuel voltmeter temperature gauges and manual lumbar support The rails which include transmission of power for a DVD screen or speaker and climate controls are finished in brushed aluminum they re incompatible however with the optional power moonroof Did Ford do the job No question about it yes Driving Interface Ford bought out a new 4 speed electronic overdrive automatic the only tranny available Errr excuse me Ford but how come you havent been able to come up with a 5 speed I thought you were working on innnovation But change they did the company boasts that they ve touched on every system in the vehicle in an effort to make the 2004 redesign total and from where I sit it looks like they have But again we must ask The sound system controls are high on the dash keep your eyes on the road bud and seem marginally larger than those of the previous year Climate control knobs and buttons face directly rearward at the center of the dashboard potentially a stretch for short armed drivers This is troubling since Ford certainly knows how to install them in their other vehicles including the Excursion and an optional canopy system offered in the a href content 77758566020 Expedition a Go figure Did Ford do the job No Where are the side airbags the traction control Line at the Bottom They re slightly shorter and wider than in the previous design and the hideous teardrop shaped lenses on the flareside have been dropped in favor of the same light housings used on the styleside BTW while I once called the flaresides taillights the ugliest ever mounted on a pickup truck that was before I saw the lights on a Tundra stepside They were smart to drop the V6 but I think dumb to drop the manual tranny the updated automatic transmission may be an improvement but its not not_particularly not_noticeable A couple of points stand out in my overview of the model update first how come Ford cant not_seem not_to not_come not_up not_with not_a not_broader not_range not_of not_powertrain not_options In fact the hood now includes the grille which may come as a painful surprise for tall owners the first few times they check their crankcase oil Stroll down the length of the body and you ll note that all F 150s now have a notched front window like the big guys and the door handles arent the old Ford ovals but beefy looking square pads with wraparound handles Its my feeling that Ford just didnt not_quite not_leap not_far not_enough not_forward not_with not_the not_update not_Sure not_they not_ve not_stayed not_ahead not_of not_or not_even not_with not_the not_GMC not_and not_Dodge not_offerings but those footsteps with a Japanese accent are

not_for not_sure not_after not_I not_ve not_finished not_testing not_a not_new not_Tundra but right now I m not not_overly not_impressed not_by not_the not_model not_change Truth be told the F 150

not_i not_Bed not_Length not_i On the face of it not not_a not_thing was really wrong with the a href content 109971934852 2003 F 150 a a vehicle that came in so many configurations and trims that the only thing they seemed to have in common was a grille shaped like a Cameron Diaz smile Its that the competition especially the Tundra had started doing things better Fords 1996 redesign of the line stuck with a clunky dual leaf spring rear suspension that while friendly to full loads of cargo is less kind to passengers kidneys They feel solid too and the model I drove had even better build quality than that 2003 already good Power windows in both the front and rear for SuperCrew and SuperCab are standard in XLT FX4 and Lariat trims but in the XL and STX trims the rear windows are fixed

The breakover point for cushiness appears to be between the STX and the XLT the upper three trims have a standard tach power front and rear windows and cruise control the two lower trims have optional cruise control Climbing into the cab is made a bit easier by a pair of grab handles though I found them located awkwardly far to the front Once seated high above the madding crowd in the cab you ll find that for the most part the instrument panel is well laid out and intuitive I found the standard bench seat a bit deep and it could use a little more contouring to the average posterior shape as its rather flat But the proof is in the driving and to tell the truth its bit tough to tell that anythings been updated in some arenas Acceleration isnt not_particularly not_impressive not_try

opening doors for improved access to the enlarged cubby behind the front seats Did Ford do the job Yes to the four doors no to the body redesign cheaters Notes From the Interior Ford lavished more attention to the interior of the F 150 With as much landscape as is available there what an acre or two they had plenty of room to play All basic amenities are present standard AC dash mounted cupholders with more in the flip down console for bench seats a pair of power points one on the passenger side of the dash and a surprisingly puny glove compartment Map pockets are incised into all doors with integrated cutouts in the front doors for bottle holders Me I just took the first truck I happened upon in the dealers lot an STX 2WD SuperCab with the standard 4 6L engine and a couple of options cruise control and the towing package For those of you keeping track it was black with a gray technically medium flint interior Looks Count For Something Face it A truck is a truck is a truck From the outside at least a pickup is just a naked box on wheels with a bit of covered space where a driver can sit Except for the badging and taillight shapes pickups are fairly hard to tell apart in silhouette though from the front the grille shape quickly gives em away Still Ford has managed to apply some cosmetic changes to the previous version resulting in a model thats distinguishable even to one whos not not_a not_Ford not_enthusiast Compared to the previous model a walkaround will show that Ford has dumped the raked streamlined shape of the front end that was so reminiscent of early Taurus models Instead they ve essentially recreated the body style of the F 150s beefier siblings the F 250 and F 350 Up front the headlights are more squared and that grinning grille takes a bite out

bit complacent for after its 1996 update the F 150 slowly lost ground to GMs Silverado twins and the Dodge Ram Updates to those two 1999 for the Silverado 2002 for the Ram further encroached on the F 150s lead but the biggest scare for Dearborn came in 2000 when Toyota morphed its undersized T100 into a true full sized truck the Tundra Combining the nearly legendary reliability of Toyotas truck line with a full size truck was certain to take a bite out of Fords sales and slip they did Adding more fear and loathing is the promise of another Japanese full size entry the Nissan Titan promised for this model year Ford couldnt help but hear ever louder footsteps Fortunately for the folks at the blue oval a rebuild from wheels to the tip of the antenna was in the cards for the 2004 model year and faced with slipping sales of 2003s For a truck this size minimum length 211 maximum 249 handling is relatively sprightly but beware the huge turning radius when its time for parking Handling is better for this vehicle than others I ve driven in its class although I m waiting to get my hands on a 2004 Tundra and have yet to drive the latest version of the Ram I ll let you know Still and all the ride is certainly an improvement over the punishing kidney bashing ride of even ten years ago Looks like the influx of drugstore cowboys seeking that cool pickup truck look has had an upside after all Sound wise this F150 is about the same as last years minor engine noise and low to moderate wind and road noise Did Ford do the job A qualified maybe they dumped the wimpy V6 and improved the suspension and steering but I m unvconvinced that the improvement is enough to leapfrog the competition I also miss manual trannies Safety All F 150s come with two dual stage front airbags a passenger side deactivation switch is provided for Regular Cabs Front seatbelts which are integrated into the body of the seat are equipped with pretensioners and an energy management system all outboard seating positions have three point harnesses as does the rear center position in SuperCrews and SuperCabs LATCH points are standard All configurations have standard four wheel disc brakes with ABS and side intrusion door beams Side airbags are not not_available not_even not_as not_an not_option not_neither not_is not_a not_side not_curtain not_system The white on black instrument panel is clear and easy to read note that Lariat trims have a ritzier black on offwhite look Besides the gauges theres also a set of idiot lights for all the usual warnings Lariat drivers will find one of those ultra cool and occasionally distracting information centers with readouts of time distance fuel economy etc tucked beneath the voltmeter and oil pressure gauge Did Ford do the job Ummm not not_really its pretty much the same layout and interface as the 2003 with a continuation of reach and access problems especially for smaller drivers Time for the Driving Experience Ford must ve listened to me last time around they ve dumped the underpowered V6 engine that was standard in the last model run Rumors say it will return next year but I ll bet its no longer a wimpy 202 hp Mind you they havent offered a new standard engine just dropped the little one Now standard is the 4 6L Triton SOHC V8 that was optional last year which generates 231 hp and 293 lb ft of torque Last years 5 4L V8 has undergone a major workover bulking up to 300 hp and 365 lb ft Much of the work on this engine introducing variable valve timing and three valves per cylinder was intended to boost both power and torque low in the RPM range Ford claims that the engine delivers over 290 lb ft of torque at 1000 RPM just barely above an idle Comparison of last years model specs with this years though shows that the 2004s are are about a five inches longer and 300 500 pounds heavier across the board which tends to dampen my enthusiasm for any increases in power Manual transmissions went the way of the V6 engine no word on whether they ll return For 2004
Pos,Thats standard Also belt minder system encourages safety belt use The Ford 150 series can only get better The company wants to innovate with the 2004 pickup too The split port induction system tends to optimize fuel efficiency and engine response It appears that all his fathers trucks have been a F 150 over the years This is a truck that has withstood times and economic hardships It appears that Ford can only continue to improve its well known crown jewels There are three trim series that are available on the SuperCab models XL XLT and Lariat What I have found to be the enduring values of this great vehicle are its practicality and strength This truck has come handy on the farm Many construction workers purchase them too Its great to carry cargo To help secure your cargo tie down hooks are located in each corner of all F 150 cargo boxes No wonder that I had a ball when test driving and working with this truck on the farm In fact many industry insiders will admit that the F series has saved Ford company when it hits hard times Very few trucks are that responsive when you need them to It comes with a four speed automatic overdrive transmission To provide you with comfort the designers place a rear step bumper that gives easy access to the cargo area It offers so much comfort and cargo carrying capacity that most buyers end up comparing it with its main competitors on the market The tailgate can be removed for special loading duties How about the trucks powertrain F 150 SuperCab 4 2 liter OHV V 6 engine produces 202 horsepower and 252 foot pounds of torque Way before I got interested into writing about cars the F series has been Americas best selling truck Its been like that for more than 25 years This way you wont have to drive long and short distances without putting on your belts Remote keyless entry offers added convenience and security at night by activating the interior lights This year the Ford 150 sounds quieter and more refined thanks to a 75 part noise vibration and harshness upgrade From what I can remember the 2003 F 150 SuperCrew drives so much better than its predecessors Other features include air conditioning overhead console power windows with delayed accessory power and one touch down drivers window power locks tilt steering wheel speed control and power moonroof Electronic automatic temperature control is standard on the truck In addition you will find out that the cargo light on the back of the cab makes loading and unloading the truck box very easy at night Ford designs this truck with the owner user in mind It goes without saying that on our local freeways and highways you will find an F 150 truck out of every 3 truck I had never given much attention to the truck until I started spending more time on a friends farm It continues to deliver power and durability in the line of full size pickups Based on the 2003 F series I just cant not_wait not_to not_test not_drive not_the not_2004 not_F not_series not_which not_has not_caused not_so not_much not_hoopla not_so not_far How handy this features has come especially when you have to park away from the lighted parking lot In the fields of California we sometimes have to leave our trucks for very long periods of time Final thoughts The short and long arm independent fron suspension enhances my ride and handling All in all it was quite a smooth ride I was amazed by its handling For the driver and passenger the truck is equipped with air bag supplemental restraint system There is also the side door intrusion beams that help protect passengers or occupants in the case of a side door impact or accident Countless lives may have been saved thanks to this upgrade LATCH child safety seat tethers are standard equipment on the F 150 trucks If you have not not_gotten not_a not_Ford not_you not_can not_wait not_for not_the not_2004 not_truck not_I not_dont not_necessarily not_trust not_other not_Ford not_vehicles but after working with the F series I would invite anybody to give it a try Why should you buy the a href content 104412515972 2004 Toyota Sienna a Find out more It makes sense that they end up purchasing this truck for the type of package and value Taking a look at its interior Some of the features that you will find on this truck include the following standard power adjustable pedals power moonroof and a functional bed extender in case you want to increase the box length for carrying longer items Thats an option that the owner wanted With so many packages that are available out there on these trucks you can have anything that you want as long as you can afford it This is true in the case of the towing and payload ratings of the F 150 tester With all those statistics how did I feel driving the truck i Ride handling safety and security issues FYI All F 150 trucks come equipped with a four wheel anti lock braking system
Pos,This may not not_be not_accurate not_for not_all not_types not_of not_Cherokees This is due to the size of the vehicle rather then the steering Ok so maybe Econoline Vans arent for everyone especially if you live in the city With good miles to the gallon and an extremely good ride it is well worth the money If you are however one who likes the travel then this is the perfect car for your needs The only reason I say this fact is because I recall my mother and my uncle comparing gas mileage prices The steering is very good the only difficulty with the handling is getting used to the size of the vehicle Why Should Someone Buy One These Like I said earlier the Econoline is not not_for not_everyone And the econoline was better then the jeep How Is The Handling Of An Econoline Although I very seldom use the econoline for my personal driving the few times ive used it I noticed that it is a difficult vehicle to manuever in tight situations If you arent someone that lives in the city and you like to drive long distances on vacations then this vehicle is for you Whats The Interior Of The Econoline Like Well one way to explain this question is by comparing the interior of an econoline to that of an airplane that is first class The seats are very comfortable and my particular model is equipped with gadgets galore A plug in vacuum a TV and VCP a mechanical bed that turns into a back seat a 10 disc CD Changer and much more With power AC a ride to my grandparents house in Florida is very comfortable Whats The Mile Per Gallon On The Econoline Although I am very seldom a driver of my econoline since my parents do most of the driving I do know that the Econoline gets better miles to the gallon then that of a Jeep Grand Cherokee Note
Pos,But this car cruises the highway very comfortably The car is not not_only reliable but is very sexy We test drove a Mitsubishi Eclipse Chevy Monte Carlo Mazda RX 7 Ford Probe and Eagle Talon Last year we decided to trade our family car for a sports car We shopped around before deciding on what car to purchase The fit and finish on my Mustang is great Everything lines up and looks good We went out of town to a car dealer to look and test drive more models We checked everything on the car inside and out and we decided to purchase All the ones that we test drove were around the same year and handled relatively the same We have done routine maintenance on the car and that has kept this Stang in great working order The engine in my Ford Mustang is a little short on power but it will do for me My hubby loves this car because it is one of the few that is still rear wheel drive Even though we have experienced a few minor problems I would still highly recommend the Ford Mustang to anyone wanting a good cruising car However the dash and all the plastic molding on the inside do rattle and squeak but I will deal with this little annoyance because I love the car so much We already had a Chevy Lumina so we decided it was time to get rid of the unreliable Grand Am and go to a sporty car He likes the fact that the engine is sitting in the car the way it should be In other words he can work on the car easily The mounting pads in the strut tower tend to squeak really bad on bumps Obviously all Ford Mustangs are like this because my husband had an 87 model that done the same thing It has a muscular stance and does not not_look not_like not_a not_catfish not_coming not_down not_the not_road not_like not_the not_Chevy not_Camaro not_I not_am not_not not_knocking not_the not_Camaro not_because not_it not_is not_a not_great not_car not_too not_but not_mine not_just not_looks not_better not_LOL But I will admit it is not not_great not_for not_when not_kids not_are not_involved not_A not_rear not_facing not_car not_seat not_will not_not not_fit not_into not_the not_small not_back not_seat not_I not_now not_use not_a not_front not_facing not_car not_seat not_and not_do not_not not_have not_any not_problems It does get good gas mileage if I keep my foot out of it In curves I really do not not_like not_the not_way not_it not_handles not_I not_had not_a not_Saturn not_2 not_door not_coupe not_that not_would not_whip not_it not_in not_curves not_as not_far not_as not_handling not_goes The only major problem that we have experienced with the car is the check engine light coming on The flap in the gas tank sticking open and not not_building not_up not_enough not_fuel not_pressure not_caused not_this not_Once not_we not_took not_it not_to not_a not_dealer not_and not_had not_the not_problem not_corrected not_we not_have not_not not_had not_any not_more not_problems We got it for a steal at 12 500 After having the car for almost a year I still love it as much as the day we bought it Well that is a little exaggerated because we have had a few small problems but overall it is still great At the third dealer we came to we told the sales person what we were looking for and the price range and he immediately directed us to a lonely Ford Mustang just waiting to be brought home by some lucky person Without delay we test drove this car This Mustang is a 1997 LX V6 Automatic with power windows power door locks CD stereo system dual air bags and power drivers seat While looking this car over we discovered that it only had 15 000 original miles on the odometer
Pos,The car drives like a DREAM Only thing is this is NOT a family car But its well worth every penny of it It gets great gas mileage high speed and of course it looks awesome The front seats give you plenty of leg room and you can be very comfortable But i must say the back seat area must of been designed for kids only its rather small and crampy I highly suggest it for anyone Insurance can be a real pain in the rear end though owning a mustang means outrageous insurance people If you are looking for a new car for sure go with the Ford Mustang ive had my 97 cherry red ford mustang for a little over 31 2 years now and its the best car i have ever owned If you have young children who still use car seats this is most likely not not_the not_car for you ive tried numerous times to fit a carseat in the backseat and still have the passenger in my car comfortable with enough room needless to say it never worked out What I love about this car is that i have had basically NO problems with it whatsoever Never had to take it to the shop new tires put on nothing Its a very HIGH quality car
Pos,The fit and finish is fine I bought my Mustang GT 1 year ago It will be stored for the winter It was a low mile V8 convertible I absolutely love it A very fun car The styling is great better than the 99s and 2 Ks and much nicer than the earlier boxy style This car will never see snow ice and salt A friend has a BMW 3 series convertible Sorry dollar for dollar no comparison to my pony It did have some acid rain damage from the previous owner A trip to the body shop and 300 later solved 95 of the problem The car is black and I am very fussy Its a bit noisy with the top up while on the highway but heck its a convertible The leather seats are very comfortable I love getting into it The 4 6L engine and 5 speed transmission are super Plenty of power Nice sounding stock dual exhaust I use the car mostly on weekends as a fun car The BMW is a high tech high priced sterile car The Mustang is an all American muscle car I could see buying a 6 cylinder coupe as a family or second car although rear wheel traction would be a problem in winter
Pos,The power locks windows and seats are a luxury that I have grown to appreciate All in all I suggest this car for anyone who doesnt have children usually drives alone and wants a good looking car The front seats are very comfortable and with being only 4 11 tall the power up button on the seats makes driving very comfortable However as for any sports car the backseat is perfect for holding my backpack shopping bags and purse but not not_my not_friends As my 16th birthday rolled around the dream of owning a hot set of wheels became more prominent in my blonde little head I knew nothing about cars engines etc but I did know that I loved the color purple This 1997 V6 Mustang that sat at a local dealer was very much purple and is now very much mine My boyfriend who is a die hard Chevy man warned me about the car but now has grown to love it almost as much as me As far as power goes the V6 is all I will ever need although it may be a little sluggish for some power hungry people I adore the color a bright vibrant purple that I can only find in 97 Stangs and I think the light grey interior is tasteful The gas cap can be slightly awkward as I recall being at a filling station 30 minutes away from home the needle on E bawling to my boyfriend on my cell phone that I couldnt figure it out Once I got the hang of it there hasnt been any problems since Speaking of gas it gets around 25 mpg when I drive it in town and about 18 mpg when my bf drives it Although ive been told that Mustangs are a dime a dozen I take pride in the fact that I drive a new model of an original classic car I also take pride in the stares I receive when I drive down the road I also like the fact that aftermarket parts are so easy to find so fixing one up is a breeze
Pos,I am originally from NYC The Sport Trac definitely makes a statement about ones personality and a taste The best part is the bed This sure comes in handy The sound system alone blows most cars off the road Equipped with not not_only standard speakers This four door pickup truck easily accommodates four 6 ft men Fully powered Even the automatic rear window is great feature Air conditioning is great I spent tow in in Charleston SC and it get hot down there Not only that you think parrallel parking would be difficult especially in NYC I have put this baby in some spaces Ford went way out on this ride by combining the comfort of the SUV EXPLORER and F150 Truck to come up with a ride both woman and men could take pleasure This ride roars with bottom BASS Just like a night club with all the windows rolled up and volume at set at half sounds heard outside the car are crystal clear Long distance driving is a breeze Comfortable and great on gas Switch 2 to 4 wheel drive high or low in a breeze No one there drive as pickup primary car The Explorer Sport Trac breaks all the rule and whenever I drive my ride home people stop and ask me so many questions about this good looking ride Never in a million years did I think I would ever be caught in a pickup Of course it is larger than a car trunk put smaller than a standard size bed However you can fit most anything in there I purchased this vehicle last October 2001 for my birthday and what I love most is this is simply a great looking all around multi purpose truck that I am proud to take anywhere whether it to the supermarket or waiting valet attendant This SUV MPV Pick up truck turns heads and burns rubber when I have to
Pos,Theres not not_much not_middle not_ground Id do it again Turn signals quietly tock tock tock The fabric seats are well cushioned and supportive It is adjustable in three different ways Is the 2000 Ford Focus a well equipped comfortable economy car Absolutely The suspension absorbs irregularities in the road very effectively The standard 2000 Ford Focus SE sedan costs 13 660 MSRP 12 716 invoice This car is really a pleasure to drive So what does 16 000 get you these days The destination fee is 465 and the manufacturer determined advertising fee is 130 The hydraulically opening trunk is shockingly quiet as are the doors Id recommend this car to others Bang for the Buck The SE sedan looks very similar to a Volkswagon Jetta with ugly and unmistakable triangular headlights Put simply it starts stops and turns very comfortably and easily No question about it this is a very comfortable car for its class You dont not_feel not_vulnerable not_in not_this not_car not_like not_you not_might not_in not_some not_other not_small not_car My friends Saturn has a much louder engine Silly little things To each his own Frankly I dont not_select not_a not_car not_based not_strictly not_on not_aesthetics The glove box is huge But in the end thats what I ended up with My sister is happy im happy Theres a pen holder next to the drivers seat The ASPCA advises against this however It took me a while to learn to accept the headlights I admit With all the hype about the 2000 Ford Focus you d think that Ford was giving away rocketships This is particularly important because my sister and I differ in height by six or seven inches Adjustable steering wheel Also very relevant to me since I wanted to finance this car is Ford Credits attractive financing rate If adjusting the seat isnt not_enough not_the not_steering not_wheel not_can not_be not_adjusted not_up not_down not_or not_in not_out not_with not_the not_tilt not_telescoping not_properties The small diameter steering wheel has comfortable swollen grips on it and the steering is accurate and easy Braking is similarly responsive You can easily fit a novel instead of just a magazine in these slots The back is sufficiently spacious for two passengers especially kids Adjustable drivers seat Related to the above is the drivers seat itself If you have a lot of favorite radio stations thats a nice feature She doesnt drag race Nor does she haul a horse trailer transport Scout troops or need to make a socioeconomic statement with her vehicle You could fit a Taco Bell dog in there along with your owners manual You hear it rev when you accelerate but its never not_loud enough to interfere with conversation The storage slots on the inside of the front doors for holding maps and such are really wide The owners manual comes in a nice little zippered storage case that looks sophisticated The big obtrusive front headrests and car frame itself further impede visibility rearward But some of it seems senseless to me These two fees are supposed to be non negotiable Adding all this up gives a figure ranging from 16 415 MSRP figures to 15 235 invoice figures In spite of some of the literature that suggests that the car is underpowered my experience is that it is very zippy Is it the dawning of a new era of Euro styled ergonomically attuned New Edge globally conceived econovehicles or whatever the marketing gobbledegook says Uh I dunno The back of the seat can recline as much as you need it to The seat can be pulled closer to or further away from the steering wheel Um these things look like furry business envelopes It has accurately been described as chairlike or mini van SUV like inside Legs hang comfortably and one views the road from a taller vantage The fact that I can do it at all is wonderful but the fact that it didnt not_cost not_me not_a not_small not_fortune not_as not_an not_option not_is not_even not_better Whether someone is short or tall small or large I believe that they d be able to make the necessary adjustments to be totally comfortable in this car Handling The turn signal control is on the left side of the steering wheel Take a look Go for a test drive This is another area where one can save a few dollars with this vehicle Form Embodies Function Either you think that the 2000 Ford Focus is attractive or you dont There are two great big cupholders in front with removable liners that can be easily cleaned Gripes Visibility One of the things I like best about that is that it makes them easy to vacuum clean The brochure for this car is ugly and contains almost no information In my area the best credit union offered a 7 APR on 4 year auto loans Currently Ford offers 5 9 for the same loan 4 9 for 3 year loans and 6 9 for 5 year loans Do your homework at Edmunds www edmunds com and other online sites Be clear about what you want in a car In most cars I ve driven the windshield wipers are located on the same stalk Not in this car Also keep in mind that some people have had problems with these cars My neighborhood is rotten with potholes and road construction at the moment and yet I barely feel any lumps and bumps in this car Even though its a small car I could travel a distance in it with ease In any case I ll update this as needed to reflect my gripes and concerns Warnings That part is a little over my head but it sounds overstated Its just a car but its a good car Mission Affordable I wanted to purchase a new car for my sister for her birthday im no millionaire and her needs are simple By contrast I jump a foot in the air when the doors automatically lock as I drive away Thats loud Again in spite of reports to the contrary I have not not_found not_that not_the not_engine not_is not_excessively not_noisy Id buy it again Hopefully it will stand the test of time The side mirrors compensate for this however Illogical controls Most of the controls are clearly labelled and for the most part I have no complaint This is the biggest drawback to the Focus With a hood that arcs sharply downward it is virtually impossible to see the front of the car She just needs to commute to work and get to wherever else she needs to go It would be nice if her butt didnt not_go not_numb and if she didnt not_explode not_into not_flames not_in not_the not_process There are special hooks in the back seat to attach car seats for little ones I dont not_have not_kids but if I did that would be a big plus The windshield wiper control is a separate stalk on the right side of the steering wheel Why This particular departure from convention annoys me Fuel gauge If you want an economy car that is comfortable and well equipped at least consider a 2000 Ford Focus And the seat can be raised and lowered I love the latter feature Some writers have complained about the simple crank mechanism that raises or lowers the seat but I consider it refreshing to have a non electronic means to adjust the seat But I suspect that with age if either of these things got quirky it would be expensive to fix them Rear floor mats This makes the 2000 Ford Focus SE sedan an affordable car but not not_the not_least not_expensive not_car

invoice anti lock brakes 400 MSRP 356 invoice My sister used to be a firm Ford hater but she loves this car If I had it to do over The shape of the car is functional to be sure Because it is tall for its size it gives the illusion of being a larger car Seats are set high enough that one doesnt feel like their knees are bumping the handlebars when seated It is easy to get in and out of because the seats are rump level I found that the back seat is especially comfortable in this regard Similarly the elevated height makes it easy to access the trunk without a lot of bending and stretching What I like about this car Roominess Take a look at the town hall at Edmunds www edmunds com and or the message board at Club Focus www discussion board com clubfocus to see what others have had to say Bottom line As discussed above the car feels a lot bigger than it is In addition to head and leg room the trunk is cavernous Both back seats can be folded to offer even more cargo area I expect a small car to feel small so the roomy feel to this small car is a really nice surprise Comfort The unknown Reliability Nobody knows plain and simple I purchase a car with the intention of putting 150 000 miles on it and keeping it for ten years or more I hope this car carries me there One can visit Fords official website www fordvehicles com for all the specifics but this includes such standard features as dual air bags air conditioning am fm radio with cassette power locks and mirrors remote keyless entry securilock passive anti theft system panic alarm 24 hour roadside assistance 15 wheels

American label economy cars and I admit that thats what im partial to I looked at a number of comparable cars Chevrolet Cavalier Dodge Plymouth Neon Saturns series Ford Escort etc I had never even

If you order your Ford Focus be aware that they take forever to arrive I was promised mine in 6 10 weeks and it showed up 14 weeks later Judging by what other people say the average wait is about 12 weeks You get a feel for where it is but Id hate to have to parallel park this thing Its not not_a not_car not_for not_tailgaters not_or not_big not_city not_parking for that reason Similarly the cars rump is elevated so its difficult to see where you re going when you back up The radio faceplate can be removed easily so that the radio is rendered functionless if its stolen I dont not_know not_who not_would not_steal not_the not_factory not_radio not_out not_of not_an not_economy not_car nor do I know who would worry about it getting stolen but hey its one of those fun things to show your friends Worth noting the radio allows you to preset 6 am and 12 fm stations What is Ford trying to tell me By contrast the am fm switch on the radio is microscopic and situated way to the right side of the radio I ve learned where it is but I still have to take my eyes off of the road to find it Am I the only person who finds this irritating Windshield wiper controls Although the target market is young 20ish 30ish women the sales pitch is gimmicky and yuppified in tone with lots of irritating buzzwords bandied about Anybody who uses the term ergonomic should be run over with a Hummer Ironically all the hype stresses how European this car is I ve always owned American cars I like American cars Dont tell me that my Michigan built Ford is European dammit Its a turn off The hazard light switch is the single most prominent feature on the dashboard Its a huge orange triangle that begs to be pushed im in my thirties and I ve never had the need to turn on the hazard lights in any car I ve driven Even when the switch is less obvious I ve always known where it was but I ve never needed to use it Why on Earth is it so prominent in this vehicle
Pos,What a great car and some great ways to improve it even more There are also tons of ground effects kits from West Wings and others Think about some nice cosmetic goodies also a duck tail rally car style wing check out http www focaljet com for group buys The sky is the limit from there Check out the websites mentioned above for great tech articles also There are also a ton of 17 wheels that are fairly cheap that look great like the Konig Monsoon Lower the car to improve the handling and appearance try the coil overs if you can afford it but just a solid set of lowering springs should do fine for all but the most serious competitior try H amp Rs WHEELS some people use the Contour SVT 16 wheels my personal favorite while others have used the Cougar 16 wheels both of these fit great since the bolt pattern is shared The one from http www focussport com has a great exhaust note and is relatively easy to put on you will have to cut the stock exhaust off however Next go for an underdrive pulley which will free up a few horsepower A performance chip is always an easy way to increase power sometimes by as much as 20 hp If you re really serious about more horsepower there are actually turbo kits available as well What a pleasant surprise to have Ford build an affordable cool well sorted domestic pocket rocket and then to have so many bolt on performance parts available after only a year To start out with the ZX3 has a racing history in the FIA World Rally Championship WRC Drivers Colin McRae and Carlos Sainz are trying to capture the manufacturers title this year Anyway your ZX3 likely did not not_get not_the not_Rally not_Option not_with not_the not_230 not_hp not_motor but you ll be pleased to learn that you can come real close to that with some carefully chosen bolt on goodies disclaimer these upgrades may invalidate your warranty do your homework before modifying your new car Start with a K amp N air filter if you want to keep a stealth stock look or you could opt for one of the umpteen gazillion cold air induction kits Next you ll want an aftermarket exhaust to let everything breate a little easier
Pos,To tell you the truth the 5 spd is REALLY zippy Now this is not not_to not_say not_the not_car not_hasnt not_had not_problems The really good news is a lot of the bugs have since been worked out with the 2001s The interior is great easy to get to everything and doesnt look feel cheap for the inexpensive amount you paid the leather wrapped steering wheel is a nice touch And the cornering is awesome for a little Ford Take it on a test drive hopefully without the sales person JUST so you can take those corners FAST you ll see Added bonus PARKING It has The brake pads and rotors were replaced at 4 000 miles I am at 13 000 no probs since and of course the re have been recalls Mine was only affected by one recall I decided to put some fun in my commute 120 miles a day roundtrip when I decided to buy a new car Enter the Ford Focus ZX3 MY FIRST NEW CAR MAIN REASONS TO BUY I bought it because its great handling decent fuel economy price and over all fun ness to drive I know fun ness is very subjective but trust me take a ZX3 for a test drive you ll see If you live in a city where parking is at a premium you can squeeze into those tiny spots while the envious Monster SUV owners have no choice but to cruise on by N Side of Chicago especially INTERIOR So I knew what I could get for how much without paying too much over sticker I wound up paying exactly the invoice price for my new silver ZX3 5 spd with AC and tilt wheel with navigator options THE DRIVE No problems with brakes since 13 K but still worried about them Still handles well although gas milage seems to be dipping I used to get about 32 MPG mostly highway now I average about 27 MPG It wont beat a Corvette or anything on a jack rabbit stop light start but it really cruises along best at highway speeds I often look down at the speedometer to unknowingly be going 80 The ZX3 is very easy to negotiate through all kinds of traffic with good stopping power So before you buy make sure you find out how good the service IS in the service department Overall Some problems are to be expected if you want to be the first kid on the block with the cool new toy such is the case with the 2000 Ford Focus ZX3 The back seat is VERY roomy Every time someone gets back there they always say something about how much room there is AND most of these people drive full sized cars and are used to room ADDED BONUS Leather wrapped steering wheel Fog Lights CD Player Are ALL standard THE NOT SO GREAT These are actually things I can deal with but considering my service dept where I bought the car sucks it makes it even more difficult to deal with these problems I expected to have some probs DID NOT expect the service to suck as much as it does It was my first NEW car ever and I didnt not_want not_to not_throw not_my not_money not_away not_I not_researched not_very not_carefully not_I not_looked not_at not_the not_obvious not_in not_its not_class not_ish not_Honda not_reliable not_but not_dull not_Toyota not_Echo not_see not_my not_other not_review not_way not_too not_many not_cons not_VW not_too not_much not_money not_for not_not not_enough not_car not_and not_some not_others not_I not_went not_to not_each not_dealer not_armed not_with not_TONS not_of not_information not_off not_the not_internet not_with not_stats not_and not_INVOICE not_pricing not_on not_each not_car not_I not_knew not_exactly not_what not_each not_car not_cost not_the not_dealer not_at not_its not_INVOICE not_price Just because you have to buy economy doesnt mean you have to feel like you re driving an econo box see the Toyota Echo Ford Focus ZX3 you get a lot of car for not not_a not_lot of money Note Why revised Because I wrote this before I knew at Epinions I simply wrote it at first to tell everyone in the market what a great car this was I didnt not_even not_know not_what not_Epinions not_was not_The not_revisions not_have not_cleared not_up not_some not_of not_the not_format not_to not_be not_more not_Epinion not_friendly not_Thanks not_revised not_June not_2001 not_Update not_32 not_000 not_miles not_in not_one not_year not_so not_far not_so not_good not_Warrenty not_will not_be not_up not_soon
Pos,Yes the engine The exterior of the Focus has yet to grow on me If they could fit the 6 cylinder from the contour in this car it would be an absolute blast My sister purchased a new Ford Focus Hatchback ZX3 and I have had the chance to drive it around a ton The ergonomics of the instruments are good everything is in the right place and is easy to use Now that I have ranted and raved about this car are there any downsides you ask The Zetec 4 cylinder is zippy but does not not_have not_the not_punch not_you not_need not_for not_merging not_into not_highway not_traffic As a matter of fact with a little refinement the Focus build quality will be comparable to Honda and other Japanese companies The great part about the interior is the build quality it is much better than the escorts poorly built interior That is not not_to not_say not_it not_isnt not_sufficient not_it not_just not_doesnt not_match not_the not_ability not_of not_the not_suspension not_system You also may notice the included air bags at no extra cost a very responsible move by Ford that I appreciate This car is more fun than anyone could imagine from looking at it The steering is crisp gives good feedback and can SERIOUSLY corner Body roll was a little excessive but still much better than 90 of American made cars Back to the interior theres really not not_a not_lot not_to not_say not_Obviously not_since not_it not_is not_a not_cheap not_car not_it not_is not_very not_basic This car could also catch on with the tuner crowd also and if I was gonna build a boy racer this would probably be the car I started with it has the goods to be amazing This is one GREAT car The idea behind the Focus is to make a safe reliable and fun car that can be had in three body styles hatchback sedan and wagon I was personally expecting Ford to build a mediocre compact similar to the escort but they certainly outdid themselves with this car The other downside is the suspension can be a little stiff at times more than it could or should be Some may also say the styling is a major problem but I think if you get behind the wheel the styling will be forgiven The car puts up slalom and skidpad numbers that rival cars such as the Camaro and Firebird Now that is impressive for a compact that rounds out at 15000 I felt very sure of the cars footing and felt as if I had total control of the car at all times The weird part about it is I cant not_stop not_driving not_this not_little not_car not_i not_love not_it not_Now not_I not_know not_that not_is not_weird not_to not_say not_about not_a not_Ford not_especially not_their not_affordable not_compact but its true Ford has put together one of if not not_the not_best not_small not_cars on the market My sister has not not_had not_the not_car not_long not_enough not_to not_see not_if not_it not_will not_be not_reliable not_or not_not not_but not_it not_seems not_that not_it not_will not_be not_Those not_are not_the not_only not_gripes not_and not_for not_a not_car not_this not_price not_that not_is not_amazing not_Ford not_has not_put not_together not_exactly not_what not_they not_wanted not_to not_create not_and not_they not_definitely not_did not_not not_forget not_the not_fun You would think a car so tall would be washy on the road but this thing can be tossed around I was so surprised that at first I didnt not_believe not_it not_I not_thought not_it not_was not_more not_of not_an not_illusion not_than not_reality not_so not_I not_looked not_up not_the not_Focus not_statistics not_in not_Car not_and not_Driver not_and not_I not_wasnt not_wrong The one thing about the car that sets it apart though is its shape especially the hatchback people always seem confused on what they think about the car when they see it The exterior of the car is not not_where not_the not_beauty not_is not_as not_a not_matter not_of not_fact not_the not_interior not_isnt not_much not_better not_the not_beauty not_of not_the not_car not_starts not_behind not_the not_wheel It seems tall oddly shaped and misproportioned I am starting to get used to the new edge styling that Ford is employing but I am not not_convinced not_that not_it not_makes not_a not_good not_looking not_or not_striking not_car not_if not_anything not_it not_makes not_the not_car not_less not_striking not_and not_more not_boring not_If not_this not_car not_had not_clean not_sleek not_lines not_I not_think not_Ford not_would not_have not_had not_an not_even not_bigger not_winner not_than not_they not_have not_Overall not_for not_the not_money not_the not_exterior not_is not_solidly not_built not_and not_in not_its not_own not_way not_sporty
Pos,The radio even can adjust its sound level automatically to deal with ambient noise The telescoping steering wheel was a big plus since I did have to tilt the driver side seat back At the age of 40 I found myself in the market for a commuter car when we decided to give our old one to a relative As it had been some time until I had looked at an entry level car it was with some trepidation that I approached a dealer lot to look at the Ford Focus About the only option I would have like to have added was the side impact air bags which are available a rarity in a car of this class im 6 6 and have a pretty wide body but the seats are quite supportive and the head room excellent All in all if you re looking for a small fun inexpensive well built and cute car you d do worse than to test drive the Ford Focus Also available but not not_reviewed are several models of sedan with differing trim levels SE LX ZTS a station wagon SE and a couple of custom models including the Sony and I think one featuring a Trek bicycle and rack with a unique color called Dirt Then again ive had to do that in much larger cars handling is fairly crisp especially for an American small car but overall ride quality is quite decent as is road noise Fit and finish is excellent comparable to small Japanese cars Ford has hit the nail on the head with this award winning world car or at least come closer than they have before to producing a small car that can take on the Hondas and Toyota small models The only inconveniences are small ones For a 130 hp 130 ft lb torque engine the automatic transmission ratios do not not_seem not_terribly not_well not_implemented not_I not_had not_test not_driven not_a not_coupe not_model not_with not_the not_standard not_5 not_speed not_which not_seemed not_much not_more not_responsive not_I not_find not_a not_lot not_of not_downshifting not_required not_to not_accelerate not_promptly not_on not_the not_highway not_a not_convenient not_overdrive not_off not_button not_on not_the not_shifter not_makes not_this not_somewhat not_easier not_ZX3s not_dont not_seem not_to not_come not_with not_center not_consoles not_which not_leaves not_your not_right not_arm not_sort not_of not_hanging not_Front not_passenger not_seats not_although not_equipped not_with not_a not_handle not_to not_tilt not_out not_of not_the not_rear not_passengers not_way not_do not_not not_automatically not_slide not_out not_of not_the not_way not_as not_do not_many not_other not_small not_cars not_seats not_CD not_player not_cannot not_fast not_forward not_through not_tracks not_a not_minor not_but not_odd not_omission The last entry Ford I had owned was an 82 Mercury Bobcat straight out of college and quality was not not_a not_word not_you not_would not_associate not_with not_that not_car not_Even not_though not_Ford not_markets not_this not_car not_to not_a not_much not_younger not_audience not_I not_found not_that not_it not_had not_a not_number not_of not_features not_that not_appealed not_to not_me not_the not_styling not_a not_bit not_annoying not_at not_first not_grew not_on not_me not_My not_wife not_and not_niece not_think not_the not_car not_is not_cute not_for not_just not_over not_14 not_000 not_paid not_for not_my not_hatchback not_model not_ZX3 not_the not_car not_is not_well not_equipped not_with not_2 not_0L not_Zetec not_engine not_130 not_hp not_power not_windows not_doors not_A not_C not_automatic not_transmission not_more not_on not_that not_later not_cruise not_control not_front not_and not_rear not_mats not_remote not_entry not_system not_and not_alarm not_tilt not_telescoping not_steering not_wheel not_and not_a not_surprisingly not_adequate not_CD not_radio not_combination not_I not_like not_to not_listen not_to not_LOUD not_classical not_music not_with not_plenty not_of not_low not_brass
Pos,This car is designed very well It also provides additional head room of which I am not not_accustomed There is at least a good 3 between the top of my head and the ceiling and for me that is a definite plus The seats are adjustable up and down so im certain that shorter drivers will get as much enjoyment out of this car as taller The additional height makes for a much more comfortable ride for taller drivers im 6 2 because your legs dont not_get not_all not_cramped not_up not_underneath not_the not_dash In short I would highly recommend this car to anyone looking for a smaller but really not not_too not_small that is fun to drive And lets face it the car actually looks pretty good I have read the biographies on the engineering of this car and it was mostly designed in Europe It is slightly wider and longer than the Escort it would probably be more appropriate to compare it to the Contour but I dont not_have not_much not_experience not_with not_that not_particular not_car but the car is MUCH higher The redesign of the Escort Tempo which essentially became the Contour and Taurus in the 1997 model year went very well my Escort required NO major repairs I never even had to get tires on it after 4 years and 70 000 miles and from what im reading the Focus takes even further steps in being a maintenance free car The sleeker design and headlight placement give this car a little more personality than its predecessors the Escort and Contour Passengers that have ridden in the back seat have commented that it is surprisingly comfortable for a small car and the rear leg room was much more than expected Forth its a Ford For a while Ford was a bit of a punchline FORD Fix Or Repair Daily or Found On Road Dead but in the last 5 or so years they have really changed things around I bought my Ford Focus 2000 SE Sony Edition as a new leftover about a month ago and I am extremely pleased with it I bought it to replace my Ford Escort SE which was a decent car but nowhere near as fun as the Focus I have also previously owned a 1990 Subaru Loyale which felt like an old lady car and a 1993 Mitsubishi Eclipse which was not not_a not_very not_good not_car but there was some fun to it and I like the Focus by far the best First handling and driving I have seen a few opinions that say that this car is not not_quite not_as not_peppy not_as not_the not_writers not_expectations not_I not_disagree not_I not_have not_a not_bit not_of not_a not_lead not_foot and I find that the car does quite well at higher speeds I live in Philadelphia and travel on Interstate 95 daily and you have to be able to drive between 75 and 80 mph to keep up It doesnt take the car long to get to those speeds mine is a 5 speed manual Z Tec engine and the car performs very well with no shimmying or shaking The ride is extremely smooth for a small car and pot holes and bumps are barely noticeable which in Philadelphia is almost an impossibility Second features Granted my model is a much more packed model than most of the other Focuses or is it Foci due to the fact that it is a special edition but I dont not_feel not_that not_I not_paid not_an not_exorbitant not_amount not_for not_the not_features not_I not_got not_My not_model not_has not_all not_leather not_seats not_all not_electric not_windows not_mirrors not_etc not_sport not_package not_spoiler not_and not_wheels not_and not_of not_course not_the not_Sony not_XPlode not_stereo not_speaker not_package not_All not_of not_these not_amenities not_are not_easily not_accessible not_to not_the not_driver not_without not_much not_reaching not_due not_not not_only not_to not_the not_fact not_that not_it not_is not_a not_small not_car not_and not_the not_instrument not_panel not_is not_not not_far not_from not_you not_but not_also not_to not_the not_fact not_that not_the not_interior not_engineering not_is not_in not_a not_word not_terrific not_I not_am not_not not_sure not_how not_the not_features not_compare not_on not_the not_base not_model not_but not_I not_would not_say not_that not_if not_you not_are not_going not_to not_buy not_this not_car not_go not_for not_the not_features not_because not_for not_the not_small not_expense not_you not_will not_find not_that not_they not_really not_are not_worth not_it not_Third not_design
Pos,The seats are good Ford has done it again They could use some more bolstering for spirited driving Styling The materials scream quality for 15000 like no other ford ive been in The steering wheel and shifter feel like they have been stolen off an a european sports sedan The interior material also has style something I cant not_say not_for not_most not_value not_oriented not_cars They arent volvo seats but for this size car they are comfortable for long trips and around town Thats a personal opinion I find the car attractive not not_an not_attention not_getter not_but not_not not_too not_cute not_like not_the not_Beetle The interior is wonderfully laid out The stereo is near perfect the right touch button size and distance from both passengers The suspension wow its fun to drive too imagine that Ford has really done it with this car The Zetec four Ford should come clean they must have stolen that off a japanese car smooth nice sound good power no way an American 4 cylinder The engine could be a bit more powerful but I will wait for a SVT version for that A larger wheel tire package would be nice too Comfort This segment is full of buzzing econoboxes but this car stands apart Numbers on its datasheet cant not_tell not_you not_about not_this not_car The Focus package is well put together and solid Airbag equipment is present Its brakes are good Traction control option would be nice added cost though The seats are comfortable the room amazing Im 6 1 250 and I could easy sit in any of the seats the middle rear is a stretch You need to drive it to understand Yea there are cars that can do all of these things better but not at this price The front end is nice but the rest of the car seems a little bland Again this is not not_a not_very not_expensive not_car not_so not_I not_cant not_complain not_Safety not_Almost not_All not_ford not_products not_lets not_not not_get not_into not_tires not_here not_have not_high not_crash not_ratings That is the key For this amount of money its a true value Ford put a lot of thought into the car Safety reliability simplicity performance looks and VALUE Great package Perfomance For this segment its great Acceleration handing and steering are all top of the pack They have crammed a ton of engineering in a sport value package I was extremely impressed by this car From the outside it looks like a new edge design nothing too special there once you get in you know its something different
Pos,I am currently driving a Ford Focus The first thing I noticed after getting in the car was the roominess My husband in the next year or two will be needing a new car and this in in our price range Three of them I dont not_know not_that not_three not_car not_seats not_could not_actually not_fit not_back not_there not_but not_two not_definitely not_could My husband is 6 tall and has no problem fitting in it It feels like you are not not_in not_fact not_in not_a not_compact not_car For me it was uncomfortable to have no place to put my arm Also I had a hard time adjusting the seat back This might be due to engine size but I dont not_know not_what not_size not_it not_has not_One not_last not_thing not_I not_did not_not not_like not_is not_the not_shifter It seems to get great gas mileage I myself prefer my van but hey if someone gave me this car I wouldnt not_turn not_it not_down My van is in the shop and I got this car as a rental I was exited to get it as I was just checking them out on the lot at the dealership But after driving it for the last few days I have been noticing little things that I dont not_like not_about not_it not_One not_is not_the not_fact not_that not_there not_is not_no not_arm not_rest not_between not_the not_front not_seats The car I have is an automatic and you can easily knock the shifter into another gear without pushing in the button A plus of the Focus is that it comes with tether anchors for car seats The car sits a little higher up than other compacts that I have been in You dont not_feel not_like not_someone could drive right over you All in all I thought it was a good basic car Great for a first car or a second family car The handle for it is in an awkward position and I had to open the door to gain access to it Also I understand that the Focus is a compact but it seems to work really hard to get to highway speeds
Pos,What if you re in an iffy neighborhood To wrap up you cant go wrong with this car A note the hatchback is built at Fords factory in Hermosillo Mexico This plant has the highest quality output of all the Ford factories in North America I can attest to the quality as my car has no squeaks or rattles The sedan and wagon are built in Wayne Michigan From what ive heard their quality is good too but the Mexico factory has a better reputation I got the car for 125 over invoice no doc fee at Crystal Ford in Silver Spring Maryland Update 11 2002 Car now has 23 000 miles still not not_a not_single not_problem not_Really not_glad not_I not_bought not_this not_car not_I not_read not_Consumer not_Reports not_they not_say not_that not_the not_Focus not_isnt not_that not_reliable but I think they must be talking about the sedan wagon I have no regrets I think the hatchback would be a great used car for anyone I bought my Focus hatchback in late November 1999 and I now have almost 10 000 miles on it Its the only new car ive ever bought that didnt not_have not_any not_bugs not_Everything not_is not_perfect not_I not_handles not_so not_well not_it not_rides not_nicely not_gets not_decent not_gas not_mileage not_and not_is not_very not_nimble not_easy not_to not_park not_I not_bought not_it not_because not_it not_was not_unusual not_looking not_to not_tell not_the not_truth The Honda Civic was my other choice but that car hasnt changed much in the last 10 years especially the interior I just wanted something that not not_many not_people had and even a year later I dont not_see not_many not_hatchbacks not_mostly not_sedans not_are not_running not_around not_in not_L not_A not_There not_are not_a not_few not_things not_that not_I not_would not_change not_the not_side not_view not_mirrors not_stick not_out not_too not_far not_ive not_almost not_caught not_them not_on not_the not_garage not_wall not_several not_times not_I not_still not_havent not_been not_able not_to not_spot not_the not_oil not_filter not_in not_the not_engine not_compartment not_so not_I not_take not_it not_to not_the not_dealer not_for not_oil not_changes not_I not_liked not_the not_seats not_back not_support not_a not_little not_better not_in not_the not_Civic not_Consumer not_Reports not_recently not_rated not_it not_as not_the not_best not_small not_car not_they not_ve not_tested not_even not_better not_than not_the not_Jetta not_If not_they not_liked not_it not_you not_know not_its not_a not_good not_car not_I not_think not_their not_one not_complaint not_was not_that not_the not_doors not_didnt not_automatically not_unlock not_when not_you not_turn not_off not_the not_car not_Well not_I not_would not_like not_to not_be not_the not_one not_who not_decides not_when not_to not_unlock not_the not_doors
Pos,The engine provides lots of power The car is inexpensive but has a luxury feel My baby car seat fits comfortably in the rear seat The console is attractively designed and has an original look The LED display on the radio gives the time and station simultaneously The manufacturers CD and stereo system operate smoothly and provide decent sound The price is reasonable for what you get The car gets excellent gas mileage and performs well on the highway There is plenty of room in the front and rear seats The windows and mirrors provide good 360 degree visibility For first time car buyers this is THE one I recently purchased the 2000 Ford Focus I am very impressed with the 16 valve 2 0 litre engine It is convenient being able to access the trunk from the interior of the car
Pos,It comes with air bags The car has many safety feature too It has a clear digital mileage display The steering wheel telescopes as well as tilts The overdrive control button is on the gear shift The trunk has a phenomenal amount of room The gas pedal offers just the right amount of tension The chairs were designed for the ultimate in comfort The light which illuminates the dash board is soft and not not_glaring Then there are the cute acronyms Found On Road Dead or Fix Or Repair Daily The brights come on by clicking the turn signal wand toward you once On most 1999 compacts I could not not_even not_find not_the not_control not_for not_the not_brights The cabin light does not not_just not_turn not_off not_suddenly not_it not_fades not_to not_black Not needing to lean over to make these adjustments may avoid an accident Another light control which is usually difficult for me to find is the hazards This was a new one to me because I had never even heard of overdrive before The cabin is large enough so that my boyfriend who is 6 8 could sit comfortably It also comes with special anchors along the top of the back seat to better secure a childs safety seat The top display is the amount of miles you traveled that day and the bottom display is the total miles traveled The turn signals are fairly quiet and unobtrusive so you are not not_stuck not_at not_a not_light not_with not_your not_turn not_signal not_on not_hearing not_an not_annoying not_CLICK not_CLICK not_CLICK I am definitely not not_a not_Ford not_girl not_Everyone not_I not_have not_ever not_known not_who not_has not_owned not_a not_Ford not_has not_called not_it not_a not_nightmarish not_experience This past week however I drove a car that might start to change my mind I had the delight of driving a 2000 Ford Focus The head lights are adjusted using a dial on the dash to the drivers left which change the lights from off to parking lamps to head lights It also comes equipped with quite a few luxury items which I never knew existed but now want in every car I own The driver need not not_press not_the not_pedal not_all not_the not_way not_to not_the not_floor not_just not_to not_go not_sixty but it is not not_so not_sensitive not_that not_you not_sneeze not_and not_poof not_your not_doing not_110 The seat on the drivers chair has a crank which allows you to adjust the seat back to the correct position for you using the minimalist of adjustment The air conditioning system does not not_just not_go not_from not_hot not_to not_cold but has many subtle levels in between Allot of thought was put into every aspect of the Ford Focus On the Ford Focus the hazard lights are controlled by a button on the dash right above the radio where you cannot not_miss not_it not_The not_cars not_gas not_tank not_fills not_with not_about not_11 The radio has an option that allows it to become louder when the engine revs and softer as the car slows down so that you can always hear your radio comfortably It has a gear lock a safety feature which allows you to lock the gears so that you cannot not_move not_the not_car not_out not_of not_park not_with not_out not_pressing not_down not_on not_the not_break not_first If I were to ever break down and purchase a Ford this would have to be the car for me When I first sat in the car it looked like the interior of a jet The trunk has a latch on the inside that allows you to pop the trunk if you should get locked inside it This is a safety feature I think that any person with children should look for in a car The dash board is designed so that all the controls for the air conditioning and the radio as within a comfortable reach of the arm Therefore the driver need not not_lean not_in not_anyway not_to not_adjust not_the not_radio not_or not_control not_the not_temperature not_Often not_when not_people not_lean not_with not_their not_bodies not_inside not_the not_car not_to not_do not_anything not_they not_accidentally not_steer not_the not_car not_in not_that not_direction This car was a dream to handle maneuvered easily and was a joy to drive I do not not_think not_I not_even not_scratched not_the not_surface but for the six days I had the car I practically lived in it If I could find a car that even equals the Ford Focus I might get it But in the end I think I may just have to break down and buy this car
Pos,The cars handling is very crisp and precise The interior is actually reasonably equipped However the handling is an entirely different story The radio controls in this car are fairly large and easy to use However theres quite enough power in the stock unit to overcome most road noise This car had the CD stereo and it sounded fairly good with some distortion at high volumes The power rack and pinion steering is well weighted providing enough resistance to feel just right without being overboosted The car has a very sprightly nimble feel to it that most people will enjoy especially in a car of this class However the pedal feel was too spongy for my liking and the car as a whole felt rather dull as far as powertrain This is a solid well rouned economy car that is also a good budget enthusiasts car With spirited handling and a reasonably comfortable interior this Fords not not_a not_bad not_choice not_at not_all The car rides on 15 diameter wheels with low profile tires Alloy wheels are standard on this model and the split five spoke design fits the car quite well without drawing too much attention to them The engine is reasonably quick to respond and provides good acceleration for a car of this class and price range Stopping power was handled by front disc rear drum brakes and the vehicle stopped reliably The cars transmission shifted well but hunted a bit for gears and hesitated slightly when power was demanded of it While acceptable for a car of this class its not not_a not_sportster not_by not_any not_means Not that there is much For a compact car this vehicle has a well behaved quiet ride Highway irregularities are for the most part ignored and only the bigger stuff gets really noticed Again they ve dialed in just a little bit of that feel that makes a good car great I managed to get ahold of the keys for a new 2000 model year Ford Focus ZX3 Honestly I wasnt not_sure not_what not_to not_expect not_from not_this not_car not_Id not_seen not_small not_Fords not_before not_specifically not_the not_Escort and remembered that that vehicle was characterized by a bare bones interior very little power and sloppy handling The Ford Focus blew most of my expectations out of the water Its equipped with a rather gutsy 2 liter Zetec four cylinder The front buckets are comfortable but I wouldnt not_want not_to not_be not_stuck not_in not_them not_for not_more not_than not_a not_few not_hours not_Rear not_seat not_room is typically cramped as is rear headroom Front headroom however is not not_a not_problem not_Front not_legroom not_on not_the not_other not_hand not_is not_The not_seat not_could not_use not_another not_inch not_or not_two not_of not_travel not_as not_even not_pushed not_all not_the not_way not_back not_it not_was not_just not_not not_far not_back not_enough and my knee brushed against the steering column A tilt wheel is an option and one I reccomend you get Otherwise the guages could be obstructed by the steering wheel
Pos,The seats are very supportive and comfortable on long trips The tranny is matched perfect with the engine providing pretty good acceleration in all gears There are three cupholders in the Focus one in the back of the center console for a rear passenger and two up front The powertrain of my Focus came with the 130 horsepower 2 0 liter Zetec four cylinder mated to a 5 speed manual tranny that motivates the car pretty good The design of the dash is ergonomic and it looks good everything is where it should be within easy reach from the drivers seat and the tilting telescoping steering wheel is a nice addition The only complaint I have about the suspension of the vehicle is that when riding over dips over the road sometimes there is a thump sound from the front of the car The sound system in the Focus is surprisingly good considering that all four of the speakers are in the doors you can turn the volume up and the speakers will not not_distort not_Overall not_I not_love not_my not_Focus and for the money you get a whole lot of car I bought the Focus because of the overall value and quality of the car My Focus came with all the options except a cd changer and it was under 15 grand I love how the car handles and rides I had a Mercury Mystique before the Focus and this car is so much more refined in the ride and comfort of all passengers The front cupholders are allright for soda cans and bottles but dont not_try not_to not_put not_a not_big not_gulp not_in not_them not_because not_the not_dash not_hangs not_down not_too not_low not_Trunk not_space not_is not_a not_very not_respectable not_13 not_cubic not_feet not_and not_the not_fuel not_tank not_holds not_13 not_2 not_gallons not_which not_will not_give not_you not_an not_estimated not_range not_of not_330 not_miles not_in not_town not_based not_on not_25 not_miles not_per not_gallon not_and not_448 not_miles not_on not_the not_highway not_based not_on not_34 not_miles not_a not_gallon
Pos,The car easily cruises at 90 100 mph even in the uphill sections The car is excellent Absolutely no wind noise very little road noise and decent if not not_abundant power It is too bad that the 5 door apparently isnt not_sold not_here not_in not_the not_US not_It not_is not_the not_best not_version not_with not_the not_versatility not_of not_the not_4 not_doors not_with not_the not_styling not_of not_the not_coupe I had the opportunity to rent a 5 door Focus in Germany earlier this year I drove it from Cologne down to Mannheim and back twice and also hit the twisties along the Mosel river The car also does a respectable job in the stoplight grand prix if the competition is not not_to not_stout not_I not_can not_only not_confirm not_what not_has not_already not_been not_written not_about not_the not_handling not_even not_with not_the not_skinny not_rental not_tires The driving position fit this 6 4 240 pounder perfectly I also rented a 4 door sedan with auto trans here in the US Other than the expected lack of grunt with the auto I found this version a superb car
Pos,No slushboxes allowed in our vehicles The one thing we do agree on is four cylinders 5 speeds We took a drive in the ZX3 and it was love at first sight We both expect a vehicle to perform and have a reasonable level of over the road comfort What caught my eye this time was the one vehicle that had two doors a manual transmission and a very non conforming appearence The car has what I consider to be a very European appearence no glitz everything is where it is for a reason My wife is a fan of small cars but shares my opinion about the cookie cutter sameness of the majority of sub compact offerings available today I am not not_generally not_a not_fan not_of not_small not_cars not_especially not_the not_four not_door not_econobox not_variety not_I not_am not_a not_fairly not_good not_sized not_person not_and not_like not_my not_space not_when not_I not_drive On a whim we recently stopped at a Ford dealer who had a number of Focus cars on the lot I had looked at the four door model before and was not not_impressed not_enough not_to not_drive not_one not_since not_they not_had not_all not_contained not_automatic not_transmissions The vehicle accelerates and handles far out of expectation to its sticker price Finally the seat was more confortable than the standard size car we had just test driven at another dealer I did not not_feel not_confined and my wife did not not_have not_the not_big not_car not_blues not_Bottom not_line not_is not_that not_the not_Focus not_ZX3 not_is not_the not_pick not_of not_the not_litter not_in not_the not_low not_cost not_small not_car not_class not_we not_bought not_it
Pos,The car handles and drives like a much more expensive vehicle The only bad thing about the car is the poorly designed and placed cupholders They sit on either side and in front of the Gear Shift Lever It was also announced this week that the Focus is top selling car in the world The vehicle itself is very roomy extremely comfortable in both front and back and plenty of legroom too It puts out 130 hp and is plenty powerful for 4 Adults in the car and even on hilly terrain To go along with all the awards all I have to say is watch out Toyota and Honda here comes the Ford Focus This leaves little room to reach a cup and is very limiting to size of cup as well Not a huge issue to an otherwise Great Little Car We had a 1997 Camry that did not not_ride not_or not_drive not_any not_where not_near not_as not_nice not_as not_the not_Focus not_We not_got not_the not_Z not_Tec not_Engine not_as not_part not_of not_the not_Sport not_Group not_and not_would not_say not_that not_would not_the not_engine not_i not_would not_recommend It is one awsome stereo and will drive you out of the vehicle if you really crank it up I have never heard such a wonderful clear sound in a vehicle until we bought this Sony Focus I would really recommend this to anyone who loves music all comes wrapped in a great vehicle In June we bought the Sony Limited Edition Focus SE 4 DR Sedan Simply put this is one great little car We have the vehicle equipped with AT PS PB PW PDL CC Tilt Wheel Comfort Group Sport Group Alarm w Keyless Entry and the AWSOME Sony Xplod Stereo The Sony Limited Edition Focus is a Limited Production of 7000 Vehicles and comes in AT amp 5 spd and is only available in four color choices Green Black Infa Red amp Going Platinum with the last being unique only to the Sony Edition The Sony Xplod has a CD Head unit w 30 pre sets a CD Player w remote and a 450 watt Amplifier amp 12 Sub Woofer mounted in the trunk
Pos,This car is amazing The car handles extremely well The finish and fit are both excellent The seats offer great support too The radio sound system is on the boomy side The car is inexpensive to operate The steering is precise with good road feedback The trunk door height is just perfect for loading things It gets about 28 MPG on regular gasoline We have owned Toyotas Acuras Hondas VWs Cadillacs Buicks and Oldsmobiles The car tends to be a little noisy The transmission is as smooth as you can find After 140 000 miles we decided to replace my wifes 1990 Toyota Camry My wife is 5 7 and can adjust the seat to fit her perfectly The interior light stays on after you leave the car and then gradually dims and shuts off The manual seat adjusters take a little getting used to Ford does not not_have not_a not_sunroof not_option The brakes are ABS front disks and rear drums and in our experience offer good stopping And the 15 tires arent Firestone This is the first car we have owned that makes it easy to load groceries So we started shopping around Much to our amazement we ended up buying a Ford Focus station wagon with the ZTEC engine It is the easiest car to get in and out of and has great seats really important if you have a bad back This is our first Ford and it is without a doubt the best value for the money we have ever seen in an automobile We found the new Camrys to be overpriced offering essentially 1990 technology with seats that werent as adjustable or as comfortable as the old ones The design and placement of the instruments and controls and even the dashboard vents couldnt be better Ford really took consumers into account when this car was designed The car is loaded with features electric windows locks trunk door release cruise control mirrors CD player power brakes tilt steering wheel automatic transmission center arm rest cup holders filtered air HVAC system etc There have been two recalls since we bought the car an inconvenience to deal with In summary the Focus station wagon is a real bargain for most anyone They seem to have just the right amount of firmness and are designed to help you sit properly without slouching There is plenty of room in the back seat too The car has a few disadvantages but I would not not_call not_them not_problems not_Even not_with not_the not_ZTEC not_engine not_its not_not not_as not_powerful not_as not_I not_would not_like but its more responsive than the four cyl Camry that we replaced The doors open wide the seats sit high and the car has a high roof line the seating couldnt be much better im 6 5 and can sit with inches to spare between the top of my head and the roof
Pos,This car also looks awesome The buttons feel a little fragile The Ford Focus is a great little record setting car This means that the cabin is extremely roomy The only real down side to the Focus is the interior In my opinion it could have been made much nicer It is cheap and gives you a lot of car The new edge design that Ford uses gives this car a clean sporty distinctive look The Ford staff designed a suit which made the wearer feel more elderly In the month of July the Focus was the 10th best selling vehicle in America with about 30 000 units It is the first car to ever win North American Car of the Year and European Car of the Year awards This made it possible for them to design a car that is more friendly to older drivers And it definitely deserves it This car is the same overall length as the Escort but the wheelbase is about 5 inches longer It was given the revered Automobile of the Year status and is great for any kind of person with a low budget for a car It is possible that the new Volvo S40 and V50 will be built on this platform but this isnt not_definite not_Overall not_this not_car not_is not_a not_steal The roof is high enabling the driver to sit up higher and provide more room in every direction Designed in Europe it is extremely easy for older people to use If the looks dont not_hook not_you not_the not_drive will I recommend the ZX3 model because it is the cheapest and has the most standard features 2 0 zetec engine at about 130 bhp CD player standard etc The seats are great but the headrests are terrible My 96 Nissan Sentra has a very nice interior it is simple and durable Overall the Focus is a great car and it leads the class in almost every way It is hard to figure out which of the models sedan wagon ZX3 coupe looks the best but the wagon is definitely very functional Ford has scratched plans for an MPV vehicle and will probably not not_build not_a not_coupe not_model
Pos,It rides nicely on the streets but rough going up a steep hill its very comforting driving a long ride when the seat is up it makes you feel on the same level of a SUV This is certainly a great economical car I think anybody who is looking for a small affordable car with a midsize car feel once you sit inside you will love the car The way the seats feel is very comfortable im not not_to not_found not_of not_the not_lumbar not_when not_it not_is not_lowered not_too not_low not_it not_leaves not_a not_big not_space not_it not_needs not_a not_little not_more not_horsepower not_though I needed a new car because my hyundai excel 91 had it so I decided to shop around for a nice small car with a affordable price tag I wasnt not_really not_thinking not_about not_american not_car because of all the negative talk I was thinking more of a Honda Accord Nissan Altima jetta So I went to the closest car place which so happens to be Ford so I browsed around for a bit see what I would like I just knew I wasnt not_going not_to not_see not_nothing not_I not_like and there it was a car I thought ford didnt not_make not_a not_car not_that not_stood not_out not_from not_the not_rest not_of not_their not_cars not_the not_Focus This car was really different when I looked inside the window and saw the inside and saw how spacious it was for a small car so I said to myself they probably want alot for this car I looked at the ticket price and said I have to have this car this is in my budget I love the roomy interior and easy the controls are to reach
Pos,One small problem is that the cup holders cant not_accommodate not_large not_beverages The styling on the Focus also appeals to me and to my inquisitive neighbors The SE model I own has power windows and door locks keyless entry tilt wheel cruise control and other options Gas mileage is about 32 on the highway not not_great but good Trunk room is surprisingly adequate Another problem is that the car doesnt seem well insulated against road noise Hey I regularly drive a Saturn and a Toyota Corolla The Focus beats them readily in performance interior room and value I am very pleased with this purchase Let me jump on that bandwagon too Steering is responsive and the car which has 15 inch tires hugs the road One caution to prospective purchasers read the manual The Focus comes with several design features that initially may create the appearance of being minor malfunctions The 2000 Ford Focus SE 4 door sedan has a spacious interior and a solid feel im the only person in my neighborhood to own one and nearby friends and acquaintances regularly ask me how this stylish and affordable car performs Among the first things I tell them is to spend a little extra money and buy a Focus model that includes the perky 16 valve Zetec engine This adds several hundred dollars to the purchase price but the investment is worth it if you value passing performance on the freeway and climbing ability on hills I drove 2000 and 2001 models with the underpowered standard engine and came away disappointed Zetec is definitely the way to go Ford engineered the Focus to provide a roomy interior and did so with great success One of these is the air conditioning light that signals the air conditioning is in use During certain times this light comes on automatically as part of a design feature that apparently dehumidifies the air in the car to minimize frosting ive read some reviews in which people didnt not_read not_the not_owners not_manual and reported a suspected malfunction of the air conditioning unit My head always bumped the ceiling in my Escort the car I traded when I bought the Focus in November 2000 Head rattling is not not_an not_issue not_with not_the not_Focus not_Seat not_height not_is not_adjustable not_and not_leg not_room not_for not_a not_person not_of not_my not_height not_6 not_ft not_is not_more not_than not_ample not_Front not_seat not_passengers not_gain not_the not_most not_from not_the not_cab not_forward not_design not_Passengers not_in not_the not_rear not_may not_feel not_a not_bit not_squeezed not_if not_passengers not_in not_the not_front not_use not_the not_maximum not_amount not_of not_legroom not_My not_Focus not_came not_with not_a not_CD not_player not_and not_AM not_FM not_radio not_Sound not_quality not_is not_not not_concert not_like not_but not_I not_didnt not_expect not_it not_to not_be not_Id not_rate not_it not_better not_than not_adequate not_ive not_read not_a not_number not_of not_reviews not_that not_said not_the not_Focus not_was not_fun not_to not_drive
